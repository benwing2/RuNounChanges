==Parameters==
Normally there is only one parameter to specify, e.g. for {{m|hi|लड़का||boy}}, on that page:
:{{temp|hi-ndecl|<M>}}

which produces

{{hi-ndecl|लड़का<M>}}

The general format is a lemma followed by angle brackets, within which are declensional properties. The lemma can be omitted when it's the same as the page title, as in the above example.

For almost all nouns, at least the gender needs to be given within angle brackets: <code>M</code> for masculine, <code>F</code> for feminine. Some nouns need additional properties, e.g. {{m|hi|पिता||father}}, which follows the "unmarked" declension (i.e. there is no direct masculine ending to be removed; instead, endings are added onto the full lemma):
:{{temp|hi-ndecl|<M.unmarked>}}

which produces

{{hi-ndecl|पिता<M.unmarked>}}

===Declension===
Normally, it is enough to specify the gender of a noun, and the declension will be deduced based on the ending. However, there are two cases where the same ending can have two possible declensions:
1. Masculine nouns in ''-ā''. By default the direct plural ends in ''-ē'' and the oblique plural in ''-õ'', which is correct for most nouns. However, some nouns, such as {{m|hi|पिता||father}}, have the direct plural in ''-ā'' and the oblique plural in ''-āõ''. These "unmarked" nouns need the <code>unmarked</code> indicator, as described above.
2. Feminine nouns in ''-iyā''. By default, these are treated like any other feminine noun in ''-ā'', with the direct plural in ''-āẽ'' and the oblique plural in ''-āõ''. An example of such a noun is {{m|hi|कनिया||girl}}. Some such nouns, however, have the direct plural in ''-iyã'' and the oblique plural in ''-iyõ''. An example is {{m|hi|तौलिया||towel}}. These nouns need the <code>iyā</code> indicator:
:{{temp|hi-ndecl|<F.iyā>}}

which produces

{{hi-ndecl|तौलिया<F.iyā>}}

===Explicit term===
You can explicitly specify the term to decline. This allows you, for example, to decline a term on a different page from the page of the term being declined. It is also necessary when more than one part of a term declines (see below), or when one word of a multiword term needs phonetic respelling (see below). For example, the above declension of {{m|hi|पिता||father}} could be specified as follows:
:{{temp|hi-ndecl|पिता<M.unmarked>}}

===Phonetic respelling===
Some terms have nonstandard transliterations. This can be indicated using phonetic respelling, i.e. spell out the word phonetically in Devanagari, using virama to force no ''a'' in a given position and <code>*</code> to force an ''a'' in a given position. To specify this, use <code>//</code> followed by the phonetic respelling, e.g. for {{m|hi|अंतराल|tr=antarāl||interval}}:
:{{temp|hi-ndecl|//अंत*राल<M>}}

which produces

{{hi-ndecl|अंतराल//अंत*राल<M>}}

Here, we use phonetic respelling with a <code>*</code> in it to force the transliteration ''antarāl'' instead of the default ''antrāl''.

You can also specify the transliteration directly after <code>//</code>, but using respelling is preferred.

{{hi-ndecl|((कीड़ा<M>-मकोड़ा<M>,<M>))}}
{{hi-ndecl|काला<+> पहाड़<M>}}
{{hi-ndecl|पंचायती//पंचाय*ती राज<M>}}
{{hi-ndecl|परमात्मा की प्रार्थना//प्रार्थ्ना<F>}}
{{hi-ndecl|((<M>,<M.plstem:फ़तूह.dirpl:फ़तूह>))}}
{{hi-ndecl|<M.plstem:अहम.dirpl:अहं>}}
{{hi-ndecl|<M.plstem:ओम.dirpl:ॐ>}}
