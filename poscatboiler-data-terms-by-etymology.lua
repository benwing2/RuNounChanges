-- Specs describing types of borrowings.
-- `from_source_desc` is the English description used in categories of the form "LANGUAGE BORTYPE from SOURCE",
--    e.g. "Arabic semantic loans from English". "SOURCE" in the description is replaced by the source language.
-- `umbrella_desc` is the English description used in categories of the form "LANGUAGE BORTYPE", e.g.
--    "Arabic semantic loans". This is an umbrella category grouping all the source-language-specific categories.
-- `uses_subtype_handler`, if true, means that the handler for "LANGUAGE BORTYPE from SOURCE" categories is
--    implemented by a generic "TYPE borrowings" handler (at the bottom of this section), so we don't need to
--    create a BORTYPE-specific handler.
-- `umbrella_parent`, if given, is the parent category of the umbrella categories of the form "LANGUAGE BORTYPE".
--    By default it is "borrowed terms". Some borrowing types replace this with "terms by etymology". (FIXME:
--    Review whether this is correct.)
-- `label_pattern`, if given, is a Lua pattern that matches the category name minus the language at the beginning.
--    It should have one capture, which is the source language. An example is "^terms partially calqued from (.+)$".
--    If omitted, it is generated from BORTYPE.
-- `no_by_language`, if true, means that the umbrella category grouping borrowings of the appropriate type from a
--    specific source language is named "BORTYPE from SOURCE" in place of "BORTYPE from SOURCE by language"
--    (e.g. "Semantic loans from English" in place of "Semantic loans from English by language").
-- `categorizing_templates`, if given, is the list of templates that categorize into this category. They are assumed to
--    follow the syntax of {{bor}}. The first template in the list should be the preferred alias. The specified
--    templates are used to form the `additional` text displayed on the language-specific category page and
--    corresponding umbrella category page describing how to categorize into the category in question. In more complex
--    cases, you can omit this field and instead supply the `additional` and `umbrella_additional` fields (as is done
--    with adapted borrowings). You must either specify `categorizing_templates` or the combination of `additional` and
--    `umbrella_additional`.
--  `additional`, if given, is a function of two arguments (source and destination language objects) that will generate
--    the `additional` text displayed on the language-specific category page that describes how to categorize into the
--    category in question. This is an alternative to specifying `categorizing_templates`, used in more complex cases
--    (currently, with adapted borrowings).
--  `umbrella_additional`, if given, is a function of one argument (source language object) that will generate the
--    `additional` text displayed on the umbrella category page that describes how to categorize into the category in
--    question. This is an alternative to specifying `categorizing_templates`, used in more complex cases (currently,
--    with adapted borrowings).
