* एमएलए: how declined? and is tr=emele correct? (auto tr=emaelae)
* ग़ुस्लख़ाना: should this be tr=guslxānā?

* समुदाय: how is this pronounced? pronun and translit disagree
* शाह: how is this pronounced? pronun and translit disagree
* रहस्य: how is this pronounced? pronun disagrees with translit and Urdu
* रस्म: how is this pronounced? pronun gives [ˈɾə.səm]|[ɾəsm] but it has a virama
* रत्न: how is this pronounced? pronun gives [ɾəˈt̪ən̪] only but it has a virama
* तत्त्व: pronunciation and translit disagree
* दलदल: tr=daldal, tr=daladal, or both?
* नागरिकता: tr=nāgriktā, tr=nāgrikatā or both?
* सामी: does this actually mean "Semites, Semitic people" or "Semitic person"?
* कन्नड़: This has two pronuns, one with final ''-a'', I'm assuming it should have two translits.
* केरल: Should this have translit/pronun ''kerala''? Urdu equivalent کیرلا has final ''-a''.
* गुजरात: this has two etymologies, one a state "Gujarat" and one a city "Gujrat" but both given with the same pronun; should they be different?
* पुराना नियम: is this declined differently in the oblique sg?
* बंजारा: defined as "the Banjara or Lambadi people", should it actually be "member of the Banjara or Lambadi people"?
* बक़रीद: should this be tr=baqarīd not default tr=baqrīd?
* मित्र: should this be tr=mitr not default tr=mitra? Urdu is متر without any final vowel, which is normally indicated.
* मोंटेनीगरो: gender? given as masculine but with attention note asking to check gender.
* यहूदा इस्करियोती: does the first part decline differently in the oblique?
* रोमानिया, सेंट लूसिया: given as feminine, is this correct? most countries in -yā are masculine.
* ऑस्ट्रिया: given as both masc and fem, is this correct? most countries in -yā are masculine.
* लैला और मजनू: I have marked this as masculine singular-only, is that correct?
* विराटनगर: I have changed the tr to tr=virāṭnagar, correct?
* शाहमुखी: I have assumed this to be feminine as other scripts appear to be feminine.
* शिंदे, शिगात्से, सरवटे: How is this declined? I have assumed it to be indeclinable.
* शिव: Given with two pronunciations, one with final long ''-ā''. Is this correct? Maybe it's actually a final short ''-a''? The translit needs to be updated.
* शुक्र: How should it be pronounced and transliterated? Presumably as tr=śukr not default tr=śukra, per the Urdu شکر?
* हवाई: Is feminine correct? It's marked as "check this".
* अति (likewise अभिव्यक्ति): Given with pronun like this: {{temp|hi-IPA||अती}} Is this intended to indicate two pronuns, one with short final ''-i'' and the other with long final ''-ī''? If so it doesn't work.
* अतिसंवेदनशील: This has translit atisãvedanśīl but the pronunciation uses a respelling to indicate /ə.t̪ɪ.səm.ʋeː.d̪ən.ʃiːl/, without a nasal vowel before the ''v''. Is this correct and/or normal? If normal, should we fix the translit to not make it a nasal vowel?
* अग्निशस्त्र: pronun has respelling अग्नीशस्त्र indicating a long ''-ī-'' in the middle. Is this correct and/or normal? The same respelling is not done to अग्निशमन, अग्निपरीक्षा or अग्निशामक
* अज्ञेयवाद: at this point it has pronun respelling अज्ञेय॰वाद, which has no effect. Is this correct? Same for अज्ञेयवादी with pronun respelling अज्ञेय॰वादी.
* अनुपस्थित: pronun has respelling अनूपस्थित indicating a long ''-ū-'' in the middle. Is this correct and/or normal? There are a large number of other words in ''anu-'' without similar respelling.
* अम्लता (likewise अम्लपित्त): Given with two pronuns अम्ल-ता and अम्लता. This causes two pronuns /əm.lᵊ.t̪ɑː/, [ə̃m.l̪ᵊ.t̪äː] and /əm.lə.t̪ɑː/, [ə̃m.l̪ə.t̪äː]. This appears to indicate that reduced schwa is phonemic. Should we be transliterating it as ''ă''?


* Assuming unmarked: अरोरा, अस्थाना, ओबामा, कच्छारा, कुशवाहा, गुप्ता, झा, मखीजा, मल्होत्रा, मादरेचा, मित्रा, मिश्र, मेहता, वर्मा, वागरेचा, शर्मा, सक्सेना, सिसोदिया

* अर्जेन्टीना, अर्जेंटीना: Note to self: Put main at अर्जेण्टीना.
* अल्पसंख्यक: Still syllabifies badly as /əl.p.səŋ.kʰjək/ with respelling अल्प-संख्यक. Same for ऑक्सफ़ोर्ड with respelling ऑक्स-फ़ोर्ड, syllabified as /ɔk.s.pʰoːɾɖ/.
* असंवेदनशील: Pronunciation says /ə.səm.ʋeː.d̪ən.ʃiːl/ but translit asãvedanśīl. Is the pronunciation normal in cases of anusvara + ''v''? If normal, should we fix the translit to not make it a nasal vowel? Same issue in अतिसंवेदनशील, संवेदनशील, असंवैधानिक, संवैधानिक.
* असहयोग: Pronunciation says /ə.səʱ.joːɡ/, what does the raised ʱ after a vowel mean?
* अहंकार: Manual pron respelling forces [ɛ.ɦɛ̃ŋ.käːɾ] and [eː.ɦẽː.käːɾ], is this a special exception or something that should be handled by default?
* आठों पहर, पहर: Manual respellings force [äː.ʈʰõː‿pəʱɾ] but /peːʱɾ/; one is presumably wrong. Also, is this an exceptional pronun?
* आत्महत्या: Pronun given as /ɑːt̪.mᵊ.ɦət̪.jɑː/, should this use translit ātmăhatyā?
* आवाज़: Pronun given as /ə.ʋɑːz/, /ɑː.ʋɑːz/. Should the translit follow?
* इकहत्तर: Pronun given as /ɪ.kʰət̪.t̪əɾ/ or /ɪ.kət̪.t̪əɾ/, should the first actually be /ɪk.ɦət̪.t̪əɾ/?
* उदाहरण: Second pronun given as /ʊ.d̪ʱɑː.ɾəɳ/, should this actually be /ʊd̪.ɦɑː.ɾəɳ/? Also should there be a second translit to reflect this pronun?
* उन्होंने: Pronun is rendered as /ʊn.ɦoːn.neː/, which is probably wrong.
* ऊँचा: Should second pronun /uː.t͡ʃɑː/ be reflected in the translit?
* एकड़: Should second pronun /eː.kəɾ/ be reflected in the translit?
* एहसान: Is /ə.ɦə.sɑːn/, [ɛ.ɦɛ.s̪ä̃ːn̪] correct as the only pronun? If so, how should this be reflected in the translit (currently ''ehsān'', which is wrong)?
* ऐयाशी: Is second pronun /əj.jɑː.ʃiː/ correct? If so, should it be reflected in the translit?
* कम्युनिज़म: Second pronun given as /kəm.jʊ.nɪz.mᵊ/, I changed it to /kəm.jʊ.nɪzm/. Correct?
* कर्मभूमि: Note to self: Change translit handling of final -rm.
* ख़त्म करना: First pronun is /kʰət̪.mə‿.kəɾ.nɑː/. Is that intended? ख़त्म by itself is /kʰə.t̪əm/ or /xət̪m/.
* खींचना: First pronun is /kʰiːɲ.t͡ʃnɑː/, is that correct in light of recent discussions?
* जन्मदिन: Can this be pronounced either ''janmadin'' or ''janamdin'', despite the spelling?
* ज़र्रा: Pronun given as ''zarraa'', causes /zəɾ.ɾə.ᵊ/. What does this mean?
* ज़ेहन: Pronun given as ज़हन, yielding [zɛ.ɦɛ̃n̪]. Correct?
* जातिवाद: Pronun given as जातीवाद, with long ''-ī-''. Correct? Likewise जातिवादी.
* तनख़्वाह: All given pronuns are lacking the व. Correct?
* धर्मशाला: Pronun gives /d̪ʱə.ɾəm.ʃɑː.lɑː/ despite the virama. Correct?
* पेंशन: Auto translit pẽśan but pronun /peːn.ʃən/. Is pronun correct? If so, should the translit change? Do all words in anusvara + ''ś'' work this way?
* फ्रेन्चाइज़: Note to self: This is a nuqtaless form serving as the main entry. Fix it.
* चाँदी: Two pronuns given, चाँदी and चांदी, which produce the same results. I removed them. Likewise सूँघना and बाँधना.
* भैंस: Has pronun respelling भैँस, which is the same as the title. I removed it. Likewise भैंसा, भौंह, सांप, सौंह; also मँगवाना, मँगेतर (in the opposite direction).
* मधुमेह: Has respelling मधू-मेह. Is this predictable?
* मानवीय: Pronun disagrees with translit.
* मैंने: Pronun is /mɛːn.neː/, almost certainly wrong.
* संकलक: Why is the pronun respelling given as संक-अलक? Seems wrong.
* संवाद: Pronun has /səm.ʋɑːd̪/ but translit sãvād. Which is correct? Likewise संवाददाता, संवेदनशील, संवैधानिक
* सर्वसाधारण: Translit was sarvasādhāraṇ, I changed it to sarvsādhāraṇ, and pronun accordingly. Likewise सर्वहारा.
* सिंहला: Pronun given as /sɪ̃ʱ.lɑː/. Correct?
* स्वायत्तता: Pronun given as /sʋɑː.jət̪t̪.t̪ɑː/. Does it really have three t's in a row?
