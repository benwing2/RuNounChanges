==Usage==
This template is designed for the [[lemma]] of all Italian [[verb]]s. Only use this template for the verb's [[lemma]] entry. For non-lemma forms, use {{temp|head|it|verb form}}.

This template should be placed in all Italian verb sections, immediately following the ===Verb=== section header. It provides the inflection line for the entry. The template also automatically categorizes the entry in [[:Category:Italian verbs]] and the appropriate category for the auxiliary, e.g. [[:Category:Italian verbs taking essere as auxiliary]].

As with other Wiktionary inflection templates, '''please do not use <code>subst:</code>'''.

===Regular ''-are'' verbs===
This verb normally takes a single parameter, which specifies the auxiliary as well as the first singular present indicative, first singular past historic, and past participle. If you are not sure of the correct conjugation, you can leave out all parameters, and the headword will not have any inflected forms specified. However, this is not recommended.

For regular ''-are'' verbs, the parameter normally takes the form ''AUX/VOWEL'', where ''AUX'' is either <code>a</code> for [[avere]] or <code>e</code> for [[essere]], and ''VOWEL'' (termed a ''single-vowel spec'') is the stressed vowel in the present singular with the appropriate stress mark (acute or grave) added to indicate the vowel quality (i.e. it should be one of <code>à è é ì ò ó ù</code>). For example, for {{m|it|ordinare||to order}}, use the following:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/ó}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/ó|pagename=ordinare}}

Note that all the verb forms in the headword include an accent specifying the stress as well as the quality of stressed ''e'' and ''o'', even though Italian normally does not mark the stress or quality except when the stress is word-final. Accordingly, the verb forms are linked using the appropriate standard spelling without the extra stress marks.

If the last two vowels of the stem are the same, add <code>-</code> after the vowel to specify that the leftmost of the two vowels (i.e. the [[antepenultimate]]) is stressed, and <code>+</code> to indicate that the rightmost of the two vowels (the [[penultimate]]) is stressed. For example, for {{m|it|detestare||to detest}}, use the following:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/è+}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/è+|pagename=detestare}}

Meanwhile, for {{m|it|metallificare||to become metallic}}, use:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/ì-}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/ì-|pagename=metallificare}}

'''NOTE''': The "last two vowels" for which stress and quality can be specified are normally the last two written vowels of the stem, even if one of the vowels isn't pronounced. For example, for {{m|it|cominciare||to begin}}, the stem is ''cominci-'' and the last two vowels that can be specified using a single-vowel spec are both ''i'', even though the second ''i'' isn't pronounced. Hence the specification <code>ì-</code> must be used to get the correct stress pattern ''io comìncio''. There are only two exceptions:
# The ''u'' in ''-qu-'' is not considered a vowel, as it can never be stressed. Hence, for {{m|it|liquidare||to liquidate}}, stem ''liquid-'', present singular ''io lìquido'', the two vowels that can be specified using a single-vowel spec are both i'', and the specification <code>ì-</code> should be used.
# The ''u'' in ''-au-'' + consonant is not considered a vowel if another vowel follows in the stem. Hence, for {{m|it|laureare||to confer a university degree}}, stem ''laure-'', present singular ''io làureo'', the two vowels ''a'' and ''e'' are those that can be specified using a single-vowel spec, and the specification <code>à</code> should be used. The verb {{m|it|augurare||to augur}} behaves similarly. The ''u'' in ''-au-'' is not skipped if no vowel follows, which allows e.g. {{m|it|spaurare||to frighten}}, present singular (io) ''spaùro'', to be specified using <code>ù</code>.
Very occasionally a verb's stress pattern falls afoul of these rules, e.g. {{m|it|coniugare||to conjugate}}, present singular ''io còniugo'', where the third from the last vowel is stressed using the above rules. These must be treated as irregular and the full present tense specified; see below.

===Regular ''-ire'' verbs===
For regular ''-ire'' verbs that do ''not'' take the ''-isc-'' infix, use the same form as for ''-are'' verbs. For example, for {{m|it|partire||to depart}}, present tense ''io pàrto'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/à}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/à|pagename=partire}}

For regular ''-ire'' verbs that take the ''-isc-'' infix, use <code>+isc</code> in place of the vowel spec. For example, for {{m|it|punire||to punish}}, present tense ''io punìsco'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/+isc}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/+isc|pagename=punire}}

===Regular ''-ere'' verbs===
For regular ''-ere'' verbs stressed as ''-ére'', use the same form as above. For example, for {{m|it|temere|temére|to fear}}, present tense ''io témo'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/é}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/é|pagename=temere}}

Note that both alternative past historic forms are given in the output by default.

For regular ''-ere'' verbs stressed on the stem, use a backslash in place of the slash (mnemonic: the forward slash leans to the right for the more rightward stress, and the backslash leans to the left for the more leftward stress). For example, for {{m|it|abbattere|abbàttere|to throw down, to knock down}}, present tense ''io abbàtto'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\à+}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\à+|pagename=abbattere}}

Here <code>à+</code> must be used because there are two ''a'''s among the last two vowels of the stem. The backslash indicates that the stress on the infinitive, displayed in the headword, should be taken from the present tense rather than placed on the ending.

Note that the default for verbs in ''-cere'' and ''-gere'' uses a hard ''c''/''g'' in the present but a soft ''ci''/''gi'' in the past participle, which is correct for the majority of verbs, e.g. {{m|it|conoscere||to know (a person), to recognize}}, with present ''io conósco'', past participle ''conosciùto''.

===Irregular verbs===
For irregular verbs, specify up to three principal parts (first-singular present, first-singular past historic and past participle), separated by commas. For example for {{m|it|scomparire||to disappear, to die}}, use:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/scompàio,scompàrvi,scompàrso}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/scompàio,scompàrvi,scompàrso|pagename=scomparire}}

You can omit the past participle if it is regularly constructed, or both the past historic and past participle if both are regularly constructed. For example, for {{m|it|piacere||to please}}, with regularly formed past participle ''piaciùto'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/piàccio,piàcqui}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/piàccio,piàcqui|pagename=piacere}}

For root-stressed verbs in ''-ere'', use a backslash in place of a slash, as above, e.g. for {{m|it|scuotere||to shake}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\ò,scòssi,scòtto}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\ò,scòssi,scòtto|pagename=scuotere}}

As mentioned above, when a backslash is specified the position and quality of the stress is derived from the present tense single-vowel spec. If the present tense is irregular, specify it in full and include the single-vowel spec ''before'' the backslash, e.g. as follows for {{m|it|scegliere||to choose}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\é\scélgo,scélsi,scélto}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\é\scélgo,scélsi,scélto|pagename=scegliere}}

If a given principal part has more than one possibility, separate the possiblities by a colon, e.g. for {{m|it|riempire||to fill}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/é,riempìi,riempìto:riempiùto}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/é,riempìi,riempìto:riempiùto|pagename=riempire}}

Note that you can use a <code>+</code> to request the default form(s). Thus, the above spec for {{m|it|riempire}} could (and preferably would) be written as follows:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/é,+,+:riempiùto}}

You can specify ''qualifiers'' following a given form, which helps give usage notes when there are multiple forms with differing uses, e.g. for {{m|it|comparire||to appear, to manifest, to seem; (law) to appear before a tribunal}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/compàio:+isc[less common],compàrvi:comparìi[less common]:compàrsi[in the legal sense],compàrso}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/compàio:+isc[less common],compàrvi:comparìi[less common]:compàrsi[in the legal sense],compàrso|pagename=comparire}}

Here, there are two possible present tense forms (''compàio'' and ''comparìsco'') and three possible past historic forms (''compàrvi'', ''comparìi'', ''compàrsi''), with differing usage characteristics.

Note that there is no requirement that multiple forms be present when qualifiers are used. For example, for {{m|it|soccombere||to succumb}}, whose past participle is rare, use the following:
:{{temp|it-verb|e\ó+,+,+[rare]}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e\ó+,+,+[rare]|pagename=soccombere}}

===Specifying additional irregular forms===
For highly irregular verbs, it sometimes makes sense to include additional irregular forms in the headword. For example, {{m|it|cadere||to fall}} has irregular future ''cadrò'', ''cadrài'', etc. To add the first-person singular future to the headword, use a spec like <code>fut:FORM</code>, separated from the principal parts by a period, as follows:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/à,càddi.fut:cadrò}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/à,càddi.fut:cadrò|pagename=cadere}}

Similarly, for {{m|it|tenere||to hold}}, to specify an irregular future ''terrò'' and irregular imperative singular ''tièni'', use:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/tèngo,ténni.fut:terrò.imp:tièni}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/tèngo,ténni.fut:terrò.imp:tièni|pagename=tenere}}

A more complicated example is {{m|it|essere||to be}}, with numerous irregularities:
:{{it-verb|e\è\sóno,fùi,stàto.imperf:èro.fut:sarò.sub:sìa.impsub:fóssi.imp:sìi}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e\è\sóno,fùi,stàto.imperf:èro.fut:sarò.sub:sìa.impsub:fóssi.imp:sìi|pagename=essere}}

The full list of recognized additional irregular forms is as follows:
{|class="wikitable"
! Prefix !! Form
|-
| <code>imperf</code> || first-singular imperfect indicative
|-
| <code>fut</code> || first-singular future indicative
|-
| <code>sub</code> || first-singular present subjunctive
|-
| <code>impsub</code> || first-singular imperfect subjunctive
|-
| <code>imp</code> || second-singular imperative
|}

To specify multiple possibilities for a given irregular form, separate the possibilities by colons, as above. Qualifiers in brackets can be appended to a given form, as above. See the example for {{m|it|dare}} just below for an example of this.

===Special considerations with single-syllable irregular forms===
With verbs with single-syllable irregular forms, there are some special considerations. For one thing, there may or may not be a written accent on the vowel. Normally, forms are shown in headwords with an accent on the vowel to indicate stress and quality, even though when normally written only the final vowel of multi-vowel words has a written accent. Accordingly, when generating the link, accents are stripped from non-final vowels as well as from single-vowel words. To indicate that a single-vowel word has a written accent, add an asterisk (<code>*</code>) ''before'' the form. This preserves the accent in the link and includes a qualifier reading ''with written accent''.

Some single-syllable forms trigger {{w|syntactic gemination}}, while others don't. To indicate that a form triggers syntactic gemination, add an asterisk (<code>*</code>) ''after'' the form. This includes a qualifier reading ''with syntactic gemination''. You can also include a double asterisk (<code>**</code>) after the form to indicate optional syntactic gemination.

An example that uses both of the above indications is {{m|it|dare||to give}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/dò*:*dò*,dièdi:dètti,dàto.sub:dìa.impsub:déssi.imp:dai:da':*dà*}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/dò*:*dò*,dièdi:dètti,dàto.sub:dìa.impsub:déssi.imp:dai:da':*dà*|pagename=dare}}

Note in particular the forms <code>*dò*</code> and <code>*dà*</code>, with asterisks both before the form (to indicate preservation of the written accent) and after the form (to indicate syntactic gemination).

===Verbs whose auxiliary varies===
Many verbs can take either {{m|it|avere}} or {{m|it|essere}} as an auxiliary, often with different meanings. A very common scenario is {{m|it|avere}} when transitive and {{m|it|essere}} when intransitive, e.g. with {{m|it|finire||to end, to finish}}. You can separate multiple auxiliaries with a colon, as with multiple irregular forms, and include qualifiers, which typically you should do to clarify the different usages:
{{temp|it-verb|a[transitive]:e[intransitive]/+isc}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a[transitive]:e[intransitive]/+isc|pagename=finire}}

You can include commas, quotes and other punctuation inside brackets in the qualifier text, e.g. with {{m|it|avanzare}}:
avanzare:
{{temp|it-verb|e[intransitive]:a[transitive, also intransitive meaning "to advance"]/à+}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e[intransitive]:a[transitive, also intransitive meaning "to advance"]/à+|pagename=avanzare}}

You can also include angle brackets (e.g. direct HTML, or HTML produced by a template) or even nested square brackets, as long as they are matching.

===Reflexive verbs===
All reflexive verbs use {{m|it|essere}}, so there is no need to specify the auxiliary and it should be omitted, e.g. for {{m|it|abbandonarsi||to give up, to give in, to surrender}}, use:
:{{temp|it-verb|ó}}
which produces

{{it-verb|ó|pagename=abbandonarsi}}

For root-stressed verbs in ''-ere'', use a backslash with nothing before it, e.g. for {{m|it|accorgersi||to notice, to realize}} (stressed as ''accòrgersi''), use:
:{{temp|it-verb|\ò,accòrsi,accòrto}}
which produces

{{it-verb|\ò,accòrsi,accòrto|pagename=accorgersi}}

If a root-stressed verb in ''-ere'' has an irregular present, specify only the stressed vowel before the backslash, e.g. for {{m|it|togliersi||to get out of the way}}, use:
:{{temp|it-verb|ò\tòlgo,tòlsi,tòlto}}
which produces

{{it-verb|ò\tòlgo,tòlsi,tòlto|pagename=togliersi}}

Note that explicitly specified forms should be given without the reflexive pronoun attached. The only exception is if the imperative is explicitly specified; in that case, include the pronoun, as it is joined to the imperative form and may cause special changes to the form, e.g. {{w|syntactic gemination}}. An example is for {{m|it|farsi||to become, to move (oneself), to buy, etc.}}, with imperative ''fàtti'':
:{{temp|it-verb|fàccio:fò*[archaic or dialectal],féci,fàtto.imperf:facévo.sub:fàccia.imp:fàtti}}
which produces

{{it-verb|fàccio:fò*[archaic or dialectal],féci,fàtto.imperf:facévo.sub:fàccia.imp:fàtti|pagename=farsi}}

===Verbs in ''-rre''===
Verbs in ''-rre'', e.g. {{m|it|trarre||to pull}}, {{m|it|porre||to put}}, {{m|it|dedurre||to deduce}} should use the same backslash notation as with root-stressed verbs in ''-ere'', e.g. for {{m|it|porre}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\ó\póngo,pósi,pósto.imperf:ponévo.fut:porrò}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\ó\póngo,pósi,pósto.imperf:ponévo.fut:porrò}}

For verbs ending in ''-arre'' and ''-urre'' (and ''-irre'' if any such verbs exist), the double-backslash notation can be simplified to a single backslash because the stressed vowel can only be one possibility, e.g. for {{m|it|dedurre}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\dedùco,dedùssi,dedótto.imperf:deducévo}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\dedùco,dedùssi,dedótto.imperf:deducévo|pagename=dedurre}}

Reflexive verbs in ''-arsi'' and ''-ersi'' based off verbs in ''-arre'' and ''-erre'' can also be interpreted as based off of verbs in ''-are'' or ''-ere''; for example, consider {{m|it|contrarsi}}, reflexive of either {{m|it|contrare||to counter (boxing)}} or {{m|it|contrarre||to tense}}. These verbs must use the special indicator <code>rre</code> to indicate that the reflexive is based off of a verb in ''-arre''; otherwise, it will be interpreted as based off of a verb in ''-are''. An example is {{m|it|distrarsi||to be distracted}}, from {{m|it|distrarre||to distract}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|a\distràggo,distràssi,distràtto.imperf:distraévo.imp:distràiti.rre}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a\distràggo,distràssi,distràtto.imperf:distraévo.imp:distràiti.rre|pagename=distrarsi}}

Note in particular the <code>.rre</code> at the end.

===Third-person only verbs===
Some verbs have only third-person forms, either third-person singular only (impersonal) or third-person singular and plural only. Use <code>only3s</code> for the former, and <code>only3sp</code> for the latter. An example of an impersonal verb is {{m|it|bufare||to blizzard}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/ù.only3s}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/ù.only3s|pagename=bufare}}

An example of a third-person only verb (singular and plural) is {{m|it|accadere||to happen}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/à+,accàdde.fut:accadrà.only3sp}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/à+,accàdde.fut:accadrà.only3sp|pagename=accadere}}

As the latter example shows, irregular forms must be specified in the third person.

===Defective verbs===
Some verbs are defective in that they are missing some of their forms. To indicate a missing form, use <code>-</code>. For example, the verb {{m|it|redire||to return}} has no past historic, imperfect, future or imperfect subjunctive. Indicate as follows:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/rièdo,-,redìto.imperf:-.fut:-.impsub:-}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/rièdo,-,redìto.imperf:-.fut:-.impsub:-|pagename=redire}}

If the verb is missing its past participle, use <code>-</code> as normal, but also put a <code>-</code> in place of the auxiliary, because without a past participle no composed tenses can be formed. An example is {{m|it|serpere||to snake}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|-\è,+,-}}
which produces

{{it-verb|-\è,+,-|pagename=serpere}}

===Pronominal verbs===
Pronominal verbs are those verbs that inherently have a clitic pronoun attached to the infinitive. Reflexive verbs, covered above, are a type of pronominal verb; not all pronominal verbs are reflexive. An example that is not is {{m|it|spuntarla||to make it, to succeed}}, composed of {{m|it|spuntare}} + clitic {{m|it|-la}}. Indicate pronominal verbs as normal:
:{{temp|it-verb|a/ù}}
which produces

{{it-verb|a/ù|pagename=spuntarla}}

Note that the clitic is automatically moved before the finite forms.

If the pronominal verb is reflexive, the auxiliary spec will be omitted, as with all reflexive verbs (see [[#Reflexive verbs|above]]). An example is {{m|it|trovarcisi||to find oneself in a happy situation}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|ò}}
which produces

{{it-verb|ò|pagename=trovarcisi}}

note that the two clitics are automatically moved to the front of the finite forms, and {{m|it|-si}} is automatically converted to {{m|it|mi}}.

If the pronominal verb is irregular, don't include any of the clitics in the irregular forms except for the imperative (same as with reflexive verbs). An example is {{m|it|andarsene||to go away, to leave}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|vàdo.fut:andrò.sub:vàda.imp:vàttene}}
which produces

{{it-verb|vàdo.fut:andrò.sub:vàda.imp:vàttene|pagename=andarsene}}

Another example is {{m|it|volerci||to be needed, to be required}}. This is impersonal, hence it uses the spec <code>only3s</code> (see [[#Third-person only verbs|above]]), and requires that all irregular forms be given in the third-person singular:
:{{temp|it-verb|e/vuòle,vòlle.fut:vorrà.sub:vòglia.only3s}}
which produces

{{it-verb|e/vuòle,vòlle.fut:vorrà.sub:vòglia.only3s|pagename=volerci}}

===Multiword expressions===
Multiword expressions such as {{m|it|prestare attenzione||to pay attention}} are supported. To indicate the conjugation of such an expression, place the full verbal spec inside angle brackets (<code><...></code>) directly after the verb to be conjugated:
:{{temp|it-verb|prestare<a/è> attenzione}}
which produces

{{it-verb|prestare<a/è> attenzione}}

Individual portions of the expression, including words other than the verb, are automatically linked. To override this, add explicit links, e.g. for {{m|it|tenere d'occhio||to keep an eye on}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|tenere<a/tèngo,ténni.fut:terrò.imp:tièni> [[d']][[occhio]]}}
which produces

{{it-verb|tenere<a/tèngo,ténni.fut:terrò.imp:tièni> [[d']][[occhio]]}}

This even works if there are multiple verbs in the expression, e.g. {{m|it|trascinare e rilasciare||to [[drag and drop]]}}:
:{{temp|it-verb|trascinare<a/ì> e rilasciare<a/à>}}
which produces

{{it-verb|trascinare<a/ì> e rilasciare<a/à>}}

==Parameters==
The allowed parameters are as follows:

; {{para|1}}
: Specify the inflected forms; see above.
; {{para|head}}, {{para|head2}}, ...
: Override the headword. Useful especially to add unpredictable links in multiword expressions (an automatic linking algorithm applies in the absence of this, and links each word).
; {{para|noautolinktext|1}}
: Disable the autolinking algorithm for text outside of the verb itself, in multiword expressions.
; {{para|noautolinkverb|1}}
: Disable the autolinking algorithm for the verb. If you use both this and {{para|noautolinktext|1}}, no autolinking will happen, with the result that any links need to be specified using {{para|head}} and non-lemma forms will be linked in their entirety.
; {{para|sort}}
: Optional argument to specify the sort key; rarely needed.
; {{para|id}}
: Optional argument to specify a sense ID for linking purposes; see {{temp|senseid}} and {{temp|l}}.
