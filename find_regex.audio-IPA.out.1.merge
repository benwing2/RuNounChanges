{{uses lua|Module:audio}}
This template links to an audio file of spoken language, typically in the "Pronunciation" section of an entry to indicate how a term is pronounced.

To link to an audio file connected to the ''meaning'' of the entry (for example, a recording of a klaxon sound in the {{m|en|klaxon}} entry), use {{tl|listen}}.

==Parameters==
; {{para|1|req=1}}
: The language code (see [[Wiktionary:List of languages]]) for the current language section. <small>The parameter {{para|lang}} is a deprecated synonym; please do not use. If this is used, all numbered parameters move down by one.</small>
; {{para|2|req=1}}
: The name of the audio file.
; {{para|3}}
: The caption to use, in place of "Audio". In most cases, don't override this, but use one of the following parameters instead.
; {{para|q}}
: Specifies a qualifier to be placed before the audio box, after the "Audio" caption. This is formatted with the {{tl|q}}/{{tl|qualifier}} template.
; {{para|a}}
: Specifies one or more comma-separated accent qualifiers to be placed before the audio box, after the "Audio" caption, and are useful for specifying the accent found in the audio file. These are formatted with the {{tl|a}}/{{tl|accent}} template. To be recognized as a separator, there must be no space following the comma; otherwise, the comma is treated as an embedded comma within the accent qualifier.
; {{para|qq}}
: Specifies a qualifier to be placed at the end, after the audio box. Normally, use {{para|q}} instead of this, unless the qualifier is particularly long. This is formatted with the {{tl|q}}/{{tl|qualifier}} template.
; {{para|aa}}
: Specifies one or more comma-separated accent qualifiers to be placed at the end, after the audio box. Normally, use {{para|a}} instead of this, unless the qualifier is particularly long. These are formatted with the {{tl|a}}/{{tl|accent}} template. To be recognized as a separator, there must be no space following the comma; otherwise, the comma is treated as an embedded comma within the accent qualifier.
; {{para|ref}}
: Specifies one or more reference notes to be placed directly after the audio box. The reference is placed in the <code>===References===</code> section at the bottom of the language's entry. See below for the format of this parameter.
; {{para|text}}
: Specifies the text of the audio snippet, if it isn't the same as the term being illustrated. This can be used, for example, when the audio snippet contains extra words in it (e.g. articles).
; {{para|IPA}}
: Specifies the IPA pronunciation of the audio snippet. This can be used, for example, when the audio snippet contains extra words in it, to make it easier to pick out the relevant term. The IPA should be enclosed in brackets or slashes, like the parameters of {{tl|IPA}}.
; {{para|t}}
: Specifies the meaning (gloss) of the text in {{para|text}}, if that text is in a foreign language and its meaning isn't obvious.
; {{para|lit}}
: Specifies the literal meaning of the text in {{para|text}}, if needed.
; {{para|tr}}
: Specifies the manual transliteration of the text in {{para|text}}, for text in non-Latin scripts where either the automatic transliteration isn't correct or there is no automatic transliteration (e.g. in Persian and Hebrew).
; {{para|ts}}
: Specifies the transcription of the text in {{para|text}}, for text in non-Latin scripts where the transliteration is radically different from the actual pronunciation. To be used sparingly and only for certain languages; see the description of this parameter in {{tl|l}} for more information.
; {{para|pos}}
: Specifies the part of speech of the text in {{para|text}}. Included mostly for completeness; rarely needed.
; {{para|nocat|1}}
: Turns off categorization.
; {{para|sort}}
: Manual sortkey. Use sparingly; the {{code|lua|makeSortKey}} method in [[Module:languages]] can usually generate the correct sortkey.
; {{para|bad}}
: To formulate a warning to the reader about quality problems of the audio.

===Examples===
:: The file name should be formatted as ''[language code]-[dialect if any]-[term]''.

==References==
The {{para|ref<var>N</var>}} parameter is used to specify one or more references for a given pronunciation and works similarly to the <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tag. For example, specifying {{para|ref|<nowiki>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</nowiki>}} is similar to placing <code><nowiki><ref>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref></nowiki></code> after the call to {{temp|IPA}}, except that it can be used to insert references directly after a given pronunciation when there are several.

To specify multiple references, separate them with <code> !!! </code> (optionally with spaces around it). For example, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}} !!! {{R:it:Olivetti}}}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref><ref>{{R:it:Olivetti}}</ref></nowiki></code>

To specify the equivalent of the <code><nowiki><ref name="NAME" group="GROUP">...</ref></nowiki></code>, use <code><<name:NAME>></code> and/or <code><<group:GROUP>></code> directly following the reference text. For example, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}<<name:bendo>> !!! {{R:it:Olivetti}}}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref name="bendo">{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref><ref>{{R:it:Olivetti}}</ref></nowiki></code>

Similarly, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}<<name:bendo>><<group:pron>>}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref name="bendo" group="pron">{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref></nowiki></code>

To reference a prior name, as in <code><nowiki><ref name="bendo"/></nowiki></code>, leave the reference text blank:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref=<<name:bendo>>}}</nowiki></code>

Similarly, to reference a prior name in a particular group, as in <code><nowiki><ref name="bendo" group="pron"/></nowiki></code>, use:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref=<<name:bendo>><<group:pron>>}}</nowiki></code>

== [[one x two xs]] ==

I have a question, I have seen entries like this one before for templates for phrases as entries so I gave it a try with one I saw was missing, have I done it right?[[User:Luciferwildcat|Lucifer]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 22:43, 13 April 2012 (UTC)

: No, these have failed RFV/RFD in the past, since they are not used in language this way (with the letter X). Examples were [[X one's Y off]] and [[I'll see you X and raise you Y]]. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 17:25, 14 April 2012 (UTC)
== [[Singlish]] ==

[[w:Singlish]] has an entry saying it's a creole language with no ISO 639 code. Is it really a language, and if it is, what code do we use for it? If it's English-based, it might be {{temp|gmw-sin}} ({{temp|etyl:gmw}} is for West Germanic, and English is West Germanic). [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 15:48, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

: Maybe we could enter it as English with a Singapore gloss. It seems to read more like English than anything else. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 15:51, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:: It's not a creole. WP editors (and linguistically uninformed people generally) have an unfortunate tendency to call any language that shows any sort of influence from an unrelated language a "creole" or a "mixed language" without understanding what those terms actually mean. It's not a separate language either. If we have any "Singlish" forms here, just list them under English and tag them {{temp|Singapore}}. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 22:30, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::That's right, Singlish is an example of code-switching and mixing languages, uneducated English in general. It's similar to [[Chinglish]], [[Engrish]]/[[Japlish]], [[Runglish]], etc. The spread and importance of Singlish is also exaggerated. Yes, Chinese people say "okey lah" (see {{l|cmn|啦|sc=Hani}}) and make grammatical errors but it's not exclusive to Singapore, it's just the influence of people's mother tongue on whatever language they speak. I also don't think it's something that stays unchanged for a significant period. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]])</sup> 23:20, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
== out of context in an attributive sense ==

[[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Fictional_universes]]:

<blockquote>With respect to names of persons or places from fictional universes, they shall not be included unless they are used out of context in an attributive sense, for example:

*'''2004''', Robert Whiting, ''The Meaning of Ichiro: The New Wave from Japan and the Transformation of Our National Pastime'', p. 130:
*:Irabu had hired Nomura, a man with whom he obviously had a great deal in common, and, who, as we have seen, was rapidly becoming the '''Darth Vader''' of Japanese baseball.
*'''1998''', Harriet Goldhor Lerner, ''The Mother Dance: How Children Change Your Life'', p. 159:
*:Steve and I explained the new program to our children, who looked at us as if we had just announced that we were from the planet '''Vulcan'''.
</blockquote>

[[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion#Fictional_universes]] and [[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Fictional_universes]] require fictional names to be cited “out of context in an [[attributive]] sense.” But the terms are not used attributively in the examples. How are we to interpret this guideline? Are the examples incorrect?&nbsp;''—[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2012-04-01&nbsp;17:23&nbsp;z</small>''

:I have myself been under the impression that others had superior knowledge of the meaning of {{term|attributive}} so that the uses above would be included. But I can find no evidence that there is such a generally accepted meaning in any applicable linguistic sense. Quite to the contrary, the contrasting term {{term|predicative}} seems directly applicable to the 2004 example. Accordingly, one or contributors must have been mistaken. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  18:42, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Right, the linguistic interpretation of ''attributive'' does not apply. So it must be the other meaning, "pertaining to or having the character of attribution or an attribute". [[User talk:DAVilla|DAVilla]] 04:19, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I'm skeptical. In the Vulcan quote, there is no “attributive sense” to the term. The children's disbelief is conveyed by a metaphor stemming from the sentence's syntax. And such a generalized sense of “attributive” isn't even given in most dictionaries, so this should be rewritten unambiguously, no matter which way interpret it. Finally, [[Vulcan]] is a not a supporting example, because the “Star Trek planet” sense is absent from Wiktionary.&nbsp;''—[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2012-04-03&nbsp;16:10&nbsp;z</small>''

:::: If CFI is somewhat ambiguous, maybe we do need to have it clarified. Isn't it somewhat disturbing your statement that the example in CFI does not meet CFI? I maintain that the common meaning of ''attributive'' is applicable, and I challenge you to find any dictionary that does not have this meaning. Plus, you should have your eyes checked. We've had the Star Trek planet sense since the very day the page was created. [[User talk:DAVilla|DAVilla]] 18:11, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

::I think with this policy, something like "Joker laugh", you probably won't understand what this means unless you know who Joker from the Batman franchise is. I'm ok with it so far. But if I hear a song on the radio and someone says "this has a 90s sound to it", we can't really add to [[90s]] a definition to cover what music was like in the 90s. At some point, popular culture information has to go on Wikipedia. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 15:53, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Yes. The policy should help unwind the difficult exercise of excluding specific references, but including terms with inherent meaning (which may, confusingly, originate in specific references). The current unclear writing just muddies the water. As a result, we don't even know what the policy is, and interpret it in contrary ways.

:We have two votes about changing the CFI language on brand names?  Two votes which are simply different proposals, without respect to each other?  Well, it's a good thing we're solving these issues with votes, which are conducive to compromise and change, as opposed to something silly like discussions.  Also, if anyone would like to change the status quo on the necessity to have a vote over changing a comma into a semi-colon on ELE, there's a vote for that too.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 22:43, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
:: The two votes on brand names were quickly started, and have created not much of overhead and endless discussion. Those who wanted to discuss could do so on the talk pages of the votes, and they did, indeed. I think I and Liliana should be applauded for creating these two votes. We are getting things done. I now even think that Liliana was right to let the other vote start mere week after the start of the first vote. It's a pity that there are so many vote-haters in Wiktionary. Furthermore, the extension of the regulation of brand names to non-physical products has been discussed countless times in WT:RFV, so a lot of discussion actually already took place long before the votes were created. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 15:58, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::To be clear, I don't hate votes, but I guess my philosophy on their purpose differs from others.  I've always thought that votes were meant to be a documentation of previously established consensus.  Essentially, that votes shouldn't be started until it's patently obvious which way they'll go.  They shouldn't require further discussion because the discussion has been more or less fully resolved.  I'll take your word for it that there was a fair amount of discussion on the topics beforehand.  However, there were clearly subtopics which weren't discussed, or weren't discussed properly beforehand, as evidenced by the talk pages of those votes.  In any case, I'm not disparaging the vote creators, whom I will concede are getting things done.  Rather, I'm disparaging the current methodology of getting things done, which I view as extremely inefficient.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 23:11, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== First-person Singular Imperative of Portuguese Verbs ==

An anon complained at [[Talk:cantar]] that there’s no 1st person singular imperative in Portuguese, and as far as I’m aware he is correct. If you look at [[fazer]], our conjugation includes the 1st person singular imperative (affirmative and negative). Note the following links:
* ([http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperativo pt:wp]) “No imperativo, não existe a primeira pessoa do singular (eu)” (For the imperative, there is no first person singular (I)).
* ([http://pt.wiktionary.org/wiki/fazer pt:wt]) No 1st person singular imperative (open the dropdown under the header '''Conjugação'''. 1st person singular is the first column, imperatives are the 10th and 11th rows).
* ([http://www.dicio.com.br/fazer/ Online dictionary 1]) ditto (under the header '''Imperativo''', notice how it has 5 items, while the other moods have 6)
* ([http://www.conjuga-me.net/verbo-fazer Online dictionary 2]) ditto (1st person singular imperatives marked with a dash).

It is my opinion that the 1st person singular imperative should be removed from the Portuguese conjugation table ({{temp|pt-conj/theTable}}). Is anyone opposed to this?  <small>[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]]</small> 12:12, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:The 1st person singular imperatives are traditionally absent from conjugation tables, yet they are largely attestable. Don't you agree?
:"Bendito seja eu por tudo o que não sei" (Fernando Pessoa)
:See also Prof. Evanildo Bechara's grammar book ''Moderna Gramática Portuguesa'', where they do appear in conjugation tables. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel]] 12:36, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::I don't think so. But, how do you think that would happen? If you have an explanation, please let me know. I didn't check the sources you listed.
:::The thesis that it is just referring to oneself in the third-person does not seem to explain how the verb "saber" [[w:Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with the personal pronoun without further adaptations.

:::* Bendito seja eu por tudo o que não sei.
:::* Bendito sejas tu por tudo o que não sabes.
:::* Bendito seja ele por tudo o que não sabe.

:::::* Bendito seja eu por tudo o que não sabem.
:::::Is that correct? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel]] 13:12, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Pardon my cluelessness — I don't speak Portuguese — but in the Pessoa quotation, isn't {{m|pt|seja}} the subjunctive, rather than the imperative? The speaker is not commanding himself to be blessed — it's not as though he could comply with the commandment ''by'' being blessed — but rather, he's calling down a blessing on himself.

:::: Well, again, I don't speak Portuguese; but in both French and Spanish, this is exactly the sort of situation where the subjunctive can be used without "que". For example, in French you can say either {{google|"béni sois-je"|« béni sois-je »}} or {{google|"que je sois béni"|« que je sois béni »}}, and in Spanish either {{google|"bendito sea yo"|}} or {{google|"que yo sea bendito"|}}.

#* '''1977''', Evanildo Bechara, ''Moderna Gramática Portuguesa'', 22nd edition, Companhia Editora Nacional, page 116:
#*: O imperativo em português só tem formas apenas para as segundas pessoas; as pessoas que faltam são supridas pelos correspondentes do presente subjuntivo. '''Não se usa o imperativo de 1.ª pessoa do singular'''. As terceiras pessoas do imperativo se referem a ''você'', ''vocês'' e não a ''eles''. Também não se usa o imperativo nas orações negativas; neste caso empregam-se as formas correspondentes do presente do subjuntivo.
#*:: The imperative in Portuguese only has forms for the second-persons; the missing persons are supplied by the correspondents of the present subjunctive. '''The 1st person singular of the imperative is not used'''. The third persons of the imperative refer to ''[[você]]'', ''[[vocês]]'' and not to ''[[eles]]''. The imperative is also not used in negative clauses; in this case the correspondent forms of the present subjunctive are employed.
Following this paragraph, there is a table with the conjugation of the affirmative and negative imperatives of the verb [[cantar]], and in both of them the first person singular is marked with a dash. I also skimmed quickly through some pages to find conjugation tables; in every one I found (pages 129, 133, 136, 144), 1st person singular imperative was missing.

Maybe this changed in subsequent editions, but if it didn’t I’d say this is evidence enough for the removal of the 1st person singular imperative from the Portuguese conjugation table.

Also, hats off to Ruakh, who was right about it being subjunctive. <small>[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]]</small> 23:41, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

: If you do want to remove it from conjugation tables (which sounds reasonable to me), then I think you should do that by modifying {{temp|pt-conj/doWork}} or {{temp|pt-conj/doWork/add}} rather than {{temp|pt-conj/theTable}}: the latter happily lets the first-person-singular-imperatives have some sort of indication of non-existence (such as an em dash or a blank space), as long as parameters #69 and #75 are set properly. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:29, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
:: I’ve only recently started attempting to write templates (and it’s not working very well yet :-(  ). Whichever way it’s removed, it should be done so that in case it ever turns out we were wrong, it should be easy to fix. But it’s better to wait and see what Daniel and other contributors have to say, before changing such a widely used template. <small>[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]]</small> 00:50, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

== Requesting input for extinct and other sparsely documented languages ==

Thanks to the great feedback provided, the proposal for [[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-03/CFI_for_Endangered_Languages|endangered languages]] CFI needs to be reworded and is essentially stopped. (Do I need to somehow terminate it?) 

1. Although I have asked twice for clarification of the [[Wiktionary:CFI#Attestation|CFI for extinct languages]], however, I haven't gotten any feedback on that. It currently reads: "For terms in extinct languages: usage in at least one contemporaneous source."

One of the criticisms of my proposed vote was the word "usage" instead of "mention." But the CFI for extinct languages also uses the word "usage." Also, the word "contemporaneous" is used. I'm not sure why it's worded like that.

My current thought is to propose that all sparsely documented languages (including extinct and most endangered languages) have a criterion such as this: "Contextually appropriate usage or mention in at least one source." 

That will allow for quoting scholars who are not contemporaneous with the language when it was alive.

2. I think that the wording in 1 will provide room for abuse, however. With only one usage or mention, somebody can just upload to Usenet a hastily typed document with lots of errors and proclaim it to be a valid source, forcing inappropriate words onto Wiktionary. I therefore want to provide a mechanism to provide balance and curb abuse of that criterion. My line of thinking is something like this: "Each sparsely documented language will maintain a '''page''' that provides space for discussing whether sources are appropriate."

That '''page''' can be the About page or a completely separate page; additionally, people can bring it to the Wiktionary community at large and call a vote, though hopefully that will not be necessary.

Any comments and feedback are greatly appreciated. [[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BenjaminBarrett12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 23:38, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:Reading the comments, I suspect that the final product should probably treat the various groups (extinct, endangered, poorly documented) separately, as a number of the oppose/abstain votes took issue with lumping them together.  The notion of allowing each language to essentially define its own criteria on its 'About' page is a very robust approach, which, in an ideal world would probably be best.  However, I suspect that many editors will be uneasy with the inherent ambiguity of such an approach.  Personally, I'm not entirely certain how I feel about it.  Regarding use/mention, it should probably be noted that Ancient Greek is already allowing mentions.  {{m|grc|θεπτάνων}} is a mention only term.  It is never used in an ancient context, but is merely mentioned and defined by the ancient dictionary written by [[w:Hesychius]].  If we restricted ourselves to use, there may well be justification for that, but we should realize the consequences of doing so, namely that we will never have important, and almost certainly real, words in our dictionary that others will have.  Of course, a compromise approach would be 'use only' with notable exceptions when appropriate, which would solve the problem for {{m|grc|θεπτάνων}} at least.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 00:39, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Thank you for the feedback. The issue of doing extinct languages separately is one of the reasons I'm asking about the current policy: I just don't see why extinct languages should be restricted to contemporaneous usage only when the other groups would not be, or what makes extinct languages so unique. (Also, there is a lot of fuzzy overlap between endangered and extinct languages that makes it difficult to separate them.)

:::Can we also consider languages, which are NOT endangered but English language resources are limited, multiple transliteration methods exist and our contents in these languages are very scarce? For example, Sinhalese resources in English are almost non-existent, si wiki is nearly dead and very few here would be able to say about what transliteration methods would be right? Yes, having "just one source" for endangered languages sounds right and the source may not be on the web but from a book.

== Numbered translation glosses ==

Do we want to have numbered translation glosses, such as those introduced in {{diff|16156937|text=this edit of "break" from 23:35, 23 January 2012}}, curiously summaried as "checked fi"?

::I agree! [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 23:02, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
:::I think that the current system is a chaos as well. People editing the English definitions seem to pay no attention whatsoever to the translations. I have many times encountered translation tables for senses that have been deleted or merged a long time ago or others in which the translation gloss just vaguely resembles the corresponding definition. However, my original plan was not to start a new practice. My intention was to use the numbers during the editing phase to keep track on which translation refers to which definition, but obviously I forgot to remove the numbers. Sorry for that. --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 20:08, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Are there cleanup approaches that would get at the problem? The problem is, after all, limited to polysemic PoSes in English entries. One thing might be to match the count of trans-tables to the count of senses (excluding &lit senses) for polysemic English PoSes. Another might be to list each trans-gloss that does not consist of (meaningful) words that are in a sense including any context-type labels. Polysemic PoSes can also have problems with synonyms. This is in principle doable with dump processing. Once we have cleaned up the backlog, it could be left to a bot to track changes. Perhaps the closers of RfDs and RfVs and other contributors could leave a special template if the sense content changes and they do not make corresponding changes in the glosses.

:I'm also annoyed with people ignoring translations when changing definitions at times. Please understand, it takes time and effort to add translations. Don't just change definitions and trans glosses lightly. People who made valid translations may not come back. Also, frustrated when translations are converted into "to be checked" sections. I know it's hard but perhaps this could be avoided if definitions and translations are in synch and when the most common or intuitive definition of a term comes first (before any additional senses), the most common translation will also come into the first gloss. Endless splitting may also be counterproductive, like with [[pass#Verb]]. There are so many definitions but I struggle to find the sense, which applies to "pass the time" (or maybe it's missing?). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]])</sup> 02:27, 11 April 2012 (UTC)
::Having numbers in translation tables might not be so bad after all, especially for entries which have a large number of definitions. Take [[break]] as an example. We have currently 27 definitions and 31 translation tables. Why? Because, for definition #1 there are four translation tables and for definition 23 there are two. There is potential for another two tables as definition # 23 has three subdefinitions and somebody might want to create a table for the sense that is common for all subsenses. This is really time-consuming for omeone who would want to either find or edit translations. Also, when doing the actual editing, it is not easy to locate the correct one among 31 options in a set of 27. I admit that the numbers might sometimes refer to a wrong definition, but if there would be the number <u>and</u> the gloss, the numbering would at least make it easier to detect an eventual mess and fix it. Either way, the current model of separating definitions and translations in separate lists is apt to cause confusion.

== Normalised spellings of ancient languages ==

There are some ancient languages, that are commonly written in normalised spelling. This means that the spelling is brought into a common form, which may not be the form that is actually attested in writing. One such language is Old Norse. A word such as {{m|non|kvelja}} might have actually been spelled <qvelia> in the original document, and {{m|non|ek}} is more usually written <ec>. Similar normalisations are also commonly applied to other Germanic languages. It seems to me that such normalised forms are definitely useful (even moreso than the spellings of the original document), but they technically don't meet CFI because they are not actually attested. I am wondering what kind of consensus or policy exists on this practice so far. Personally I think they should be allowed for any language with no consistent spelling system, provided the normalisation scheme is explained somewhere. And of course I'm not suggesting that the spellings of the manuscripts themselves can not be added, too (maybe as alternative forms pointing to the normalised spellings). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 19:32, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

: I would consider any publication of a work valid for attestation; I see no reason that you can't cite Oxford's Anthology of Old Norse, e.g., for a spelling. I would consider them far more useful then the manuscript spellings, as there's probably hundreds of copies of such anthologies for each copy in the original spelling.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 22:32, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

:::If it's relevant, miniscules (lowercase letters) and accents were all invented well after nearly all the important Ancient Greek works, yet all of our Ancient Greek words make use of them.  It's a scholarly standard.  The point is, Ancient Greek on Wiktionary has fairly specific orthography standards (with a few grey areas), and as it happens, every other Wiktionary seems to be following identicalish standards, as evidenced by the existence of interwikis.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 23:00, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: That does clear up some things but I do still have questions. When it comes to normalisation of ancient Germanic languages, there are different standards (if you can call them that). Those standards don't usually conflict, it's more a matter of how much normalisation they apply. For example, one source might normalise i to j where appropriate, another might normalise uu to w and u to v where appropriate, another might normalise c to k, yet another might also normalise qu to kw, some might also apply morphological standardisation, and different sources might apply different combinations of these normalisations. It would be hard for us to show all combinations, and it still leaves open the question of which scheme Wiktionary itself standardises on (for consistency and clarity if nothing else). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:00, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

:<small>rambling thoughts on the matter:</small> When a portion of a work (not just one word) is printed in two (or one, or three, etc) editions using different normalised spellings, I consider both printings to contain CFI-satisfying uses of whatever spellings they contain, in the same way one printing of the Bible using [[[[vnto]]]] can be used to cite [[[[vnto]]]], and another using [[[[unto]]]] can be used to cite [[[[unto]]]] (even though they're not independent, etc etc), so I'd allow all attested normalisations. I'd also consider original manuscripts and facsimiles ''there''of to contain CFI-satisfying uses of words, so I believe we should always ''allow'' manuscript ''spellings'' to have entries (which can soft-redirect to the normalised spellings). I would still normalise upper- vs lower-case, i.e. have an entry at [[[[en]]]] even if manuscripts have [[[[En]]]] or [[[[eN]]]], because our search function and see-{{temp|also}}s handle case differences but not spelling differences, and because it is our longstanding, fundamental policy to have entries for different spellings ([[[[colour]]]], [[[[color]]]]) but not different capitalisations ([[[[COLOUR]]]], [[[[Color]]]]). As for which normalisation to standardise on: I suppose the editors of each language can decide that amongst themselves, just like the editors of various languages can decide on systems of romanisation.

::: I like what you've written at [[WT:AOSX]] and [[WT:AGOH]], though I have two questions about the specific normalisation schemes: I presume the note that 'u, uu'='w' applies only when 'u' is consonantal, so 'ubar' is not 'wber' <tt>;)</tt> &mdash; and why normalise 'u, uu' to 'w', but 'kw' to 'qu'? Shouldn't it be either 'u + qu' or 'w + kw'? I'm looking into [[WT:ANON]] now.
::: PS: I wonder if we should have a dedicated template for manuscript spellings, like {{temp|manuscript spelling of}}, displaying "Manuscript spelling of _" or "Alternative spelling of_, used in [some manuscripts]" (the last part could even allow specific manuscripts(s) to be named as parameter(s)). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 18:03, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: I'm not sure about normalising qu to kw. My reasoning is mostly that while modern German has normalised c and uu, it still retains qu in its modern spelling (although Dutch does not). Furthermore, Middle Dutch is commonly cited with qu intact as well. So it seemed more consistent to leave it like that in the Old languages as well. And yes I do think a special template would be nice. But I would suggest {{temp|unnormalized spelling of}}, so that it's immediately clear what the relationship is (as well as the fact that normalisation has been applied in the first place). However, this may be confusing if both the unnormalised and normalised spellings occur in the actual documents, such as Old Saxon terms spelled with either v or ƀ. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:09, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
::::I'm in strong favour of a template which denominates unnormalised spelling. I also think that normalisation should only include native phonemes. Thus, I would eradicate ''qu'' from it because, in Germanic languages, neither do ''kw'' and ''qu'' contrast, nor is there a /q/ phoneme, nor is /u/ part of <qu>. Also, for Old Saxon in specific, I'd like to rediscuss <v>, which indicates /v/, where [β] was used. Which makes me ask: Are you intending this to be guidelines which are followed due to politeness or would it lead to votes turning them policies?[[User:Korn|Korn]] ([[User talk:Korn|talk]]) 18:28, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: It seems to me that that goes further than the intended purpose of normalisation. Normalisation is not the same as completely respelling the words to be phonemic. It's meant only to standardise on spelling variations for ease of use, and to introduce modern distinctions between letters that were not known to ancient writers (mostly concerning I and U). A 'common denominator' spelling if you will. I'm not sure about the exact pronunciation of /v/ in Old Saxon. In Germanic it was indeed [β], and presumably it remained bilabial until after Old Saxon and Old High German split, because OHG has [b]. But in Old Saxon texts, in words with Germanic *b, some writers use ƀ while others use v. Old Dutch and Old Frisian texts use v exclusively, while OHG texts write mostly b, and Old Norse and Old English write only f. On the other hand, in later Old Dutch and also High and Low German, the letter v starts to be used to represent *f as well, showing initial and medial voicing of voiceless fricatives.
::::: And no I'm not intending this to be a formal policy, I'm only hoping to establish some kind of common practice, and to have it in writing that normalisations are... well, the norm on Wiktionary. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:44, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::Do you intend {{temp|normalised spelling}} as a context template? (Main entries need no form-of templates.) If so, what do we do when the normalised spelling is also attested, include {{temp|attested spelling of}} on one line and {{temp|normalised spelling}} on the next, or use {{temp|context|attested and normalised spelling}}? I would prefer we leave normalised entries unmarked: we needn't mark them as attested when they ''are'' also attested, just as we needn't mark "[[bird#English|bird]]" as referring to a feathered-wing-having, egg-laying animal in the New York dialect, because it refers to the same thing in most other dialects of English... and we needn't mark them as normalised, lest we wrongly imply they aren't attested when they are. (But I understand the value of noting which spellings are attested and which are normalised, so I might could be persuaded to support such templates and context tags as an obvious way of presenting such information, though usage notes might be better.)
::::::Another idea for the manuscript spellings: (e.g. for [[[[ec]]]]:) <nowiki># {{context|in the Codex Regius}} {{alternative spelling of|ek}}</nowiki>.

So I would propose two tags {{temp|normalised (spelling)}} and {{temp|historic (spelling)}} (which would not collide with archaic/obsolite since those are reserved for living languages). Historic would, when not accompanied by ''normalised'' then be followed by sth. like ''see [normalised form]]''. I'm not fond of ''alternative spelling'' because historical spellings are no alternative to normalised spellings an modern-academic context and normalised spellings were not applied by native writers.

== A separate category tree for forms ==

A few weeks ago, someone suggested at [[WT:ID#Category of all forms]] to create a separate category tree for non-lemmas. I do see some merit in the suggestion, as it would make it a bit easier for editors and users alike to keep lemmas and non-lemmas apart. On the other hand, it isn't always clear what is a lemma and what isn't. Participles are a notorious example. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:17, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

: But "non-lemma" is not a coherent concept, is it? I mean, what does it say about a word that it's not a lemma? —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 20:34, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
:: Supposedly, lemmas may be created through derivation, whereas non-lemmas are created through inflection. If something is not a lemma on Wiktionary it means we don't have a self-sufficient definition for the term, but rather link to another term which has the proper definition. Conjugated verb forms and declined forms of nominals would be examples. Participles, verbal nouns and degrees of comparison are a bit of a grey area, as they may have definitions in some languages (such as in Latin) but not in others (English), and often have secondary senses not readily derivable from their status as inflected forms, so that they can be considered both lemmas and non-lemmas at the same time. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:16, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
::: That distinction doesn't hold up.  The Romance language verb forms (non-lemmata) ''derive'' from Latin verb forms.  The choice of the lemma for a word is actually arbitrary, as the plurals and gendered forms of words usually derive from a corresponding form in the parent language.  Wiktionary, like other dictionaries, simply chooses one of the various forms to be place-holder for the word in all forms, and that choice, although conventionally consistent, is nonetheless arbitrary. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 22:01, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: Of course it is arbitrary, but since categories on Wiktionary are also arbitrary, there is no harm in allowing our categories to reflect our own internal treatment of terms. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:11, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: To what benefit?  Non-lemmata may or may not have definitions, and may or may not have translations, and ''should'' have quotations and pronunciations.  So what difference warrants a separate category structure beyond the purely arbitrary designation of some entries as non-lemmata? --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 02:57, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::I've been putting all the non-lemmata in 'non-lemmata' categories for Ancient Greek.  My reasoning is that, once we actually get a substantial number of inflected form entries, keeping noun forms in [[:Category:Ancient Greek noun forms]] helps keep [[:Category:Ancient Greek nouns]] useable.  However, as I look at it, I see that [[:Category:Ancient Greek noun forms]] is in [[:Category:Noun forms by language]], so I guess I'm not entirely certain what's being proposed here.  There is some grey area as to what is and is not a lemma entry.  We have some "lemma" entries for the comparative forms of adjectives (e.g. [[πρεσβύτερος]]), and I've seen them for plurals too, but I don't know if that derails the whole notion of making a distinction between the two.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 11:35, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::: This proposal doesn't intend to solve or change the definition of what we consider lemmas or not.

The ambiguity is only in deciding what to do with categories like [[:Category:Latin participles]] and [[:Category:Latin adjective comparative forms]], since it's not clear in which of the two category trees they belong. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 12:28, 9 April 2012 (UTC)

:: I think that's not the point Equinox is trying to make. He says that such words are slang or jargon when used in English, but when used in Scots they are just everyday words.

:::Fine, but the Wiktionary article purports to be about Scots terms per se, i.e. ''as used in Scotland'', not about Scots words (of which there are very few) that are used in English outwith Scotland.

When the Scottish Parliament released a version of their website in Scots a few years ago I remember it being passed round in forwarded emails among Scottish friends of mine as though it was the funniest thing ever – like a UK Parliament site in Cockney. This is changing now though, as Scottish schools have to include Scots classes and many publishers are bringing out more serious books in the language.

As Atalaes said: BP and other high-volume pages ''do'' need a new format.
But LT doesn't seem to have many friends here.

Therefore, I suggest sub-pages like the deletion log of the Italian WP. Example: [[:w:it:Wikipedia:Pagine da cancellare/Log/2008 giugno 13]].
One could create a sub-page for each new discussion, or a sub-page for each new month.
These sub-pages could be added to your normal watchlist, and without flooding your watchlist with the high-volume Beer Parlour (or similar pages).
After a certain time, one could unlink the sub-pages and link them to some archive index page.
The editing and the discussions wouldn't find place in the BP or Tea Room any more, but in their sub-pages; BP and TR would be just a list of included sub-pages.

This would also solve the problem of retrieving old discussions. Currentliy, moving discussions to an archive page kills all links and you'll have to search the archives.

In this solution, the user should be offered a link to click on, which starts some kind of Javascript, maybe similar to the New Entry Creator by Yair rand.
It should prompt the user for a discussion title and the discussion text, like when you add a new section to a discussion page.
The discussion title should be the base of the sub-page name.
The Javascript adds the name of the parent page to the title and could prepend the current date, so sub-pages don't conflict with each other. For example: "Beer Parlour/2012-04-11 Newbie question", "Tea Room/2012-04-12 Another queston" etc.
The sub-pages should contain their own edit-links (like in WT:VOTE).
Users shouldn't be able to edit the parent page (Beer Parlour, Tee Room, Ety Scriptorium etc) in a direct way; it would be the Javascript that links or inserts the newly created sub-page into the parent page.<br>

::Note that [[WT:ES]] has an odd (and thus frequently-circumvented/ignored) format already.

== Moving 'pronunciation' down in ELE ==

I think it would be nice to make pronunciation one of the last sections of an entry, thereby promoting definitions. An example of an entry with long pronunciation section (much longer than its etymology section) is [[contract]]. Demoting (moving down) pronunciation should be much easier than demoting etymologies, as there are fairly many entries with multiple etymologies, and Wiktionary's entry structure makes part-of-speech headings depend on etymology headings. I know that some entries have several pronunciations, which might cause a problem, yet [[contract]] entry shows how several pronunciations, differentiated by part of speech, can be entered into one pronunciation section. Whatever the case, I think this proposal should be given some serious thought. If you know of a past discussion on the subject, please post a link to it. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:40, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

::I agree with Liliana. People expect pronunciation info at the top of an entry. Also, homographs are very often also homophones (especially in languages with better regulated spelling systems than English), so in some cases a single pronunciation can be given for a single spelling, even when multiple etymologies are listed. (See for example [[fundo#Portuguese]].) —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 11:45, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

: For the record, I have renamed the section heading of this thread to make it clearer.
: I've always thought definitions are the most important content in a dictionary. While dictionaries often do list pronunciation first, their pronunciation information takes one line rather than several; see how compact the pronunciation information is at http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/cat or at http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/cat. Furthermore, many dictionaries do not show pronunciation at all (including Merriam-Webster online), which suggests pronunciation is less important than definitions, especially to native speakers. Some online dictionaries have etymology ''below'' definitions, including Merriam-Webster, Collins and AHD. Thus, I am surprised by the responses above. I admit that I have no data on what content users of Wiktionary search most often, whether definitions, pronunciation or etymologies. What I do know is that Wiktionary has 31,445 entries with "etymology" section (found using AWB, searching for "==\s*Etymology"), and that it has 30,875 entries with "pronunciation" section (found using AWB, searching for "==\s*Pronunciation"). Thus, whatever people are searching for on Wiktionary, what they actually find are above all definitions rather then pronunciation and etymologies. On the sample of one consisting of me, definitions are content number one. The interface to Wiktionary [http://ninjawords.com/ ninjawords] only shows definitions, suggesting some other people deem definitions the most important thing. I recall DCDuring wanting to promote definitions. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 06:50, 13 April 2012 (UTC)

== Moving 'alternative forms' down in ELE ==

[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-03/Moving "Coordinate terms" up in ELE]] proposes this ordering of terms:

*'''Alternative forms'''
...
*'''Synonyms'''
*'''Antonyms'''
*''Other allowable -nyms''
*'''Coordinate terms'''
*'''Derived terms'''
*'''Related terms'''
*'''Translations'''
*'''Descendants'''

But we still list 'alternative forms' at the top of entries. To me it makes more sense to list it along with other terms that are related in some way to the current term. So I would like to propose modifying it to this:

*'''Alternative forms'''
*'''Synonyms'''
*'''Antonyms'''
*''Other allowable -nyms''
*'''Coordinate terms'''
*'''Derived terms'''
*'''Related terms'''
*'''Translations'''
*'''Descendants'''

Seen as the terms are listed in a general order from 'most closely related semantically' to 'least closely related semantically', the alternative forms section seems 'closer' even than synonyms, so I've placed it above it. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 12:22, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

== Renaming “context labels” ==

I'd like to reform the vocabulary surrounding our “context labels.”

{{temp|context}} is used for two different things: ''grammatical labels'' and ''usage labels'' (also called ''restricted-usage labels'').

The use of the term ''context'' is incorrect and misleading. Newb editors often think the label is supposed to represent the context of the referent (labelling [[cow]] with “''animals''”), or even that it's just something vaguely placed in the context of the entry's definition line. But the term [[context]], in corpus-based lexicography, properly refers to something different: a term's context of usage, shown in a quotation. The generic sense of ''context'' can be applied to usage labels, but in several different ways, mostly incorrect. And context has nothing to do with our so-called “grammatical context labels.”

I'd like to rename the the mechanics of these templates from ''context'' to ''label'', and sort them out functionally into ''grammatical labels'' and ''usage labels''. This relates directly to the terminology of professional lexicography (for example, s.v. “[http://books.google.ca/books?id=E67tEcfQCwoC&lpg=PA80&vq=label&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q=label&f=false label]” in Hartmann, ''Dictionary of Lexicography'').

Things that would be updated:

* {{temp|context}} → {{temp|label}}
* [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained#Context labels]]
* [[Wiktionary:Context labels]]
* [[:Category:Context labels]] → [[:Category:grammatical labels]] and [[:Category:usage labels]]

:::: Hartmann classifies various axes of usage labels, although he warns that there are no clear boundary lines: period (e.g., ''archaic/in vogue''), attitude (''appreciative/derogatory''), frequency (''basic/rare''), contact (''borrowing/vernacular''), channel (''written/spoken''), standard (''correct/incorrect''), register (''elevated/intimate''), social status (''high/demotic''), subject (''Botany''), genre (''poetic/conversational''), dialect (''American'').

== Deleting [[Template:languagex]] ==

I nominated this template for deletion [[WT:RFDO#Template:languagex]]. But the reason why it exists is because some of our language templates have prefixes and this template is designed to handle those. It has always been a bit of a strange system and slightly misguided in my opinion, so I'd like to discuss removing those prefixes. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 12:22, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

==Regarding Georgian verbs ==
Well, because I received so many replies saying [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion/Others#Template:ka-verb "Oh yeah, of course", "OMG why didnt we discuss that before?", etc.] I have decided to move discussion into here to talk in depth :D.
OK, if, here too, I got no replies, I would:
# establish, I understand how strange it may sound, 8 forms of third-person present (or sometimes future) and verbal nouns as lemmas, this means we will have to define at most 9 forms. 
::GED has the same rule (in fact I'm talking about GED's rules :D)
::one of the main reasons why we should not use only a verbal noun as a lemma is that not all verbs have a verbal noun. another is that verbal nouns don't express any features of Georgian verbs except aspect and the meaning :D
::similarly, I use future tense because not all verbs have a present form.
::Choosing a verb form as a lemma eases by many aspects, for example sometimes it is too artificial to transform a common Georgian proverb (verbal part of which is verb form) into a proverb with a verbal noun in it.
# create ka-verbal _noun
# create ka-verb_link and link all possible lemmas from a verbal noun article.
# make use of ka-verb for lemmas, but as opposed to la-verb, ka-verb will also add //category:verb form//

In a nutshell,  I'll copy the contents from GED first :D (preserving even the way of defining). While copying (:D) I/we may encounter a problem (less probable though) or a better way may strike on our heads, but that wouldn't be a problem (using our lovely bots :D).

==Featured entries==

As [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3Ah%C3%A1%C4%8Dek&diff=16696298&oldid=16369481 I wrote] in [[Talk:háček#Featured entry?]]:<br/>With ninety-five supporting quotations for its various forms, {{m|en|háček}} is very probably this project's best-attested lexeme. I've never seen an entry with pronunciatory transcriptions for as many accents and/or speech standards, as many attested synonyms, or as many supporting references. It has a full etymology, going back to Proto forms, and includes parallel formations and cognates; moreover, it has fourteen attested variant spellings, an illustrative image, three derived terms, two lists of coördinate terms, translations into twenty-one languages, two external links, and a fair few exegetic notes. Unlike Wikipedia, we don't have "featured articles" (though our equivalents here would be "featured ''entries''"), but I think we should, because this would allow us to draw attention to our lexicographically best entries, which would in turn function as ''beaux idéals'' to inspire more entries of such calibre.<br/>So, what do y'all say? Should we have featured entries? and does {{term||háček}} make the grade? — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 22:33, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

By contrast, the criterion I have in mind for an entry's selection as a featured entry is "completeness". Besides more translations, I can't really think of anything ''left'' that could be added to our English entry for {{term||háček}}; that's why I think it should be a featured entry. — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 16:45, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

:The French Wiktionary tried tagging "entries of quality", but the project ground rapidly to a halt.  We don't have the kind of group efforts going into entries that Wikipedia has, in part because of our extremely small regularly contributing staff, each member of which has a particular sphere of knowledge that often does not overlap with others.  We also run into the issue of whether non-English entries could qualify, and then it becomes a swamping effort in a few languages, with no qualified editors to review the nominations.  What I did try to start was a "model entries" effort, but that was designed to include a very small number of words to act as models, which meant that they needed to meet certain ''a priori'' criteria, such as few PoS sections, breadth of translatability, simplicity and universality of the senses defined, etc.  Many excellent entries on Wiktionary would not be useful as models because of the entry's overwhelming complexity.  We;ve discussed the idea of "featured" entries before, and I still haven't heard a viable proposal that makes sense to bother trying.  Unlike Wikipedia, we can't feature an "intertesting" toppic; we'd be featuring thorough dictionary entries, which do not lend themselves to casual reading. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 06:21, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

== Requiring entries to use e.g. <tt>{{[[Template:context|context]]|medicine}}</tt> instead of e.g. <tt>{{[[Template:medicine|medicine]]}}</tt> ==

Discussions at [[Wiktionary:Grease pit]] have led some editors to suggest that we require entries to use e.g. {{temp|context|medicine}} rather than e.g. {{temp|medicine}}.

Some reasons for this suggestion:

* Some editors feel that part of the complexity of {{temp|context}}'s implementation is due to support for entries' using {{temp|medicine}} directly. (I don't really agree with this view, personally, but it seems to have been the original motivation for the suggestion, hence my mentioning it.)
* This would allow sense labels to be searchable. Right now {{argwiktlink|link=Special:Search?search=slang+forgetful&ns0=1|disp=a Wiktionary search for "slang" + "forgetful"}} won't find [[[[spacer]]]], because that entry uses {{temp|slang}} directly; but it ''would'' find it if the entry used {{temp|context|slang}} instead.
* Currently, we have some inconsistency in that {{temp|context|medicine}} and {{temp|medicine}} are equivalent but {{temp|context|law}} and {{temp|law}} are not (because the latter is a language template rather than a context template), and {{temp|context|obstetrics}} and {{temp|obstetrics}} are not (because the latter doesn't exist).
* There are some downsides to the fact that {{temp|context|medicine}} invokes {{temp|medicine}} rather than (say) {{temp|context/medicine}}; for example, the existence of {{temp|law}} as a language template means that {{temp|context|law}} can't be used for legal entries (we've had to require that {{temp|context|legal}} be used instead; {{temp|law}} can't even be a redirect).
** Technically this is a somewhat separate issue, in that forbidding {{temp|medicine}} from being called directly is not equivalent to having {{temp|context}} call {{temp|context/medicine}}; and indeed, the downsides that I mentioned could be addressed by having {{temp|context|medicine}} invoke {{temp|context/medicine}} while keeping {{temp|medicine}} as syntactic sugar for {{temp|context|medicine}}; but some editors seem to be opposed to the idea of having two templates for every sense label.
* This would make it easier for consumers of our content (mirrors, applications, and whatnot) to recognize sense labels.
* This would make it easier for bots to recognize sense labels. (For example, a bot that recognizes {{temp|context|...}} in non-English sections and adds <tt>lang=xx</tt> would no longer have to search for and recognize every single context template.)
* This would arguably be more sensible when multiple unrelated sense labels appear together; for example, if you think about it, it's rather bizarre to combine {{temp|rare}} and {{temp|medicine}} as {{temp|rare|medicine}} (where {{temp|rare}} is the template and <tt>medicine</tt> is an argument to it), whereas {{temp|context|rare|medicine}} (where both are arguments to {{temp|context}}) makes more sense.
** This could, of course, be treated more narrowly: we could allow {{temp|context|rare}} to be written as {{temp|rare}} when that's the only label, while forbidding something like {{temp|rare|medicine}}.
* Currently, every context template more or less needs to support every parameter to {{temp|context}}; for example, the fact that {{temp|medicine}} doesn't support <tt>script=</tt> means that {{temp|medicine|literary}} doesn't, either, even though {{temp|context|literary}} ''does''.
** Granted, ''merely'' requiring {{temp|context|medicine}} wouldn't solve this problem, because currently, {{temp|context|medicine|literary}} also depends on {{temp|medicine}} to pass parameters to {{temp|literary}}; ''that'', however, can be fixed, whereas ''this'' cannot.
** And of course, this too would be addressed if we forbade {{temp|medicine|literary}} but allowed bare {{temp|medicine}}.

If we do make this change, we could do it pretty gradually; it wouldn't have to happen overnight. For example, we could use these steps:

# Create a one-time bot to convert existing instances of {{temp|medicine}} to {{temp|context|medicine}}.
# Create a long-running bot, à la AutoFormat, that would convert new instances, until people get used to the idea.
# Eventually modify {{temp|medicine}} to call attention to itself on preview, and start sending polite notices to people who keep using it.
# At some point during this process, modify {{temp|context}} to use e.g. {{temp|context/medicine}} rather than {{temp|medicine}}.
# Eventually modify {{temp|medicine}} to call attention to itself even ''not'' on preview, e.g. adding a cleanup category rather than a sense label.
# Eventually delete {{temp|medicine}}.

: [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|20px]] '''Support'''.  ''However'', I am profoundly confused about the historical background for why {{temp|context|law}} doesn't work.  The first arg to {{temp|context}} is apparently checked to see if there's a template by that name.  This is based on the frighteningly spaghettified cross-calling that this discussion ostensibly seeks to simplify.  If we scrap this difficult-to-understand and difficult-to-maintain cross-calling and only look at {{temp|context}} alone (ideally, from my perspective, even going so far as to expressly disallow and remove specific labeling templates such as {{temp|medicine}}), there would be no need for this template check, and {{temp|context|law}} (and any other context labels that also happen to be language labels or the names of any other templates) would then work as expected.  <small>(''As an aside:''  I suspect we'll go through this again once we have Lua functionality -- much of this will be infinitely simpler once we have a proper programming language to play with.)</small>  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr Útlendi]] │ <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala við mig]]''</small> 22:16, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

I don't remember which one it was. But now that I am aware of them, I am not that sure that it's the best idea to completely disband all of these special templates for sense labels like {{temp|legal}} is.

== Collocations section in entries? ==

Because of our idiomaticity requirement, we do not have entries for common collocations that have meanings that can be derived from their parts. However, it would be incredibly useful to language learners to be able to find some common collocations and phrases, even if they are not idiomatic. A common question for learners is 'how do I say (phrase) in (language)?' So I would like to propose adding such a section to [[WT:ELE]]. I'm not sure whether it would be useful to English entries, but for people who are learning English or have a non-native command, it would still be nice to list them even if we don't give definitions. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:54, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

: That makes sense to me. I sometimes give such collocations in example sentences (or ''as'' example "sentences", if I'm feeling lazy), but giving them their own section would have a number of benefits over that: (1) it would make it less problematic to linkify them if they're reasonably idiomatic, and perhaps to linkify their other component words if not; (2) it would make it less problematic to tag them with qualifiers such as {{qualifier|UK}}; (3) it would make it less problematic to list multiple variants. I also sometimes give them in usage notes, but that's unwieldy in a different way. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:22, 21 April 2012 (UTC)

== Middle English cutoff ==

Currently, [[WT:AEN]] (and the ISO) makes 1500 the cutoff before which texts are Middle English and after which they're modern English. This is also the date I've always used, and the one Prosfilaes favored [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification&oldid=16723499#tyme at RFV#tyme]; on the other hand, Raifʻhār suggested 1470 in the same RFV and Leasnam suggested 1470 [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AnWulf&oldid=16621362#mensk on AnWulf's talk page]. Νικα suggested 1475 in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour archive/2007/April#Middle_English|the only old discussion I can find]]. Those thirty years make a difference, as some terms fail RFV because their latest quotations are pre-1500 (and perhaps others pass with quotations from 1475-1499). Has there been more discussion of this cutoff that I'm not finding? Are we content with 1500 (in which case, let this be an announcement that that ''is'' our current policy), or would someone like to propose pushing the cutoff back (in which case, do so)? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 23:36, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

:Presumably it wouldn't be very smart to treat this too rigidly, whatever year we decide.  If a term is in common usage throughout the 1300's and 1400's, and then has a single quote in 1490, it's clearly Middle English.  In order for it to be treated as English, it'd have to have some significant usage past the era border, going into at least 1550 or so. {{unsigned|Atelaes|23:54, 23 April 2012 (UTC)}}

:: I'm a big fan of bright lines; if there's three quotes ten years past the line, then it may be Middle English, but it's clearly also (Early) Modern English. (One quote doesn't meet CFI for Modern English.) I don't see substantial gains from a fuzzy border that offset the loss in clarity and consistency.

:::Cutoffs always have negative side-effects, but 1500 is a date devoid of intrinsic meaning. An oft-cited date is '''1476''', when the first book was printed in Britain (by [[w:William Caxton]]).

== quotations of Middle English in English entries ==
Closely related to the question of a cutoff date is the question: should we quote Middle English texts, especially in Middle English form, in ==English== sections? This has come up at [[Talk:warish]]. <br> Raifʻhār and I opined in the RFV of undeadliness ([[Talk:undeadliness]]) that books like those quoted in support of [[[[undeadliness]]]] constitute ‘translations’ of Middle English texts into English, and can be cited as English uses of terms: but the pre-1500 editions are clearly Middle English, and it seems to me no less inappropriate to quote them in ==English== sections than to quote late Latin texts in Italian entries. I would favor creating ==Middle English== sections to house the Middle English quotations. but we should come to a decision as a community about what to do. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:22, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:It's all very well to say that 1500 is a "cutoff", but what's it based on? It's pure convention. Look at the texts from around then, you will see there is a perfect continuity of language across this so-called division. In some cases you will have the ridiculous situation of having volumes I and II of a work under Middle English and volumes III and IV under modern English. Look at any citation-based dictionary and you will see citations stretching back at least to the Middle English period: it's a crucial way of showing, under a given headword, how the language has evolved over time. I have no objections to Middle English entries (though I'm not sure who is working on them), but I do object strongly to excluding these citations from modern English entries as well. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 06:29, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: (2) We don't quote Old English works in ==English== sections (nor in ==Middle English== sections), even though Old English works could illustrate that period in the history of words: we keep that information in ==Old English== sections.

:::Again, it's not because they don't use Middle English headers that they see the need to include Middle English citations under English headwords. It's because this is a crucial part of illustrating a word's history. The OED has links with the [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&id=MED36797&egs=all Middle English Dictionary] and all their entries are linked to that where appropriate. It would be easy for them to defer such citations to that site, but they still keep Middle English under English headwords. Why? Because otherwise words and senses would appear to pop into existence from nowhere. We need to show the history of a word's use. It's the basic requirement of citation-based lexicography. I don't know what the point of a Middle English section is, maybe someone interested in just that period wants to work on it. I am not interested in that, I am interested in the history of English words, and like any good dictionary I want Wiktionary to illustrate that. The situation is nothing like Old English, which had grammatical gender and a case system and was a vastly different language from what came after. The change from Old to Middle English is also marked by a gap in the records, so there is a clean break. None of this is true for Middle English. Perhaps you only work with modern sources, or perhaps you aren't interested in citations at all, I don't know. But I work a lot with texts from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and I'm telling you the distinction makes no sense when it comes to citations. English words did not pop into existence in 1500; by 1500, they had already been evolving in certain ways which we need to be able to demonstrate. I am not looking to include ''all'' Middle English words routinely undfer an English header; all I'm saying is that where a modern English word goes back to Middle English, that should be illustrated in the citation evidence. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 08:16, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

As for which languages this rule applies to, you are exaggerating the difference between Middle and Modern English.

== Q about redirects ==

There is a certain class of Japanese nouns that can also be used as verbs.  In specific contexts, these can be verbs as-is, whereas in other contexts, they require the auxiliary verb [[する]] to impart various kinds of conjugational information.  This [[する]] is a full verb in its own right, equating more or less to the English {{m|en|do}}, and thus [noun] + [[する]] is essentially an SOP entry.

To avoid SOP-ness, and since these [noun] terms can also act as a verb on its own, Haplology and I have been adding the verb senses to the bare term entries themselves.  This raises the question of how to ensure that a Wiktionary user who might not be fluent in Japanese would find these entries if they enter [noun][[する]] into the URL or search bar.

In a thread in the Grease pit ([[Wiktionary:GREASE#How_the_search_feature_works_.28and_doesn.27t_work.29]]), Ruakh clued me in to the possibility of using a do-nothing template param that would hold a string intended to generate a search hit.  This does work to some extent, but only when a user uses the search feature.  Typing this string into the URL fails out, whereas a redirect would work.

Since the [noun][[する]] combination is perforce specific to Japanese, and since a redirect would thus not affect any other language, would other editors be opposed to using redirects from the SOP (but common in English-language teaching materials) [noun][[する]] forms to the [noun] entries?  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr Útlendi]] │ <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala við mig]]''</small> 06:25, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

== Modern Latin ==

Due to Latin being an extinct language, one citation is sufficient for each term. However, the posts above about Middle English led me to this question: are modern usages of Latin acceptable? What if a term is only used in medieval texts? Based on how often I see "New Latin", I'd guess there are a fair few of them. I also think we ought to accept them, when tagged as not being Classical. 

The issue is really about words that are only found in 20th and 21st century works. I am currently reading ''[[w:la:Winnie Ille Pu|Winnie ille Pu]]'' and I plan sometime soon to read ''[[w:la:Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis|Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis]]''. There are some words in these that are clearly legitimate (like [[w:la:Hamaxostichus|hamaxostichus]]), but describe things that did not exist before the modern age (in this case, trains). Am I justified in adding them with a citation from such a work? --[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup> 00:15, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Re: Your first sentence: Sorry, I don't see what you're getting at. Obviously extinct languages can still be used — this whole discussion is about how we treat modern uses of Latin — and if they couldn't, then there would be no ''need'' to specify "contemporaneous". No? You say that you interpret "contemporaneous" differently, but you don't say how you interpret it. I don't think this discussion can proceed any further until you explain that.
:: Re: Hebrew: we've decided to treat all forms of Hebrew as a single language, so it's not extinct. If we decided instead to treat Ancient Hebrew and Modern Hebrew as separate languages (as Ethnologue does), then we'd have to figure out how we distinguish them, and terms like "extinct" and "contemporaneous" would presumably fall out naturally from that.

:::Essentially my argument is that your interpretation of contemporaneous is just that - your personal interpretation without the vote giving any indication that that's what it means. Quite simply I'm not interpreting it in the same way. There really is nothing to explain. [[contemporaneous#English|Contemporaneous]] says "Existing or created in the same period of time" which you interpret in this context as referring only to living language.

::::Ah, so you interpret "usage in at least one contemporaneous source" as meaning the same as "usage in at least one source". In that case, I think you are wrong to say that the vote gives no indication: on the contrary, I think the fact that the vote includes the word "contemporaneous" is, in itself, an indication that "contemporaneous" is to be read as having some relevant meaning. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 21:16, 25 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: (More generally — whenever any halfway-intelligent person espouses any interpretation about anything, it's because (s)he thinks that that interpretation is indicated by that thing. That's the whole point of interpretation. It's not "make up something related", it's "figure out what something means in its context". In general, to rebut an interpretation, you need to provide either a reason to think that it's wrong, or else a reason to think that some other interpretation is as valid or more so. Describing an interpretation as a "personal interpretation", without offering any alternative, is pretty useless, except that sometimes it can be a decent way to infuriate someone. And hopefully infuriation is not your goal, because this is not one of those times.

== Implied nouns ==

I recently expanded {{m|grc|τέταρτος||fourth|tr=tetartos}}, and I came upon some difficulty in conveying some of the information in proper Wiktionary fashion.  In its primary sense, the definition is fairly straightforward, it's the ordinal version of {{m|grc|τέσσαρες||four}}.  However, some of its other senses, while fairly intuitive to understand, are somewhat difficult to rigorously explain.  For example, definition 3.2 means [[quart]], as in a liquid measure.  That definition is essentially when {{m|grc|τέταρτος}} is attached to {{m|grc|μοῖρα||part, portion}}.  The word {{m|grc|μοῖρα||part, portion}} doesn't actually have to be in the clause, or the paragraph, or even the work for that matter.  It can be implied by the context, as it is in the Herodotus work cited for it (follow the link, if you don't believe me).  I'm almost positive English can do similar things, but I'm at a loss as to think of any examples.  My reference (the LSJ 8th edition) uses the syntax "(sub. {{lang|grc|μοῖρα}})" to explain the grammar, with sub. being listed in the list of abbreviations as "subaudi", which is absolute jibberish to me, but I was already aware of the phenomenon, and so understood anyway.  My solution is {{temp|grc-sub.}}, which simply makes a {{temp|context}} like parenthetical note "with x".  Obviously, this should eventually get an appendix, but I don't have the gumption to write one up on the spot.  In any case, does anyone have any thoughts on how to more clearly explicate this in a definition list?  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 02:38, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

::My experience, in Ancient Greek at least, is that nouns and substantive adjectives function identically: they both function as grammatical nouns, take the definite article, can be modified by adjectives, etc.  Some adjectives strongly prefer a certain gender, and usually function as substantives, and it can be only determined on scant evidence that they even are adjectives ({{m|grc|θεός}} is an example that comes to mind).  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 11:30, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

Likewise there's a neuter noun [[τέταρτον]] that means "a fourth, a quarter", a feminine noun [[τοξική]] that means both "archery" and "a shothole", a masculine noun [[τοξικός]] that means "a bowman" (attested only in the plural), and a neuter noun [[τοξικόν]] that means "poison for smearing arrows with".

Unlike any other dictionary, we have separate entries for [[dog]] and [[dogs]]; for {{l|es|rojo}}, {{l|es|roja}}, {{l|es|rojos}}, and {{l|es|rojas}}; and for [[τέταρτος]], [[τετάρτη]], and [[τέταρτον]] as adjectives quite apart from their substantivized meanings.

::::::::: We do have separate entries for [[dogs]] and [[dog]], and [[messages]] and [[message]], but I was quite unhappy that we had some senses at [[messages]] that we didn't even point to from [[message]]. I'm happy with entries like [[bang]] and [[scissor]], and the current revision of [[message]], which I edited so that it does point out the additional definitions at the plural form. ([[line|Line]] similarly has a sense which should technically be [[the line]].) If we move these elliptical senses to specifically gendered inflected forms, we'll need to point them out in usage notes in the lemma entries (like [[messages]]), or how will anyone ever find them? Contributors who know none of the language will copy-and-paste the term and get the right page, but contributors who know enough of the language to search for the lemma, aware that our inflected forms almost never contain information beyond "Foo form of [[bar]]", won't find the senses.

:::::::::: I disagree with the current state of [[message]] and [[messages]], since now the meaning "groceries, shopping" is not listed in a definition line anywhere. It's in a usage note at [[message]] and hidden on the Citations page at [[messages]]. As for the Greek forms, I would actually list the noun meanings under Derived forms of the adjective's lemma. Readers who know enough Ancient Greek to be looking for nouns like [[τετάρτη]] will know enough to look for it under its nominative singular [[τετάρτη]] (as opposed to one of the other cases, or the plural), but if they only encounter it ''as a noun'' they will probably ''not'' look for it under the masculine adjective form [[τέταρτος]]--you can't tell from looking at τετάρτη that it's "basically" an adjective rather than a noun. In a paper dictionary that's not such a big deal, because if you look up [[τετάρτη]] you will immediately see the adjective [[τέταρτος]] and will look there instead. But here, if I encounter a noun [[τετάρτη]] in my Greek reading and come to Wiktionary and look for it there, and all that page tells me it that it's an inflected form of the adjective [[τέταρτος]], I'll be confused because what I have on my page is a noun ending in -η, not an adjective ending in -ος. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 19:57, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Flemish language]] and [[Template:vls]] ==

This category failed RFD a while ago, and it is now almost empty, with most of its contents having been moved to Dutch. What should we do with its code, {{temp|vls}}? Wikipedia uses that code specifically for West Flemish ([http://vls.wikipedia.org/ West Flemish Wikipedia]), and I think that would make sense because there is a stronger consensus within the linguistic community that it is a language, at least compared to Flemish/Belgian Dutch in general. It's not recognised politically as a language, but still. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:37, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

== $wgPFEnableStringFunctions ==

The [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions ParserFunctions] extension now includes string functions, but these need to be enabled separately. As of right now this is disabled, so the string functions don't work. I'd like to vote to enable these. Of all the Wikipedia wikis I can think of, Wiktionary would probably be able to make the most use of string functions, because we work with words so much. These functions would allow us to write templates that automatically adjust endings added to words based on the page name. So for example, {{temp|en-noun}} would add -s for the plural most of the time, but it could automatically add -es or replace -y with -ies when appropriate, and without needing an additional parameter. Similarly, it would allow a template like {{temp|fr-conj-er}} and many other inflection templates to drop the 'stem' parameter, because for a word like [[chanter]] the string functions could automatically extract the 'chant-' from the page name. This makes templates much less error-prone because of forgotten or mistaken parameters and such. There are of course many other possibilities. In any case I think these would be incredibly useful and I don't really see any problems at all. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:15, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

== Proto-Slavic: Why are ь and ъ used for ĭ and ŭ? ==

I've been wondering this for a while now. All other sources I came across about Slavic so far use the Latin letters ĭ and ŭ and not the Cyrillic equivalents. Even our own transliteration of Old Church Slavonic uses those letters. So why not in Proto-Slavic? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:47, 27 April 2012 (UTC)
:I've seen both used, but I think ь and ъ are more common, especially in more modern sources. The same is true of transliterated OCS, but only when the Cyrillic isn't also provided. Since we provide both Cyrillic and Latin for OCS, it would be redundant to use ь/ъ in both, but for Proto-Slavic we only provide Latin, so it isn't redundant. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 00:11, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

::I believe the reason for this is that the precise phonetic values of ь and ъ are not known for certain, and representing them as ĭ and ŭ might be incorrect. In the case of OCS, that language is still spoken (for liturgical purposes) and we know its phonology. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 05:03, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

: ''[[w:yer|Jers]]'' in Proto-Slavic reconstructions are usually not transliterated into Latin. Cyrillic characters are used simply because it's the most common practice in the books/papers. It's quite common for OCS too, but as Angr explained it doesn't really make sense for us to use it. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 20:13, 6 May 2012 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Cajun French language]] ==

To my surprise, we have a [[:Category:Cajun French language]] and a {{temp|frc}}. It is useful to distinguish Cajun French from general French in etymologies and when the usage of a word is <nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:context|restricted]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>; we do this for [[:Category:Quebec French]]. I think we should do the same for Cajun French: but I think we should rename [[:Category:Cajun French language]] to [[:Category:Cajun French]], and ''not'' use {{temp|frc}} (perhaps rename it {{temp|etyl:frc}}) ''except'' in etymologies. Cajun French and Quebec French have very limited syntactic, pronunciatory and lexical differences from the French spoken in Europe and around the world, just as Southern US English and Canadian English have limited syntactic, pronunciatory and lexical differences from the English spoken in Europe and around the world; I do not think it is appropriate to treat either as a separate language, and as Quebec French is already not treated as separate, I think it is especially odd to treat Cajun French as separate.

== Taxonomic names ==

I am trying to straighten out taxonomic names. It is not something that I can specify in advance, in the abstract. Those folks who have more subject area knowledge and might be able to specify everything in advance decline to get involved. 

First I am trying to have a basic standard layout. I only have a few of the easier elements laid out. I view the effort as at a stage of trying to facilitate the accumulation of information from other wikis. I would like to keep it easy to take advantage of wikipedia's and wikispecies information on vernacular names. They both have vernacular names for multiple languages at entries that tend to be at taxonomic names. A list of English synonyms is common at WP. For now, I intend to use translation tables to accumulate vernacular names which are not, strictly speaking synonyms, not really being appropriate for the same context and the synonyms headers for both taxonomic synonyms and English vernacular names. 

For some entries where there is information at WP on the geographic spread of the species or genus I have experimented with translation requests. That is what happened on that table you removed. If you would like to participate in this, I am trying to start a discussion at [[Wiktionary Talk:About Translingual#Translation of Translingual words]].

== Audio files. ==

Boa! Realmente é capaz de demorar uns tempos. Talvez um robot tratasse disto num instante, como alguém no wikcionário francês quer fazer, mas eles têm que criar quase todos os artigos.
Só um pormenor: Já que se edita, porque não acrescentar o IPA (ou [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfabeto_fon%C3%A9tico_internacional AFI - Alfabeto fonético internacional] como tem [[Lisboa]]? É copiar os símbolos dos artigos da Wikipedia inglesa e meter no "Template" "{{IPA|pt|/liʒbuə/|a=PT}}".

Vou pedir a um amigo meu para acrescentá-los numa versão do [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Lista_de_concelhos_por_NUTS Anexo:Lista de concelhos por NUTS] que está a fazer para a en-wikipedia, pois o "Template" IPA lá  ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈβɾɐ̃tɨʃ|-|Pt-pt Abrantes FF.ogg}}) dá para juntar o IPA/AFI e o som, como se pode ver comparando "São Paulo" na pt-wiki e na en-wiki. Assim é só ir buscar a informação à lista e não aos artigos!!!! Lembrei-me agora que talvez seja só uma questão de traduzir o Template inglês para português... Ou copiá-lo para aqui???

Talvez depois acrescente à informação dos ficheiros audio, quando os dividir alfabeticamente, É que na Categoria,, por exemplo em Águeda, como tem acento, não fica com os outros "A".

== Egyptian Edits ==

Hi.

I see that you reformed the headers at ˤ3, which confirmed to the standard currently set out at Wiktionary:About Egyptian. That standard is still in draft phase, and there is discussion ongoing about these exact points on its talk page, so I was wondering whether you might want to offer some criticism of the policy as a whole - so that it can be brought more into line with wiktionary users' expectations (If so, you'll possibly want to skip past the bits on hieroglyphs).

Your changes were to divide each sub entry into its own etymology, and to shift the alternative forms out front of the POS. With regards to the first change, I'm not sure whether enough is known about Egyptian etymology to do that (But I'm sure this, and I feel it has the potential to add an extra level of clutter to pages where each PoS is a separate etymology.

With regards to the second issue, I'm less ambivalent, as, on the one hand, Egyptian varient spellings tend to be specific to particular parts of speech (i.e. if there is an etymologically linked noun and verb, they'll still probably be written differently in hieroglyphs), while on the other, I want to have the standard hieroglyphs appear first, because otherwise they come awfully late in the entry (Since, unlike in normal entries, they aren't in the title space).

Finally, I note your decision to keep [[mȝt]], which is an alternate modern transcription of [[m3t]] (Not really an alternative form in the Egyptian - both are Roman alphabetic representations of the exact same Egyptian word). There has been significant discussion of what to do about these different forms on my talk page ([[User talk:Furius#Redirects]]), which didn't really achieve a great deal of consensus (I'd been turning alternate transliterations into redirects and there were objections). I don't think it desirable to have a separate page for each of the many possible transcriptions of any given word - it's very messy, especially since some are really only typographical variants of the same transliteration system (e.g. ȝ vs 3, in which the use of ȝ is non-standard, and 3 is a fallback).
I welcome your comments on any or all of these points, as how Egyptian works on wiktionary is only in the very early stages of standardisation.
[[User:Furius|Furius]] ([[User talk:Furius|talk]]) 06:49, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

: ''(Egyptian etymology)'': really? I thought Proto-Semitic was well documented. In any case, the entries will need to be split into various PoS sections, so the clutter is unavoidable.
: ''(they'll still probably be written differently in hieroglyphs)'': in our standard entry layout alternative forms come before what they are alternative to. You can add the Alternative Forms heading just before the PoS heading plus one level.
: ''(keep [[mȝt]])'': I should have used {{temp|alternative spelling of}} instead of {{temp|alternative form of}} (now fixed). The best solution would be to use actual hieroglyph characters (Unicode has them) for the actual entries, and have transliteration stubs linking to it. This is how we deal with Gothic (see [[weihs]]); Gothic also has transliteration issues (hw vs. ƕ). If both ȝ and 3 are widely used, I suggest both have an entry (one of them as an {{temp|alternative spelling of}}).
: I probably won’t be cleaning up Egyptian anymore, because you were [[WT:WL|whitelisted]] yesterday and your edits won’t need to be patrolled anymore. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 14:36, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

== Re ==

I think [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Noah&diff=18415336&oldid=18374557 this] rollback nd the other were in error. i.e. if you check this page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_prophets_of_Abrahamic_religions] these figures are also revered by non-Biblical faiths. [[User:Pass a Method|Pass a Method]] ([[User talk:Pass a Method|talk]]) 07:09, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

:FWIW, I think putting "Abrahamic" or "Abrahamic religions" as a context is wrong, because even non-religious people use the term "Noah" as the name of "an Old Testament character who [is said to have] built an ark". (It's not like non-religious people call him something else.) But {{temp|biblical character}} is like putting {{temp|context|mammal}} in [[[[bear]]]] (something we don't do)... so I think there should be no tag at all, though we may want to raise this issue in a bigger forum. Yes, {{temp|biblical character}} puts entries into [[:Category:en:Biblical characters]], but I think categorisation should be done as it is in [[[[bear]]]] (which is in [[:Category:en:Mammals]] "manually"). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 09:03, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

: It wasn’t in error. First of all, you used {{temp|sense}} instead of {{temp|context}}. That alone is good enough reason to revert, but if it was just that I’d have fixed it myself. I added the explanation to my undo at [[Solomon]] and reverted the other similar edits, hoping that you’d notice Solomon’s edit summary. Here it is: “ It’s a biblical character. If it also found elsewhere elsewhere append another context template.” You see, your removal of the {{temp|biblical character}} template removed [[Solomon]], [[Noah]], etc. from [[:Category:Biblical characters]], which is just wrong because they ''are'' biblical characters! If you had changed it to {{temp|context|Abrahamic}} (or {{temp|context|Abrahamic religions}}, which I prefer for clarity’s sake) and added [[:Category:Biblical characters]] manually to the entry I wouldn’t have minded. Even better: create a context template for {{temp|Abrahamic religions}}. Furthermore, things like this require [[WT:BP|Beer Parlour]] discussion. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 17:50, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

== Audiorecordings ==

Hello, I would like to know, how do i upload or record audio recordings for word entries??? {{unsigned|Elperretebueno}}
:Hi. First, you need to record the pronunciation using an external software. I recommend you use Audacity. See [[User:Mikemoral/Audio|this]] for details. If the word is Georgian, name the recorded file ''ka-word.ogg''; for example, the pronunciation file for [[შუბი]] must be named ''ka-შუბი.ogg''. Then upload the file [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&uploadformstyle=basic here]. Finally, you must link to the file from Wiktionary like [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%83%A8%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98&action=historysubmit&diff=13502864&oldid=13502796 this]. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] 07:54, 10 July 2011 (UTC)

It would benefit very much from your vote, even one of abstention.

I assume you would be interested in this subject, as I am sending this message to everyone who didn't vote yet, but participated in [[WT:BP#English names of stars, etc.|the discussion]] that introduced the vote, and/or in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour archive/2011/May#Straw poll: Topical category languages|this poll]], which received far more attention than the vote, and is closely related to the proposal in question.

Hi Vahag,

Is all-caps ever used in Armenian? (Like, how in English we can write LIKE THIS to simulate shouting?)

== Several questions ==

Barev Vahagn!

One day I wanted to create a new entry for the Georgian word [[ჩემთვის]](translation: for me), but I dunno what part of speech it is; So, have any ideas? And there're many more words like this. 

Also, why do the declensional templates(e.g. Georgian etc.) have to show transliterations too? If our final goal is to make articles for all words and even inflected forms too, then in the end we will also have transliterations for all words(as this is a part of our goal), and one can easily follow the link within the table of declension. So i'm guessing it is temporary, is it?

And lastly, can you explain what is difference between verb, verbal noun and verb form? or what header should I use when describing a word like this : ვსვამ(vsvam) (I'm drinking), if i tell you that whe just have verbal noun and verbs(I mean words that describe an action, have tense , take object/subject, mood); So, verb form or verb? I guess it isnt verbal noun :D.

And after the last:D, [[წიგნის მაღაზია]] & [[ცხენის ძალა]] they are noun phrases, yeah? Thx--[[User:Dixtosa|88.123.102.25]] 15:24, 19 February 2012 (UTC)

:Privet, Dixtul. 

:I don't know Georgian and I don't know what part of speech [[ჩემთვის]] is. Probably a pronoun.

:Transliterations in declension tables are not temporary. Having the transliterations of inflected forms on one page is very convenient. By looking at them you can learn inflection patterns, without having to click on each form separately.

:"Verb form" is not a part of speech. In Wiktionary we use names like "noun form" or "verb form" to designate ''inflected'' forms, as opposed to [[lemma]] forms, also known as [[citation form]]s. For example, [[კაცი]] is a "noun", [[კაცების]] is a "noun form". Another example, Russian {{m|ru|пить}} is a "verb", {{m|ru|пью}} is a "verb form". The first one should be categorized in [[:Category:Russian verbs]], the second one in [[:Category:Russian verb forms]]; but both should have a ===Verb=== heading. Georgian [[ვსვამ]] is a verb form and should be formatted like [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%83%95%E1%83%A1%E1%83%95%E1%83%90%E1%83%9B&action=historysubmit&diff=16298302&oldid=16278305 this]; ideally it should be defined with reference to its lemma form, which is [[სმა]]. See how Spanish [[bebo#Spanish]] is defined as ''First-person singular (yo) present indicative form of [[beber]]''.

:If you want my advice, don't waste your time on creating verb forms and noun forms. That should be done by bots, someday in the future. You should just create entries for the infinitive of verbs and the singular nominative of nouns.

:I don't know anything about verbal nouns in Georgian to say whether they should be treated as "verbs", "verb forms" or as a separate part of speech.

:As for [[წიგნის მაღაზია]] and [[ცხენის ძალა]], I think they should be defined as nouns. The first one seems to be a sum of parts. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] 17:59, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

::thx. Hm, as the results of my observations suggest, <nowiki>{{</nowiki>LangCode-verb}} is usually used for infinitives and cuz Georgian daznt differ verbal noun and infinitive(in other words, infinitives in Georgian are called verbal nouns), we have to promote verbal noun(thus make template ''ka-verbal noun'') and delete ''ka-verb''(as it gets useless) or promote ''ka-verb'' and stop the practice of making verbal nouns under the ''head|ka|verbal noun'' template. So we have to make desicion. I prefer the first.
::yeah that's purely wasting time, but u know some inflected forms convey meanings other than what is supposed. and that other meanings prompt me to create entry.--[[User:Dixtosa|Wikstosa]] 20:02, 23 February 2012 (UTC)

:::You're the only native Georgian contributor, so if you think it's better to use ''ka-verbal noun'' and delete ''ka-verb'', go for it. I have no opinion. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 22:08, 24 February 2012 (UTC)

Thank you for the Old Armenian addition to the [[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-04/Languages_with_limited_documentation|vote for languages with limited documentation]].

== oǰ-type ==

Ok subject line might be a bit misleading, but you know I'm lazy. So I was thinking that at a certain point, when my Armenian is better and my understanding of the underlying grammatical functions is more thorough I'll maybe write some appendices and the notes in the titles of templates like the noun declension templates can link to such appendices, like [[Appendix:Armenian declension/oǰ-type]] or something. I probably won't do in-depth ones for a while, since Wiktionary's been getting on my last nerve recently and the story is taking a lot of my focus, but I think I might do some basic ones like how to compare adjectives and stuff like that. Grammar is so friggin' sexy.

:::::::: What an awesome word... it's so fitting lol. So I just remembered two of the questions that have been floating in my head for a while about Armenian now so I'll unindent. Both of them have to do with the song I mentioned.

: One I think might be harder to answer because it's a question of phonology, but the guy's pronunciation kind of makes it sound like ր is devoiced at the end of a word, like in Turkish and Icelandic. 
: The other is about an Armenian verbs numerous impersonal forms... the participles and converbs. In Հասնելու եմ, there's a line that says "Լույս թե մութ ճամփաներ ուզածի եմ հասնելու", which I don't quite get despite the fact that I know all the individual words except 'uzac', because I don't know what that participle does.

::Don't know the answer to the phonology question. As for the second, it should be "Լույս թե մութ ճամփաներ, ուզածի'''ս''' եմ հասնելու". It means "bright or dark paths, I will reach what I want". {{m|hy||Ուզած}} is the resultative participle of {{m|hy|ուզել}} and means "that which is wanted". {{m|hy||Ուզածի}} is its genitive/dative case. With the first-person possessive suffix {{m|hy|-ս}} it means "to that which I want".
::The subject participle is easy: 
::{{m|hy|ուզել||to want}} > {{m|hy|ուզող||wanter, wanting person or thing, хотящий}} 
::{{m|hy|նայել||to watch}} > {{m|hy|նայող||looker, looking person or thing, смотрящий}} 
::{{m|hy|վիճել||to dispute}} > {{m|hy|վիճող||disputant}}
:: {{m|hy|կարող}} is not a participle. It's formed with the suffix {{m|xcl|-ող}} in Old Armenian. Of course, the participle ending has its origin in that Old Armenian suffix. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 16:30, 5 May 2012 (UTC)

Their pronunciation follows the spellings, because at the time of their reintroduction people did not have organically inherited equivalents in their dialects.

How is this language actually defined? Normally, a proto-language is considered to be the ancestor of a family, but what if the family has only one language in it? What distinguishes Proto-Armenian from attested Classical Armenian? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 13:20, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
:It is defined as the stage of Armenian starting from its separation from Proto-Indo-European (3rd millennium BC) until its attestation in the 5th century AD (the beginning of Classical Armenian). I don't see why the ancestor of a single language can't be called a proto-language. There is [[w:Proto-Basque language|Proto-Basque]] and [[w:Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]].
:I don't know enough to comment on the differences between Classical Armenian and Proto-Armenian. I don't think Proto-Armenian has been properly reconstructed, because you have only one descendant.

I think this is what may have happened: perhaps Persian formed the noun {{m|fa|دلاک||waiter at baths; barber|tr=dallāk}} [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:6931.steingass] from the Arabic verb {{l|ar|دلك|tr=dálaka}} and from Persian were borrowed Georgian {{m|ka|დალაქი}}, Armenian {{m|hy|դալլաք}}, Turkish {{m|tr|tellak}}. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 20:03, 24 September 2012 (UTC)

:::Oh, so Persian took that form. Needs Persian {{l|fa|ک}} though. That Persian dictionary still uses Arabic letters (which used to be fairly common if someone only had Arabic fonts). [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 20:15, 24 September 2012 (UTC)

:Yes, it's confusing, some Arabic and Persian letters look alike (at least in some positions) but they are not the same letters but they "reveal themselves" in other positions. As for etymology, you can refer to the Arabic root {{l|ar|دلك|tr=dálaka}}, at least for the time being, it's safer than pointing to any derived form, IMHO.

Hey there! I'm curious about [[մասին|this page]]. The part-of-speech category is marked as conjunction, but to my eyes it looks more like a postposition (in this case governing the genitive 'dra').

|-
| Negative conditional future perfect || չ + "to be" (aux) imperfect + conneg || չէի լինի || ||

|}

Judging from this table, the negative չ can be prefixed to the following finite forms:

* All forms of the auxiliary "եմ"
* All forms of the aorist
* All forms of the subjunctive future 
* All forms of the subjunctive future perfect

According to the table on [[լինել]] it can also be prefixed to the following non-finite forms:

* Infinitive
* Conneg
* Resultative participle
* Subject participle

There are the following prefix groups:

* '''No prefix''': {imperfective, perfective, simultaneous, future I, future II} participle, imperative
* '''չ only''': aorist, infinitive, resultative participle, subject participle, conneg
* '''չ and կ''': subjunctive future, subjunctive future perfect

::<nowiki>:)</nowiki> Ok, great, thanks! Next question... the passive and causative, (a) these are derivations?  e.g. verb + passive gets the whole verbal paradigm after ? (b) if so, is the verbal paradigm after a passive morpheme regular ? e.g. will it be the same in all cases, or will it depend on the passive stem ? (c) presumably the passive morpheme can only come after transitive stems.

== Verbal inflection ==

From reading the grammar (Modern Eastern Armenian), and the templates [[:Template:hy-conj-ել]], [[:Template:hy-conj-ալ]] and [[:Template:hy-conj-ցն-ել]], could I draw the following conclusions?:

* In order to account for all possibilities of stem changes, a program to conjugate Armenian verbs would need to know about the following stems / irregular forms: 
** Present (e.g. tan-)
** Aorist (e.g. tar-)
** Passive (if the verb is transitive, with a passive) -- (e.g. tarv-)
** Causative (if the verb has a causative) 
** Imperative (e.g. tar!-)
* All the suffixes and prefixes are entirely regular depending on the verb type -el, -al, -c’nel. 

In most cases the passive and causative stems will be regular (in -v- and -cʿn-), but sometimes they will be irregular. 

Are there any irregular suffixes at all ? -- e.g. that depend on a particular stem ? - [[User:Francis Tyers|Francis Tyers]] ([[User talk:Francis Tyers|talk]]) 21:22, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

:For 99.99% of the verbs the program would only need the present stem and the aorist stem. The passive, causative and imperative can be deduced from them. All the suffixes and prefixes are entirely regular for these verbs. The other 0.01% with irregularities are collected in [[:Category:Armenian irregular verbs]]. They have irregularities in the Passive or Causative or Imperative or Aorist. The set of suffixes is different for {{m|hy|գալ}}, {{m|hy|տալ}}, {{m|hy|լալ}}. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 10:53, 3 December 2012 (UTC)

== FWOTD ==

Hi. I'm looking for more words to add to the [[WT:FW|Foreign Word of the Day]], and I was wondering if you could suggest some words in Armenian and Old Armenian. The only requirements are that they need at least one citation (a reference or quotation) and pronunciation each. For example, if you add IPA to [[առածիմ]], we can feature that. I'd like to get words that express ideas that are not used much in English as a single word or that express interesting concepts, but aren't ''too'' rare. If you have anything from other languages you're familiar with, that would be great as well. Thanks! —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 23:09, 15 December 2012 (UTC)

:I can't think of anything interesting right now, I have to think. Adding IPA to Old Armenian entries is not possible, it's phonology is disputed, we don't know for sure how it was pronounced.

::Well, if there is a certain phonological reconstruction you like for Old Armenian, you can add the IPA preceded by {{temp|a|Reconstructed per Martirosyan}} or whomever.

== [[User:Ruakh/Tbot.js]] скрипт для ускоренного создания статей из переводов ==

Привет,

Ползователь Ruakh создал программку для быстрого создания статей из переводов на русский язык. Работает очень хорошо, я протестировал. Нужно только добавить код (зависит от оболочки, которую ты используешь) в Викисловаре и перезагрузить браузер. Склонение, спряжение, синонимы и прочее нужно добавлять в ручную.

Одним щелчком в переводе на русский слова [[abstinence]]:
<pre>
=={{subst:ru}}==

===Noun===
{{ru-noun|tr=vozderžánije|g=n}}

# [[abstinence]] {{gloss|the act or practice of abstaining}}

</pre>

Остается добавить другие значения (если есть), склонение, и т.д.

<pre>=={{subst:ru}}==</pre> автоматически меняется на '''Russian''' после сохранения.

Этот скрипт сможет работать и с другими языками, только нужно добавить код языка, но не со всеми одинаково. Сообщи, если интересно, помогу установить или свяжись напрямую с Руахом. (Если не хочешь с ним общаться или тебе это неинтересно, просто проигнорируй мой пост). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 01:02, 8 January 2013 (UTC)

{{lang|und|sc=Armn|խունջիկ-մունջիկ}} is in a song I like--a song that's probably much more stupid than I realize so I'm afraid to work on translating it, but that word sticks out so hard I can't help asking.

Спасибо, что исправил, Вааг ([[татарин]])!

У меня есть вопрос к тебе. Я начал делать шаблоны для глаголов [[User_talk:Stephen_G._Brown#Русские_глаголы]]. Похоже некоторые глаголы слишком нерегулярные по Зализняку. В русском викисловаре где-то 350 шаблонов. Ты думаешь действительно такое количество нужно? Мне кажется, что например 4-ую группу, разбитую на несколько шаблонов, можно соединить (смотри [[Talk:гневить#same_conjugation]]), добавив параметр для первого лица ед. числа. Ты наверное уже думал по поводу шаблонов.

::It may be well known, but most linguists believe that it is commonly misunderstood. 
:I don't really see that ''grammar'' is a valid usage context. ''Linguistics'' is. Some of the more basic terms with the ''grammar'' usage context are not at all restricted to use by linguists or grammarians, eg [[passive]], [[tense]], [[verb]]. It would seem that almost all of the words so marked are within the subject of grammar, which should lead to the item being put into <nowiki>Category:en:Grammar</nowiki>. I suppose that all items that now have the grammar usage context belong in the category, but none of them should have "grammar" display. Some of the items with the grammar usage context should have the linguistics context label because they are not generally understood by someone not a linguist, eg [[adessive case]]. 
:Perhaps {{temp|grammar}} should be reworked to display "linguistics", while continuing to categorize into Grammar, and the less technical terms be hard-categorized into Grammar and the context label removed.

:::I have tried on a few entries to make a distinction between a popular definition of a term and, say, a chemist's of physicist's definition. Many of our words like {{term|iron}} or {{term|graphite}} which are commonly used by non-technical people do not mean to them what they mean to chemists or physicists. We often did not recognize that difference. I am reasonably sure that the same thing applies to these terms. A truly comprehensive and descriptive dictionary ''should'' have both kinds of definition. Clearly the ''linguist'' context would only apply to a technical one (if indeed ''one'' could be found). If we want to have "topic" tags, we certainly can, but some kind of distinction still exists between usage context and topic. If the community of aerospace engineers were to have its own slang term for an attractive woman, the usage context would be ''aerospace'', but the topic would not be.

If other dictionaries do use context labels as topic labels sufficiently often (say, where the intended use is obvious, as in the dictionaries he mentioned with the label "grammar" -- probably relying on the reader's common sense to get the right interpretation), then this would seem to be accepted practice for dictionary making. Is Wiktionary trying to start a new practice or tradition? Should it? Isn't it better to follow existing models?

:::::::You would not be intruding, even if you had not initiated the topic.
:::::::One could take a look at {{R:OneLook|verb}} to conveniently see how a few of the fuller dictionaries handle the ''verb'' case. Collins has a context-like long explanation, which seems a promising approach to me. MWOnline has no context, but a somewhat verbose (and technical?) definition with no context label. 
:::::::There is relatively little reason for a print dictionary to note topic areas. For us, we have categories, which can help a user locate terms. The sole point of having topical labels at the sense level is that, in long entries (eg, [[[[head]]]]), a user coming to the entry from a category, might have trouble locating the sense(s) sought. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  13:03, 3 July 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::I like the Collins solution. Now, speaking for myself as a consumer of dictionaries, I actually like it when there are topic labels -- even if they may be redundant (I knew the topic from the category search). I like it in print dictionaries when a certain mammal name is provided with a label ''(mammal)'' right at the beginning -- it confirms my expectations and makes it less likely that I may have gotten to the wrong word by mistake. True, this is more often done in dictionaries of foreign languages for learners (where redundancy is more important), but I don't think this disturbs the casual reader; quite the contrary, it may make him/her feel safer about having understood the word in the right way. In other words, why avoid topic labels? In what way do they cause disturbances or confusion? If space were costly here, as in many printed dictionaries, I could understand that -- but Wiktionary has the advantage of having all the space we need at no cost. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 06:44, 4 July 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::The issue is how to indicate whether a sense of term is likely to be understood outside of a restricted group or usage context. In the case of ''verb'' as defined at Collins, I would mark the second sense with a ''linguistics'' tag and leave the other unmarked, though I don't object to their verbose equivalent. If the same label is used for both purposes then the user could not tell which we were trying to indicate. Formerly, some entries were marked with ''jargon'', but there was some agreement that the word is too pejorative. It certainly wouldn't be accurate for the difference between senses of ''verb''. We could insert <nowiki>{{context|among|_|linguists|lang=und}}</nowiki> and make sure that {{temp|linguists}} categorized into [[:Category:en:Linguistics]]. Full implementation of such an approach would take a long time to complete, were it to get acceptance.

:: At first glance, the only functional differences I can see between the two is that {{temp|onym}} italicizes transliterations by default, which is undesirable for some languages like JA, where transliterations are by policy given in multiple scripts; and that {{temp|l}} puts the gloss in a separate set of parentheses, which is just plain ugly in most cases.

Hi there.  I have always known people to pronounce "secondment" with a "v" - a bit like "seconvent". The emphasis was on the "con".  But no-one seems to that any more and the pronunciation is always as you'd expect, with "cond" rhyming with "bond".  So was the "seconvent" variant a family idiosyncrasy, as it were, or am I mis-remembering? Or am I just associating with the wrong people?

== Definition of the name " KOOVALLOOR" ==

My family name is " KOOVALLOOR". I was investgating how the name name formed and I was able to find it. In front of my Grand Father's house there was a medicinal tree known as "KUVAL" (the tree is intended  for  treating snake bite),   also pronounced as " KOOVAL" in Malayalam, an Indian Language. OOR in our language means "place". That means , combining both words together in our language Malayalam,  it was formed as KOOVAL+ OOR =" KOOVALLOOR" , "place where Kuval tree is planted", in Malayalam. There are similar words in Malayalam ending in "OOR", for example AND+ OOR = ANDOOR, ADD+ OOR = ADOOR, MED+ OOR= METTOOR, KIDANG+ OOR = KIDANGOOR.

== How to "move" an entry on here from an incorrect spelling? ==

Hi. I was just browsing around doing a random word search in Tok Pisin, and I've come across one of the words which is spelled incorrectly.  I'm just wondering how to move them, since I've made very few contributions to Wiktionary and am sort of new at it, despite being a Wikipedian for almost 8 years.  The word is {{term|katon}}, which is listed as meaning "carton" or "box" in Tok Pisin.  The term is correctly spelled at {{term|katen}}, and I'm just wondering if someone could guide me in the right direction. Thanks :) [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 02:21, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
:Do it manually - copy and paste it to {{term|katen}}.

:: Moving Wiktionary entries is a completely different matter than moving Wikipedia entries: there are often hundreds of languages that might have a term spelled the same way, so simply moving the whole page won't work when there are terms in other languages on the same page. I don't know of any more elegant way than Metaknowledge's method for those. For cases where there aren't other languages under the same spelling, look for the unlabeled drop-down menu in the upper-right-hand corner, which will show its options if you hover your mouse over it. Move is probably the only option you'll see there. You would select that and follow the instructions. Just remember that we only use redirect pages when we're pretty certain that no other language will ever have a term to be added with the same spelling- in other words, not often (see [[WT:REDIR]] for a discussion).

:::Though there is an "elegant" way of preserving the edit history, a back-reference on the talk page of [[[[katen]]]] to [[[[katon]]]] and in the edit summary is much less difficult of execution.

:* Has there ever been any talk of organizing things differently, where each language has its own subpage and the main page under the lemma spelling just consists of transclusions of those subpages?  Eg., for [[[[same]]]], you'd have a tree structure like:
{| align="center" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170,170,170)"   
| 
<samp>same</samp>
:same/en
:same/eo
:same/ja
:same/no
:same/sv
|}
:: Each subpage would be the entire entry for that language, L2 language headings on down.
:: And then the [[[[same]]]] page itself would consist of wikicode like the following:
{| align="center" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170,170,170)"   
|
<code><nowiki>{{{{PAGENAME}}/en}}</nowiki></code>

<code><nowiki>{{{{PAGENAME}}/eo}}</nowiki></code>

<code><nowiki>{{{{PAGENAME}}/ja}}</nowiki></code>

<code><nowiki>{{{{PAGENAME}}/no}}</nowiki></code>

<code><nowiki>{{{{PAGENAME}}/sv}}</nowiki></code>
|}
:: This way, edit histories stay with the entry for a specific language, and that subpage can be moved as needed to a different lemma page, while keeping its edit history.
:: Implementing such a structure at this point might entail quite a bit of server time, but (in my no-doubt profound ignorance) I don't think it would be that difficult to implement if starting from an XML dump. -- Curious, [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 07:18, 22 July 2012 (UTC)

==A question on neologisms==
In Latvian, a number of words that didn't exist before were introduced into the language in the mid-to-late 19th century by certain authors (among which the most important was [[w:Atis Kronvalds|A.

I placed them in a new [[:Category:Latvian neologisms]], but now it occurred to me that they aren't neologisms by the definition in the Appendix -- these words have existed for over a century, and are no longer felt as 'new'. I suppose this makes 'neologism' the wrong word for them; but how should I name their category? Are there other such cases here at Wiktionary?

:I think massive amounts of Hebrew would fall in that category, and some languages (for example, [[Tok Pisin]]) are even more recent.

:I would recommend also making a guess about the PoS. After all, if you can come up with a valid definition, you have some knowledge about the word. If your definition is a synonym, what PoS does the synonym have? For a longer definition what PoS is the head of the definition? If you have a non-gloss or functional definition ("Used to ...."), it is usually harder. In English, many of the hard-to-classify words end up being called adverbs.

== A question on the (Latvian) transliteration of names ==
I've recently created [[:Category:lv:Transliteration of German surnames]] (in Latvian, in order to be adapted to the Latvian declensional system, all non-Latvian given names and surnames must be transliterated and slightly changed; so Edward Brown becomes Edvards Brauns, etc.). I created it with {{template|topic cat}}. I noticed, however, that it was subcategorized under [[:Category:lv:Miscellaneous]], and under a hidden [[:Category:Topical categories without topic cat parent (language specific)]]; also, its parent [[:Category:Transliteration of German surnames]] didn't exist, and when I created it, it got categorized under [[:Category:Miscellaneous]], and under the hidden [[:Category:Topical categories without topic cat parent]]. None of this happened with the (already extant) [[:Category:lv:Transliteration of English surnames]]. Why the difference? Should I do something about that? Or should it stay like that? (For Latvian, there should in theory be as many 'Transliteration of LANG surnames' and 'Transliteration of LANG given names' as there are languages, although for some minor languages I'll bet there still is no official transcription policy. Is that a problem for the category tree?) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 14:43, 24 July 2012 (UTC)

== Is Baltic a family? ==

I thought that the linguistic consensus nowadays was that the Baltic languages are a paraphyletic group. That is, they are those Balto-Slavic languages that are not Slavic. Is this true, or are the Baltic languages a separate branch with a common ancestor later than Proto-Balto-Slavic? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:02, 29 July 2012 (UTC)

:: Way to give a no-answer... :/ {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:27, 29 July 2012 (UTC)

: That was my impression, too. Wikipedia cites a study of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology as being sort of the clincher for the modern consensus. There will always be those who say that the similarities are due to contact at an early stage, or to both Baltic and Slavic being very conservative, and thus sharing many inherited features lost in other branches. There are also those who say that Western Baltic/Old Prussian, Eastern Baltic, and Slavic are all independent branches of Indo-European. I'm sure there are diehard Slavic partisans who, for political reasons, can't stand the idea that Slavic came from from within the Baltic languages. Of course, my only contact with actual experts in the field dates back to the days when Balto-Slavic unity was a minority view that was just starting to gain acceptance, so my opinion doesn't count for much.

:: From a little personal investigation (and a conversation with Kortlandt at Leiden), I also got the understanding that Baltic is indeed now considered paraphyletic. I have, however, been making references to Proto-Baltic, since the source I cite for Latvian etymologies, K. Karulis' ''Latviešu Etimoloģijas Vārdnica'', does make use of Proto-Baltic as an intermediate step between PIE and the Baltic languages, and since I'm not a specialist I cannot disagree with the source. I suppose someone someday will endeavor a Balto-Slavic (or simply Baltic?) etymological dictionary with reconstructed PBS forms that can be quoted; at that moment, I suppose the Latvian etymologies here will have to be updated. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 00:33, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
::: Would you happen to know if there any significant differences between Proto-Baltic as it is given in existing material, and reconstructed Proto-Balto-Slavic?

:::: Hmmm... All I have on Proto Slavic is Comrie's "The Slavonic Languages", which, despite the extensive chapter on PS historical phonology, is clearly far from sufficient. No, I can't tell. I expect PBS to look more like PB than like PS, but then again I don't think PB = PBS (look at what happens with PIE when one simply adds Hittite). (Even the [[w:Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Wikipedia article on PBS]] only mentions an online article by Kortland, on historical PBS phonology, and a work in Croatian about historical Croatian grammar... I think we'll have to wait for more detailed work on, hopefully an etymological dictionary of, PB. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 13:00, 30 July 2012 (UTC)

== Translation of an inscription on an old walking cane ==

I am requesting a translation of a small engraved inscription on an old walking cane.  I believe it is in German.  The cane was found in the basement of my sisters  house, origin unknown.  I am new to this site and to computer  usage. (gasp!). The inscription is as follows-(as best as I can read it, tarnished).      A. Schieman. Zum 76.

== Why is written French not with null‐subjects? ==

Can somebody please explain to me why written French almost never uses null‐subjects? It makes sense for speaking since many verbs have inflected forms which are homophones, but in orthography it is considerably obvious, isn’t it? --[[User:Æ&#38;Œ|Æ&#38;Œ]] ([[User talk:Æ&#38;Œ|talk]]) 11:09, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
: Orthography usually follows speech. It would probably be very strange for a language to differ syntactically in such a fundamental way between the spoken and the written form. Another reason may be influence from Frankish, as the Germanic languages are/were not usually null subject languages, even though the older languages had enough inflection to infer the subject from the verb. But that of course just moves the problem... why weren't the Germanic languages null subject languages? That I don't know. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:37, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
::But everybody knows that French orthography is not written the way it is spoken.<br/>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language#Spoken_Finnish Spoken and written Finnish tend to differ], so the potential exists. --[[User:Æ&#38;Œ|Æ&#38;Œ]] ([[User talk:Æ&#38;Œ|talk]]) 21:37, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
::: True, writing is usually more conservative, but the split between (more progressive) speech and (more conservative) writing only really starts to appear when enough people start writing that there starts to be a need for a standard. And even then, the standard is usually rather 'up to date' when it is formed, and only once it has been in place long enough to be able to 'set in stone' older, now-perceived-as-conservative forms of the language, does a split become apparent. It's obvious that the written standard for French has existed for quite a while, but even in the older forms of the language, before writing became standardised, subjects were not dropped (that I am aware of), so that can't be the source. The standard seems to have been formed with French already having lost its null subject-ness. So we would have to look to something that happened before that, and it seems Frankish is a likely explanation. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:59, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
::::Actually it was pretty common to drop subjects in the Old French period. Example from the French Wikisource [[s:fr:Tristan (Thomas d’Angleterre)]] "Sa nef ai veüe en la mer." (no personal pronoun je/jeo/jou etc.). The only thing I would add is French has a lot of homophones with respect to conjugated verbs; joue/joues/jouent for example. So in speech je joue, tu joues, ils jouent all sound different, joue, joues and jouent all sound the same. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 10:57, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

== Some questions regarding Gaulish ==

I have obtained a dictionary of Gaulish which seems to be very well written, but I have some questions before I begin to use it to improve the Gaulish section of Wictionary:
# The Gaulish was written in both Latin and Greek scripts, but the dictionary provides Latin transcription for all. Should I include only the Latin version in the entry, or it would be recommendable to trace back to the inscription it was taken from to find, whether it was originally written in Greek or Latin and then list one of the variants as a ''spelling variant of X''?
# Some of Gaulish lexems are hard to "deinflectionise". What I mean, even the author of my dictionary has given bare roots instead of full nominative forms for many words, as they are either obscure or hard to reconstruct. As a result, the Gaulish word for plain is given as ''acito-'', not as ''aciton'', ''acitos'', ''acitona'' or whatever else expected. Should I put these words in the main namescpace or in the Appendix namespace?
# When it comes to Proto-Celtic etymology, how should I link the reconstructed roots? Should they be in the main namespace or in the Appendix namespace?
I'd be grateful for any answers. [[User:Bli med|Bli med]] ([[User talk:Bli med|talk]]) 14:32, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

##Some languages are written in multiple scripts, sometimes concurrently, sometimes at different periods. You can make entries for the Roman spelling and you don’t have to try to find the Greek spelling. You could use a part-of-speech template like we do for Serbo-Croatian or Hindi-Urdu entries that lets you enter a term in one script, and if and when someone gets the other script, it can be added subsequently.
##''acito-'', etc. in the main namespace.
##Proto-Celtic reconstructions should be in the Appendix namespace, as we do for Proto-Germanic (see [[:Category:Proto-Germanic language]]). [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 19:03, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

:: [[abalo-]] - is that correct, then? [[User:Bli med|Bli med]] ([[User talk:Bli med|talk]]) 20:34, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
::: I am not quite easy with listing words as bare stems when the nominative is known or inferrable. That is an o-stem noun isn't it? Wouldn't it end in -os or -on then (which I believe are the masculine and neuter o-stem endings)? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:40, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
:::: Yes, it would, however, it would be original research if we put either of them, as they're not attested anywhere in nominative/accusative, and trying to guess is beyond the scope of a dictionary, I think.  [[User:Bli med|Bli med]] ([[User talk:Bli med|talk]]) 22:22, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
::::: But this isn't Wikipedia. We don't have any rules about original research, in fact without original research we could not do most of the necessary work of [[WT:RFV]], [[WT:RFD]] or [[WT:TR]]. And we don't consider a word stem in another dictionary to be an attestation either. The only reason I could think of for citing words in bare stem form is if that is the established practice in the field, and is to be expected by students of Gaulish who want to use Wiktionary for their work. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:49, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::: Then, that's the practice and guideline of most dictionaries and (relatively rare) academic works on Gaulish that when the nominative is unknown, the word is left as bare stem. [[User:Bli med|Bli med]] ([[User talk:Bli med|talk]]) 01:17, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::: That seems reasonable... it's what is done for other languages as well. But usually, the nominative can be inferred from attested forms, and if there are several possibilities, they are often all listed. I believe we do that for Gothic already. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:24, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: No one cites such forms, though, and they might give a false impression of being attested. Gaulish studies do not require full reconstruction - the language is dead, has left no direct descendants and - contrary to Gothic - is scarcely used in comparative studies and etymological research. Simply, it's easier and more accurate for me to follow already stabilised scientific conventions and leave the bare stem as a headword, possibly create redirects from all possible nominative forms (in case of [[abalo-]] that might be either O-stem *''abalos'' or, more likely, ''*abalon'', or even nasal-stem ''*abalo'', which is suggested by further development of "abalo-based" toponymy in Latin and Romance), and stating in "Notes" section that the word was left in the stem form because there are more alternatives to the basic form. I would say that's clearer solution which seems to be fair to potential users. Last but not least, in case of Gaulish, the problem of lack of base forms refers not only to nouns, which are somewhat easy to reconstruct, but also to verbs, where no infinitive was preserved and there is no verb with complete preserved inflection.

== Since you're already talking about Gaulish ==
I've wondered about entering some words mentioned in my copy of K.K.'s Latvian Etymological Dictionary for some extinct languages (Old East Slavic, for instance; perhaps Gothic). But since this is not a primary source for them (they are cited from other dictionaries, usually etymological dictionaries), I thought this would be unwise -- I don't have the original sources. I did go ahead and create a few Old East Slavic entries from the material in LEV (e.g., {{m|orv|стькло}}, {{m|orv|весь}}, {{m|orv|краса}}), plus one Gothic word ({{m|got|𐍅𐌴𐌹𐌷𐍃}}), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. (To mention one detail, I can't tell which declension class a given word belongs to, and the LEV, which is oriented towards Latvian, doesn't mention that, so I couldn't add any inflection templates.) What do y'all think? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:34, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
:I trust your judgment, but I would generally vote against. Being conversant in English and Latin, I know too well how even the best English dictionaries (cough cough, OED) cite etymologies that link back to nonexistant, hypothetical Latin terms or terms that were extremely rare without marking them as such or terms that were only used in medieval times or terms that were actually belonging to a whole different inflection pattern (and thus the wrong lemma)... the list goes on.<br>So feel free - but only if you know about the language enough and you can find a citation or a reference in a scholarly work specifically about that language. --[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 05:23, 10 August 2012 (UTC)
:: I can help with Gothic. Some time ago, I created romanisation entries for all Gothic words in [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Bible,_Gothic,_Ulfila]. So you can check [[:Category:Gothic romanizations]] if you need to know if a term is attested. That doesn't mean a term that is not in there doesn't meet CFI; sometimes the lemma isn't attested but inflected forms are. It is still a good start though. As for inflection tables, you can add {{temp|rfinfl|lang=got}} to the entry, and maybe also {{temp|attention|got|(reason)}} if you are unsure about something. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 09:42, 10 August 2012 (UTC)
::: I tend to agree with Metaknowledge above, in priciple. But I note that the Old East Slavic pages seem not to come from any source; they're apparently also occasional creations (there are only eight pages at [[:Category:Old East Slavic nouns]], and three or four of them were created by me; the others, apparently by Ivan Štambuk in 2008). I'm not going to add massively to that category, only an occasional OES word when I see one mentioned in the LEV; the need for someone to look at those entries and revamp them remains clear. As for Gothic -- thanks for the help, CDC. Now, the attested mentions of Gothic in the LEV are in romanized transcription; I added a page in the Gothic script only because I thought that, since the romanized version exists, then the Gothic script one also should. Is this a correct assumption? Can I go ahead and create a new Gothic page in the Gothic script every time I see a Gothic cognate cited in my LEV that corresponds to a romanized form already present here at Wiktionary? (I don't want to do this systematically, only every now and then when I find a Gothic cognate in the LEV; my main concern right now is with Latvian words.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 16:08, 11 August 2012 (UTC)

== Latvian [[viens]] ==
I've just added a plethora of new senses to that word, and I'm in doubt with respect to certain English translations (I'm not a native speaker). Especially sense #4: do you call the last digit of a number ''unit'' (as in Portuguese), or ''one'' (as in Latvian)? Or is it something else?

== Latvian diacritics: cedilla or comma? ==
Wikipedia lists Latvian under [[w:Cedilla|cedilla]] for the some palatalized letters: [[Ķ]][[ķ]], [[Ļ]][[ļ]], [[Ņ]][[ņ]], [[Ģ]][[ģ]] . But as far as I can see, the diacritic never actually touches the body of the letter; and in the case of lowercase [[ģ]], it is actually written above the letter rather than under it. In case there are any diactric specialists here: should I call it a cedilla, or a comma? And, in either case, is it really the same diacritic when it is placed above the ''g'', or does it become some sort of [[spiritus asper]]? (I'm creating the pages for Latvian diacritics, and I've called this one cedilla, but now I'm in doubt.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:22, 11 August 2012 (UTC)

: Rapa Nui (the language) is no doubt like most other Polynesian languages in having a very pure 5-point continental vowel system, with the accent on the second-to-last syllable except when the last vowel is long. That means that pronouncing it as if it were Spanish would give you the correct vowels most of the time.

:Because the term [[Rapa Nui]] hasn't really penetrated very far into the English language, it hasn't been truly anglicized: if you've encountered it outside of a dictionary or encyclopedia, chances are that you've heard it from an academically-influenced source like a documentary, or you're well-enough-versed in Polynesian cultures to be able to figure out the authentic pronunciation.

== [[jitney]] ==

When I was a kid in a Catholic school...we had a "jitney" lunch once a month.  I believe it cost a quarter.
The lunch consisted of a hot dog, chips, carrot sticks and an 8 oz. carton of milk (chocolate or white).

This was in the late 50's and early 60's. {{unsigned}}

My question:  How did this term get assigned to this type of lunch offering....was it because, when originated, the school lunch only cost a nickle?
:By our current interpretation or [[WT:CFI]], [[jitney lunch]] would seem to be includable because its meaning is not transparent what it means to a person with a passing familiarity with English. OTOH, if we can find evidence of a ''good jitney cigar'' or a ''jitney beer'' that would suggest that jitney probably meant ''five cents'' in this context. There are [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=%22jitney+lunch%22&btnG= some hits] at Google Books for ''jitney lunch'', probably enough to convey meaning.

==Etymology sources & general consistency==
Just out of curiosity, what is the main source for the Proto-Indo-European reconstructed protoforms in the Appendix? Is it Pokorny? Are Gamkrelidze & Ivanov taken into account? (Shouldn't the sources be listed in the PIE pages in the Appendix, by the way?) Also, on a more specific matter: what do people here usually do when sources differ on the exact reconstructed protoform? My trusty Latvian Etymological Dictionary, for instance, gives me PIE {{m|ine-pro|*wel-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*ul̥-}} as the source stem for Latvian {{m|lv|vilna||wool}}, with an extra suffix {{m|ine-pro|*-nā-}}, and then mentions the proposal of comparing it to the stem for "water", yielding {{m|ine-pro|*l̥-nā}}, {{m|ine-pro|*Hl̥-nā}}. Here at Wiktionary, however, I see the "wool" family being traced down to the laryngeal-happy form {{m|ine-pro|*h₂wĺ̥h₁neh₂}}, apparently {{m|ine-pro|**h₂wĺ̥}} + {{m|ine-pro|*-h₁neh₂}}. How should I deal with the difference between these forms and the ones in the LEV in the ==Etymology== section of {{m|lv|vilna}}? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 01:45, 16 August 2012 (UTC)
: There are various sources. I haven't always been consistent in adding references but I've been trying to improve that now. Something in particular that has bothered me about the way others have added references in the past is that they just list the references at the bottom but don't say which part of the entry came from which one. So I've been adding <nowiki><ref></nowiki> tags at particular points within the entry to show that that bit, in particular, comes from that reference. Look at {{l|ine-pro|*bʰer-}} for example. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 10:16, 16 August 2012 (UTC)
::  That's quite impressive. I hope all PIE Appendix entries will evolve into something like that... If I had a more recent source (all I have now is Buck's Dictionary of Synonyms, which is old as a source), I would help you. Meanwhile, I wonder what to do with differences between reconstructed forms in etymology sections. I've run into a number of cases in which different ===Etymology=== sections in cognate word entries gave different PIE reconstructions  for the same item. Perhaps we should keep the original source spelling (if the entry cites a source) but still link it to whatever form Wiktionary has in its PIE appendix? Or is it better to change it to match said form? Or to leave it unlinked? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:53, 18 August 2012 (UTC)

== coffee tables ==

how did coffee tables get their name?

:Around 1780 in England, the popular low-back sofas were sometimes used in conjunction with '''sofa tables'''. The sofa tables were designed to stand to the back of the sofa. A candle could be placed upon them and they could be used to support a book or a cup of tea or coffee between sips. These sofa tables were the predecessors of the modern coffee table. In 1868, a table designed by E. W. Godwin and produced in quantity by William Watt and Collinson and Lock was listed as a '''coffee table''' in ''‘Victorian Furniture’'' by R. W. Symonds & B. B. Whineray, and also in ''‘The Country Life book of English Furniture’'' by Edward T. Joy. That’s how they got their name. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G.

== Old Church Slavonic: what is it? ==

I noticed that some OCS entries list all Slavic languages as descendants of that term. Others list OCS among the South Slavic languages. But I also found a book that says it isn't really a member of any of the three Slavic groups because it is an artificial literary language that was used across the Slavic language continuum. So what is it? Is it the ancestor of all Slavic languages, is it the ancestor of South Slavic? Is it South Slavic or just 'general' Slavic? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 13:01, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
:It's definitely not the ancestor of all the Slavic languages and shouldn't be treated as such. It is a South Slavic language, and some authors refer to it as "Old Bulgarian", which is about as accurate as calling Old Norse "Old Icelandic". Although it shouldn't be treated as the ancestor language of all Slavic languages, a lot of Slavic languages (especially those spoken by traditionally Orthodox rather than Catholic ethnicities) have a large number of loanwords from OCS. So if, for example, a Russian word is said to come from an OCS word, it might be true (because it's a Russian loanword from OCS) or it might not be true (because someone has confused OCS with Proto-Slavic). It all depends on the word. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 13:36, 18 August 2012 (UTC)

:::::As I understand it, OCS was the first standardized written Slavic language, and the standard was set in the 9th century based on all the dialects of Common Slavonic at the time. And Slavonic was then just a single language with a range of mutually intelligible dialects. So it is sometimes convenient to say that a Russian word has descended from OCS when it actually descended from an unwritten Russian dialect of Slavonic that was almost the same as OCS. After OCS was made a standard literary language for the Slavic peoples, it began to diverge into dialects, so that there came to be a Bulgarian dialecct of OCS, a Russian dialect of OCS, etc. [[User:Stephen G.

If you have the information that it does (i.e., if you know it's a borrowing from OCS), then this should  be mentioned; otherwise, the PS mention will be sufficient.

:: Cornish was revived about 100 years ago and remains endangered along with Scottish Gaelic and Irish. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glv Manx] went extinct in 1974 but people continue to learn it. Basque and Māori are probably safe as is the case with Cherokee. Aragonese, Inuktitut and Faroese have limited populations. Yiddish is probably fighting an uphill battle, but people continue to study and use it, at least in the US. Old English and Latin are certainly dead, but there are people who use it and "introduce" modern words. Aramaic and Occitan are endangered. That's more or less my take.
:: You can check the [http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp Ethnologue] for language status and the [http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/ UNESCO language atlas] in particular for endangered language status. --[[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BB12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 02:48, 28 August 2012 (UTC)

Of course it doesn't have anything like the number of speakers it had 100 or 150 years ago, and probably never will, but it is still actively used in a fair number of Haredi/Hasidic communities, and the people in those communities tend to have large families, to remain isolated from the larger society around them, and to be highly [[endogamous]]. Yiddish will shift, and indeed already has shifted, from being a language of mainstream Ashkenazi Jewish culture to being a language of a small number of religious extremists, but I don't think the communities in which it's spoken are in any danger of dying out anytime soon, and as long as they survive, the language will. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 16:30, 28 August 2012 (UTC)

But when we depart from such situations, we do not have a good way of discriminating between alternative spellings and misspellings. Quantitative criteria may be the best we can do.

The typo ''hopefulyl'' has almost certainly been made by more than one author over more than one year, but (especially if those authors also used ''hopefully'' in the same works), it ''could'' still be a misspelling. "≥3 citations" and "over more than a year" are necessary but not sufficient conditions for inclusion.

== Are video games valid sources? ==
Video games often contain quite a bit of text in the form of dialogue or narration, and may in some cases provide citations of terms that are harder to cite elsewhere. Are they durably archived and considered valid sources? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:33, 30 August 2012 (UTC)

It's a very subtle difference that's hard to hear unless your ear is trained for it as a speaker of the language. If you don't listen closely, your brain fills in the blank interval with the perception of continued sibilance.

== Request for clarification: How strict is [[WT:CFI]] regarding attestation of spellings which vary slightly? ==

At [[Wiktionary talk:Requested entries (German)#To be removed from the list]], Longtrend and I are discussing ''{{l|de|Judenlaim}}'', an obsolete spelling of ''{{l|de|Judenleim}}''. [[Citations:Judenlaim]] exhibits the extent to which it is attested (''i.e.'', there is one citation each of the spellings ''Judenlaim'', ''{{l|de|Juden-Laim}}'', and ''{{l|de|Juden laim}}''); there may be other citations, but they would not be of the ideal type (they would be, ''e.g.'', citations of the word in non-German contexts, or in use in a bilingual dictionary). A strict reading of WT:CFI suggests that ''Judenlaim'' is not sufficiently attested (in any one of its forms) to warrant an entry for it. However, taking all the forms together, and allowing the less-than-ideal citations, it has six citations to support it. How should WT:CFI be applied in this case? Does it permit or prohibit an entry for ''Judenlaim''? [[User:I&#39;m so meta even this acronym|I&#39;m so meta even this acronym]] ([[User talk:I&#39;m so meta even this acronym|talk]]) 19:02, 5 September 2012 (UTC)
: Intuitively I would say these count towards the same thing. I suppose what counts here is that the "leim" part is written "laim" so that variety of that part of the spelling is sufficiently attested, even though there are different other varieties using that variant spelling of "leim". It seems like we would have to consider as attested the fact that "Judenleim" may be written with "laim" instead of "leim", that but any combination of "laim" with some form of "Juden" that is ''actually'' found as not attested. So we have an attested fact, yet no attestable words reflecting that fact. That seems kind of crazy... {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 19:06, 5 September 2012 (UTC)

:: You share my sense of the situation's absurdity, then. <samp>:-)</samp> Hyphenation and spacing seem like such minor issues, in contrast with a more significant spelling difference like a ''vs'' e. How have cases like this been handled in the past? Is there any precedent that we can follow? In the absence of it, I should be inclined to argue the case for the inclusion of ''Judenlaim'', or whatever form it is felt best to choose.

::: We could reason for allowing this without bending the rules too far. If a word is attested in a spelling that is obsolete, it technically is not part of the current modern language. Instead it would be part of a now-extinct older variety of the language, and so it would require only one attestation. I can understand if people are not terribly keen on allowing even misspellings that occur only once, but this is already the status quo for other extinct languages like Gothic and Old English. We should also consider systematic changes in spelling (either due to changes in spelling norms, or actual sound changes), such as ai > ei. Since it was (AFAIK) common to see a word now spelled with -ei- being spelled with -ai- in the history of German, the -ai- spelling is sufficiently common ''in general'', therefore it is also implicitly common ''for a given word'' even if for that word in particular there are fewer attestations. I would support, on this reasoning, an change to CFI that goes something like 'obsolete alternative spellings need only one citation if the proper/modern form is attestable, and if that particular change in spelling is common and well attested in other words'. This would imply that if there are enough words showing -ai- instead of -ei-, each one individually would need only one cite if the modern form with -ei- is attestable (via the regular 3-cite rule). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:30, 5 September 2012 (UTC)

:IMO, CFI prohibits an entry for Judenlaim if it is not attested in that exact spelling, ''especially'' if it is attested (three times) in some other spelling. After all, if a word is only attested in variant spellings, how are we to decide, descriptively (not prescriptively), what spelling should be the lemma?
:The kind of change to CFI CodeCat proposes might prove be difficult to implement, IMO, opening up debates about whether a term was changed in a particular way, and whether that way of change was common. (Should we have entries for -our endings of every word that ends in -or, because British and older English often spells -our what newer and American English spells -or? Is that different? Probably, but it's debatable...)
:If [[Judenleim]] is attested, why not just create an entry for it, and either:
:# give the citations of Juden-Laim, etc in the etymology: "attested in early documents in various spellings such as ''Juden-Laim'', {{...}}"
:# supply the citations of Juden-Laim, etc in that entry, like Widsith et al supply Middle English citations of modern English words in the modern English words' entries

:: Under my proposed change, if -our was (hypothetically) a common ''obsolete'' spelling variant of modern -or, and [[color]] had 3+ citations, then we would consider [[colour]] to be attested with only one cite. In the case of [[Judenleim]], which presumably has 3+ citations, then under my proposed change, [[Judenlaim]] (only) would be considered attested with the one cite given, because -ai- is a common obsolete variant spelling of -ei- in German. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:52, 5 September 2012 (UTC)

::: Regarding CodeCat's proposal in his post above (21:30, 5 September): How old does a variety of a language have to be for it to be deemed obsolete and for the more lenient standards to apply to it? Whilst there's a clear cut-off when you talk about "Gothic" or "Old English", the boundary keeps shifting in the case of your proposal. Does that mean that some turn-of-the-(nineteenth)-century terms that currently fail to satisfy WT:CFI's attestation criteria will be admitted in perhaps five or ten years' time? That being said, I think there's definitely something to be said for being guided in our considerations by general patterns of language development. For example, on the topic of -or/-our word pairs, the attestation of one should prompt us to search expectantly for the other, and to present any attestation of it as run of the mill for the English language. However, ''colo(u)r'' is, I think, a bad example: ''Color'' could be attested millions of times over; if ''colour'' had only one or two citations to support it, then it would be too rare for inclusion (in relative terms). A better example (I can't think of a good real one — perhaps ''artillo(u)r''?) would be one where the entire [[lexeme]] (lemma, inflections, spellings variants, etc. altogether) is supported by no more than, say, a dozen citations in total; in ''that'' case, a regular spelling variant with only one or two citations would be common enough (in relative terms) to warrant its inclusion. Also, concerning which form to lemmatise, it is worth taking note of those same general patterns of language development. Take a word which became obsolete in the sixteenth or seventeenth century. It is quite likely that in its case the majority of the citations available for it will be of spellings that no one would use nowadays; it is therefore more accurate a description of a word ''in the context of its language'' to lemmatise a rarer but more regular form.
::: All that, however, is somewhat beside the point when it comes to ''Judenlaim'' etc. Spacing and hyphenation in compound words merit very little importance to be attached to them. [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22juden+leim%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 ''Juden-Leim'' and ''Juden leim''] are attestable, too, showing complete paralellism between the forms of ''Judenleim'' and ''Judenlaim''. Surely, all this means that ''Judenlaim'' ought to be included.

::: I've just thought of an analogous case: Take [[:Category:Finnish terms with rare senses|a rare word in a highly inflected language like Finnish]], for example ''{{l|fi|kanoottikaksikko}}''. Should we expect each of its thirty-three declined forms to be supported by at least three citations? To require at least ninety-nine supporting citations for it would be a very onerous standard. Regular forms should be given some kind of pass or, at least, leeway. Consider, would we refuse to list a rare English verb's present participle because of lack of attestation, even though the ''-ing'' rule for its formation ''knows no exception''?

:::: I disagree that inflection is analogous to spelling variation; I also note that some verbs are only ever used in the infinitive ([[would]]) or in another word, and their nonexistent participles should not be included. Some (now often archaic) words are used in the imperative or some other form; checking if other forms are attested is a useful way of seeing which words fall into that category.
:::: If [[Judenleim]] is attested — and it is — no content is lost, no word fails to be covered, when we bar Judenlaim on the grounds that it is not attested. If you'd like to list Judenlaim with an appropriate {{temp|qualifier}} as an unlinked ("blacklinked") ===Alternative form===, go ahead; that is also the most I would suggest when obscure verbs are only attested with the ending -ize, or -ise, but not both. 
:::: Per [[WT:CFI]], "A term should be included if it's likely that someone would run across it and want to know what it means." If someone finds "Juden-Laim" in an old text and doesn't know enough German to know that the modern spelling is "Judenleim", I doubt they will know enough to search for "Judenlaim". If the only citations of "that spelling" vary so much in form that no one spelling is attested, then — no one spelling is attested, the "that spelling" I referred to in quotation marks earlier in this sentence doesn't exist (it's "those spellings", multiple, no one of which is common enough to meet CFI). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:41, 9 September 2012 (UTC)

::::: Hmm. I understand your rationale. Is the current state of ''{{l|de|Judenleim}}'' acceptable? Presumably the presence of "Judenlaim, Juden-Laim, Juden laim" in the entry will make ''Judenleim'' the first search hit returned by searching for any one of the ''-laim'' forms, so this solution makes the situation clear enough.

NZ English background
Image 1 I concur this is called a sleigh as is any animal drawn conveyance with an undercarriage. Primarily for the transport of passengers
Image 2 this is called a sled and can be animal or man drawn for transporting passengers or cargo but runs directly on the snow or ground. If it was animal drawn and for cargo only it could also be called a sledge but that is rather archaic.
Image 3 This is a sled at present although US English usage of toboggan is creeping into use through TV.
Image 4 This is a sleigh as it has a raised undercarriage. But it is often unknowingly incorrectly called a sled or toboggan

::No, it isn't.  The "oblique" case means "non-nominative", and was the result of syncretion of the various non-nominative cases in earlier forms of Latin.

== [[ham radio]] vs [[HAM radio]] ==
I am not certain of the process we should use to correct capitalization for proper and common usage of this term and other terms related to it.

[[HAM]] radio operators use the term capitalized to distinguish [[HAM]] (Ham Radio Operator) from [[ham]] (a piece of cured pork).  I am not certain how most people refer to amateur radio operators, but at least in the context of [[ARRL]] and other organizations, the letters are always capitalized.

In addition, several places I have seen {radio slang} used as a qualifier/template, and I'm not sure how to go about formalizing the differences between what ANY radio operator (including [[CB]]) might say and what a licensed [[HAM]] would say.

NOTE: HAM radio is international, and while it may have fallen out of common use amongst techies (because of cell phones and the internet), it is still popular in some circles.

As an licensed operator myself, I'm certainly qualified to make the distinction, but not sure how to go about the process within Wiktionary. --[[User:Jacecar|Jacecar]] ([[User talk:Jacecar|talk]]) 08:49, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

*Hmm. Looking through Google book search, I can't find any spelling with all capitals (for HAM). "Ham radio magazine" has everything in capitals on its title page, but that's just stylistic orthography, not a proper spelling. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 18:56, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

*Interesting. I did several searches and noticed the same thing. I guess my understanding of the term was flawed. I should have done my homework before asking.

: It's etymology/origin is from the 1850-1870's '''G. M. Dodge's ''The Telegraph Instructor''''' where it was defined as "''Ham: a poor operator. A 'plug.'' '". I'd have to look up the exact issue to make sure, but apparently the definition preceeded the existance of radio itself.

: I will make sure we have the correct information in our definitions and cites, and then go forward with my other question, which relates to "slang". I guess I think of ''slang'' as a derogative and ''term'' as a positive, so I'd like to differentiate between ''radio slang'' you might hear on a [[CB]], like "''[[Breaker one nine]], this is the ''Rubber Duck'', [[puttin' the hammer down]]. Just passed me a [[bubble-gum machine]] flyin' northbound at the 40 [[yardstick]].''" and formal/official radio language, like "''CQ CQ, This is KB8SHZ, moble, listening on frequency.''" The former has no rules (or none that are followed) and the latter has entire pages of rules and regulations from the FCC and their sister organizations internationally. --[[User:Jacecar|Jacecar]] ([[User talk:Jacecar|talk]]) 20:40, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

== Ethnonyms which are both singular and collective ==

What's the best way of dealing with the huge number of ethnonyms (including almost every Native American ethnonym, like [[Huaorani]], [[Abenaki]] and [[Navajo]]) that are both singular (with a different plural, like Huaoranis, Abenakis, Navajos) ''and'' collective (the Huaorani speak a language unrelated to its neighbors, the Abenaki are trying to revitalize their language, the Navajo have distinctive customs)?

:This is a general feature of many English nouns that are used to refer both to an individual object and to a collective class of those objects: [[oak]], [[grass]], [[fish]], [[cat]].

:Normally when an entry consists of two or more words, each word is linked directly in the bolded headword under the POS heading. In this case, this could be done by typing <samp><nowiki>{{en-noun|head=[[non-exclusive]] [[list]]}}</nowiki></samp>.

What is the difference, in terms of what they should contain, between these two pages? And similar for other scripts, like [[Appendix:Russian alphabet]], [[Appendix:Cyrillic script]] and [[Wiktionary:Russian transliteration]]? I would imagine that the Appendix page should give information about the script; this is kind of encyclopedic, so it might be better to defer to Wikipedia. The Wiktionary page should probably describe our policies with respect to the script, including transliteration. Are the Appendix pages really redundant? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 12:43, 16 October 2012 (UTC)
: My understanding is that Wiktionary pages are for editors, while Appendix pages are for users. I honestly don't see the purpose in the [[Appendix:Cyrillic script]] page but the other two I think are necessary. Similarly, I don't see the purpose in [[Appendix:Gothic script]], but [[Wiktionary:Gothic transliteration]] is necessary to describe transliteration conventions to editors and I think there should be an [[Appendix:Gothic alphabet]] (currently a redirect) to describe the alphabet and the transliteration we use for users. --[[User:Wikitiki89|WikiTiki89]] ([[User talk:Wikitiki89|talk]]) 12:53, 16 October 2012 (UTC)

::: 10 billion years from now, when Wiktionary is finally finished (assuming no one will ever add anything ever again), the Wiktionary namespace should be able to be deleted, while the Appendix namespace should be entirely kept.

::: Yeah, I've never quite grasped this.

: I can’t speak surely for languages other than Portuguese but words formed with [[-íssimo]], even though they are also called superlatives, don’t have the same meaning as English words with [[-est]] (instead, they mean “extremely FOO”, “very very very FOO”).

== Gender as a context ==

What is the best way to indicate that different (but related) senses of a word have different genders?

:::I think you're thinking of the common names languages use for various flora and fauna. Those should be in the translations tables of the English common names.

In contrast, Navajo sometimes prefers its own <u>taxonomic</u> names for things, e.g. nv.WP uses ''[[:w:nv:Naaldeehii]]'', not ''Animalia'', for the kingdom to which ''Panthera leo'' belongs.

::::You misunderstand why we include some English terms on many of the Navajo pages.

Many of the Navajo pages give the Bilagáana name for the page (we even have a special template for the purpose), all for the same reason...because, due to economic, legal, and cultural pressures, few Navajo can read or write their own language (even though they can read and write English), and many no longer even speak Navajo. We try to make the pages useful to those Navajo who do not speak Navajo well, if at all, but who are interested in trying to learn it. On the Navajo pages, we give the terms such as "''Panthera leo''" because it is important foreign information, and it does not mean that it is a Navajo term or a term that Navajos use when speaking Navajo.

Ashkenic Jews from Russia that had come to Germany with the surname Kraft.  It also mentioned the family in the U.S. that own the food Corporation Kraft.  The most common being Kraft cheese.

Many changed the spelling from Kraft to Craft (although Craft was also described as being English from the British Isles).

*According to Ancestry.com - German (also Kräft), Danish, Swedish, and Jewish (Ashkenazic): nickname for a strong man, from Old High German kraft, German Kraft ‘strength’, ‘power’.

== Merged phonemes and allophones ==

There are many languages where, in certain positions in the word, certain phonemes merge allophonically into a new sound that is not a separate phoneme but only occurs as an allophone of the original phonemes. This can be stress-conditioned, for example in Catalan where {{IPAchar|/a/}} and {{IPAchar|/e/}} merge into {{IPAchar|[ə]}} in unstressed syllables. In (earlier) Old English, medial {{IPAchar|/b/}} and {{IPAchar|/f/}} merge into {{IPAchar|[v]}}. What should be done with the phonemic transcription in this case? Should it reflect the historically original sound (even if it is no longer apparent or even reconstructable), or should the merged sound be treated as a new phoneme distinct from either of the original phonemes, despite being an allophone? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 16:07, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
: There has been a huge problem with this in Russian, mostly about whether a transcription with reduced vowels and assimilated consonants should use slashes or brackets. There is currently no consensus on this. Personally, I think the easiest way to solve this is to have a separate phoneme set in stressed and unstressed positions (and possibly other cases depending on the language). Another language where this really bugs me is Aramaic, where stops /b/, /ɡ/, /d/, /k/, /p/, and /t/ have fricative allophones [v], [ɣ], [ð], [x], [f], and [θ] in complementary distribution. The user who added the Aramaic entries insists on not using the fricatives in the phonemic transcriptions, but /sipˈrɑː/ is very misleading when the pronunciation is really [sifˈrɑː]. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 16:26, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
:: Dictionaries in general use phonetic transcriptions that are neither very broad nor very narrow. A good rule of thumb is that if an allophone has a separate IPA character (without using diacritics, superscripts, etc.) it's probably distinct enough to warrant transcription. Allophones that can be written only by means of diacritics, superscripts, etc., are probably close enough to the underlying sound that anyone familiar with the language will get the pronunciation right. This is only a rule of thumb, though; there are almost certainly exceptions in various languages. For languages like German where there's already a tradition of IPA transcriptions in dictionaries, we should probably follow those dictionaries' lead unless there are good reasons not to. (Thus Duden transcribes both {{m|de|Rad}} and {{m|de|Rat}} as [ʁaːt], and we should too.) In addition, Wiktionary has the luxury most dictionaries don't of having room to give both phonemic and phonetic transcriptions. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 21:43, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
::: We probably don't want to use {{IPAchar|[c]}} as a phoneme in English [[tricky]] though, so I don't think the separate character-rule is very useful. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:55, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
:::: It's not clear that it is in fact [c] though. I would sooner describe it as [kʲ].

:::::: That is true I guess, but rules of thumb can be easily abused if you don't know when to use them and when not. And it would be useful, I think, to have a more formalised guideline on this. In the end it would have to be language-specific, but to form a language-specific guideline there also has to be a general guideline first. For {{IPAchar|[c]}} in English it doesn't matter though, because that is an allophone of only {{IPAchar|/k/}} and of nothing else. My point was specifically about cases where distinct phonemes merge into one under certain allophonic conditions, and that is the only condition under which that phone appears. In other words, an allophone that is not [[injective]], so that one can say "this phone is an allophone" but not which phoneme it is an allophone of. Personally I think it would be good to treat such a merged allophone as a separate phoneme. So that would mean treating {{IPAchar|[ə]}} as a separate phoneme in the Catalan dialects that merge unstressed {{IPAchar|/a/}} and {{IPAchar|/e/}}. If the fricative allophones in Aramaic are injective I see no reason to treat them as separate phonemes, but if the fricatives appear in circumstances ''other than as allophones'' of the corresponding plosives, they should be treated as phonemes. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:16, 7 November 2012 (UTC)
::::::: I agree that that's one case where nonphonemic allophones should be transcribed separately, but I think that on a language-by-language basis there may be other cases where it's advantageous to transcribe separate allophones separately. Aramaic may well be such a case. If it's like Biblical Hebrew, then it's not that the allophonic relations themselves are noninjective ([f t x v ð ɣ] are allophones only of /p t k b d ɡ/ respectively), but the environments in which they occur that are not 100% predictable (generally after vowels unless geminated, but occasionally after consonants too under certain nonintuitive circumstances). 23:28, 7 November 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: Ok, so are there any environments where a plosive or fricative could both occur? If so, then they are not truly allophones after all, just merely in ''near''-complementary distribution. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:31, 7 November 2012 (UTC)
::::::::: Well, there are cases of free (possibly dialectal or diachronic) variation: "flames of" is [riʃfe] at [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2676.htm Psalm 76:4] but [riʃpe] at [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3008.htm Song of Solomon 8:6]. Otherwise you have to be aware of a word's morphological derivation in order to predict the distribution of stops and fricatives after consonants. (Kind of like in German, where you have to know where the morpheme boundaries in order to correctly predict [ç] in ''Frauchen'' but [x] in ''Rauchen''.) Some of the Persian names given in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3301.htm Esther 1:10] also have fricatives after consonants, but they probably don't really count as Biblical Hebrew words. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 23:46, 7 November 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::: Biblical Hebrew most likely developed this fricativization under influence of Aramaic which had it first. In Aramaic they are, or at least were at some point of the language, truly allophonic occurring in complete complementary distribution. As far as I know, in the cases where in Aramaic and Biblical Hebrew one of these fricatives occurs after a consonant, it is due to the loss of a vowel that had once been there at an earlier point of the languages, when they ''were'' truly allophonic. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:15, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::: So they were allophones but because the allophonic distribution was disturbed through sound change, they became phonemes. Like how [[Verner's law]] and [[umlaut]] became phonemic after the conditions that caused it were erased. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:23, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Except that there are very few cases where they contrast. My point is that at some point they ''were'' allophones but a transcription even from that time should still differentiate them.

== Turkish invented words ==

There's a group of people who believe that Turkish should be purified from foreign origin words. They hate widely used normal Turkish words like ''[[televizyon]]'' (television) or ''[[radyo]]'' (radio), because it's not "real" Turkish, and they invent new words for them (e.g. ''[[sınalgı]]'' and ''[[ünalgı]]'' respectively). Nobody really uses those words, it does not in any way represent Turkish, it's just invented. Associated websites are e.g. http://www.turkcesivarken.com/ and http://www.ingilizce.g3n.in/. They are using the wiktionaries to spread their invented words, too. [[:tr:Kullanıcı:Burudet88]] is such a user, who – after many warnings – got blocked at tr.wikt, but there are others too, as far as I know, mainly IP users, both at tr.wikt and here at en.wikt.

I guess I ''could'' RfV those words, but I feel like that's a total waste of everybody's time, because at best, maybe, possibly, one of those words could have a minimum of perhaps three cites, being the result of the active propaganda of this group of language purists. I feel like simply putting a {delete} template at such invented words. Comments? -- [[User:Curious|Curious]] ([[User talk:Curious|talk]]) 19:12, 11 November 2012 (UTC)

ingilizce.g3n.in contains both Turkish and non-Turkish origin words. For example http://ingilizce.g3n.in/index.php?soz=television there are both televizyon (french origin) and sınalgı (turkish origin). So how can anyone call this dictionary as 'purist'? Another dictionary TurEng (more famous than g3n.in) contains the word 'sınalgı'. This word has Kirghiz origin (you can google: "сыналгы" and see the results) and it was a suggested word for television by Turkish Language Association (see the article "televizyon" on Turkish wikipedia).

Weird, extremely rare, mentioned only, language-purist-only "words" like ''yötelmek'' are there to spread them. I'll repeat that no-one else, except you, has ever mentioned that "word" ''yötelmek''.

This is you: [//www.izafet.com/oopr/690475-pamidor.html] . There, you claim that "pamidor" means tomato, derived from Russian. And you say that it's also in other Turkic languages (Azeri, Turkmen, Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, other), written as "pomidor". Further, on my talkpage (tr.wikt), you write that it would be good to have more new words based on other Turkic languages, because that way, maybe about 200 million Turkic people could understand each other better. You like those Turkic languages, that's why "pamidor" is there in that dictionary.
::::* As CodeCat has said, that dictionary doesn't count as evidence anyway, not here at en.wikt, and also not at tr.wikt.

::::::While öksürmek itself is Turkish, using yötelmek is not purism. It is not an alternative word to another non-Turkish origin word. Pamidor is a Russian origin word, and using it in Turkish is not purism, too. I ask you again, why are you messing with Turkic origin words instead of words like [[zırtgel]]? It is true that these new words can help understand other Turkic dialects, and this is irrelevant to purism. Many of these words (such as "dikuçar" and "pamidor") are used in translated texts and you can find some of them on academic journals or perhaps on internet. I can see that some Turkish citizens who live in abroad can use this kind of words (e.g. '''Sonra mis kokulu hormonsuz çilekler, hormonsuz hıyarlar, hormonsuz pamidorlar''' from 15.07.2003 dated forum post) and if you search these words by using different suffixes you can find more examples. --[[Special:Contributions/88.238.180.144|88.238.180.144]] 21:35, 19 November 2012 (UTC)

== Is it acceptable to add my company's name in the definition page for that word? ==

Dear all,

I have noticed that Wikitionary contains nouns such as "Microsoft" or "Google", which are company names. I am the founder of the company [https://iridize.com/?stStart=welcome Iridize], and I wondered whether it is considered good behavior to add a definition for "Iridize" as a noun which refers to the company. I assume that since the policy seems to be to accept company names as words this should not be considered unacceptable. Never the less, I prefer to ask before editing to make sure.

Thank you for your kind attention,

::: You would have to add at least three durably archived citations of the "use of the company name other than its use as a trademark" either to citations page or under the definition itself.

== Concatenation and hyphenation in American English ==

Hi where can I find a good guide to how words are conjoined and hyphenated in US English ?
I recently started reading a lot of Science Fiction in US Eng and the when and how of joining words together or where and how to use hyphens is driving me barmy. I am accepting of the use of strange seeming compound words in quotations eg. colour eg. "How does what would be a six month cram-course for a human with top of the line hypnocubes turn out to be three days for a, a Trek?" However it is hard to accept in the body (narrative)text eg. What he saw in the wall caused him to pump the gun live and to kick the latch-plate with the toe of his boot.

:I didn’t understand a thing you wrote after "I am accepting of". However, a good guide for hyphenation of U.S. English is [http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0395245214/ref=sr_1_cc_1_olp?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1352925129&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=0395245214&condition=used The Word Book], by Kaethe Ellis. {{ISBN|978-0395245217}}.

Thanks for the book recommendtion. the bit after 'I am accepting of' is just me trying to explain that I have no problem with characters speaking in a dialect or being portrayed as speaking poorly by using nonstandard contractions and spellings etc. but are having trouble when the narrative text is also in that dialect.

:Now, that book is just a long list of words with stress marks, hyphenation points, and concatenation hyphens. It doesn’t explain the logic or rules for it. American hyphenation is pronunciation-based, so the word [[present]], meaning gift, is hyphenated pres-ent (because "pres" comes closest to the actual pronunciation of the first syllable); the verb to [[present]] is hyphenated pre-sent (because "pre" comes closest to the actual pronunciation of the first syllable). The word [[knowledge]] is hyphenated knowl-edge (because "knowl" suggests a short vowel, while "know" would be a long vowel). As for concatenation, I have never encountered the rules for that, if there are any. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 21:43, 14 November 2012 (UTC)

== [[āre]] ==
For that (poetic) word, one of the examples I found was in a little poem (or song), which I translated into English; I am, however, again unsure (and would profusely thank native speaker input) about the first line, ''kalni dun un ielejas''. With ''kalni'' = "mountains, hills", ''un'' = "and" and ''ielejas'' = "valleys", we're left with the verb ''dun'', infinitive ''dunēt'', a noise verb, which my trusty Latvian-English dictionary translates as "to drone, to boom; (of thunder) to roll". But the sentence is about mountains and valleys; do they "drone", "boom", or "roll" in any meaningful sense?

: On Wiktionary, citations and quotations are more or less the same thing. Quotations are put in entries, citations are put on the citations page (see [[WT:CITE]] and [[WT:QUOTE]]). I think what you are looking for is a reference: a link to an external source that confirms a certain fact, like what is used on Wikipedia. For that, see [[WT:REF]]. However, as that page shows, references are not the primary means of verifying the meanings of words, for that we use citations of sources that show the word being used with that meaning, following our requirements at [[WT:CFI]]. A reference that supports a ''definition'' of a word is considered only a kind of courtesy or convenience on Wiktionary, and helps to give credence to a word but doesn't establish it as fact all by itself, like it might on Wikipedia; that is what citations are for. So you don't actually need to add a reference; although helpful and useful, it's not required for a basic entry. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:29, 15 November 2012 (UTC)

== Why can’t foreigners be used for citations? ==

When it comes to citations, works by authors who do not speak English on a native level are undesired. I was told that that is because they make [more] mistakes, which doesn’t seem like an adequate reason. Natives can make many mistakes, and foreigners can be correct about a lot of things, no?

Shouldn’t we delete entries like {{l|en|ze}} and {{l|en|herro}}, since they are from non‐Natives? --[[User:Æ&#38;Œ|Æ&#38;Œ]] ([[User talk:Æ&#38;Œ|talk]]) 03:56, 26 November 2012 (UTC)

:My understanding is that works by non-native speakers are not necessarily excluded—several famous English-language authors are non-native speakers—but works which contain errors or nonstandard spellings or senses are viewed sceptically and sometimes excluded. [[[[vacuüm]]]] and several entries like it were cited using mostly English texts written by Dutch speakers. The works otherwise spell things normally and use words with their regular meanings (the writing is professional quality), and ''vacuüm'' is unlikely to be a typo, but it is a pedantic spelling that Dutch speakers — whose cognate is spelled exactly the same way — could reasonably be expected to have employed intentionally. Thus, the word is tagged "chiefly Netherlands" and kept. In contrast, a work containing a line like "these is the reasonig I can go not today" is likely to be rejected if offered as a citation of "reasonig", regardless (or should I say ''regardress'') of whether it was written by a native or a non-native speaker. As you say, native speakers can make mistakes, too.
:"Ze" and "herro" are different from "vacuüm": native writers of English are often the ones who use those spellings, putting them into the mouths of foreign characters. In contrast, actual foreigners (e.g. people raised speaking French who now write in English) are unlikely to write "ze" unless using it the way English writers use it, i.e. knowing it's a nonstandard spelling and intending it to convey an accented pronunciation of the word.

:(after edit conflict) I wouldn't say "on a native level", except for pronunciation. I ''would'' say "fluent", though. I would have no problem using quotes from [[w:Joseph Conrad]], for instance, since his novels show an excellent mastery of English. Remember that usage is our main standard for inclusion, so we need to be sure we're accurate about what's actually used in a given language. Saying that [[become]] means [[receive]] just because German speakers tend to say things like "I want to become a hamburger" would be a very bad idea. We should, of course, make an exception for recognized lects that are the result of large concentrations of bilingual speakers in an area.
: As for your two examples: those are eye-dialect, which is how native English speakers characterize (or too often, caricature) the speech of those who speak differently. Some eye-dialect even goes so far as to be inaccurate, racist, and offensive to those whose speech is represented.

== Was dente nominative? ==

{{m|la|*dente}} was a nominative noun in Vulgar Latin, correct? --[[User:Æ&#38;Œ|Æ&#38;Œ]] ([[User talk:Æ&#38;Œ|talk]]) 02:38, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
: Probably not. Vulgar Latin still had a distinct nominative, which was retained into Old French. Old French has {{m|fro|denz}}, which was re-formed from the stem dent- + -s (z spells ts in Old French). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 02:41, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

::O.K., so if {{m|la|*dente}} is not nominative, what is it? Accusative? What would its nominative form look like? --[[User:Æ&#38;Œ|Æ&#38;Œ]] ([[User talk:Æ&#38;Œ|talk]]) 02:44, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
::: Probably accusative. The final -m wasn't pronounced in Latin, but instead it turned the previous vowel into a nasal vowel. The nominative was probably still ''dens'', or it could have been turned into ''dents'' already, or even ''dentus''?. I'm not sure what evidence there is to reconstruct it with, beside Old French. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 02:49, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
:I think your regional bias will determine it; VL was horribly pluricentric. Personally, in my favorite dialect subcontinuum, Gallo-Italian, I see nom. sing. *''dents'' and obl. sing. *''dente''. I think Classical ''dens'' is not out of the picture, but I think *''dentus'' is pretty unlikely, considering that the 2nd Declension is extremely well established and I know of no forms like *''dentu'' or *''dento'' off the top of my head for the re-interpreted oblique that one would expect to logically follow. One thing that does puzzle me is why the ''n'' did not drop out (''id est'' Italian *''dete'') if in fact it was a nasalized vowel as I would otherwise expect. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 05:34, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

: If this is for an etymology, though, should we really be reconstructing it? I mean, we are in the habit of adding reconstructed terms, but should we be creating reconstructed alternative forms of attested terms as well? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 13:41, 28 November 2012 (UTC)
:: Probably not. It occurs to me though, in light of my comment above, that the Vulgar Latin nominative should have been ''dēs'' (with an originally nasalized vowel), which would have given Old French *''deis'', later *''dois'', so attested ''denz'' really must be analogical from the oblique stem ''dent-'' with an ''-s'' readded in the nominative. The Vulgar Latin nominative has survived in French, Spanish and Portuguese in some personal names, such as Carlos/Charles, Jacques, and Marcos, as well as Díos/Deus. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 14:16, 28 November 2012 (UTC)
::: Wait, why would the nom. in VL be *''dēs'' exactly? Old Provençal and Old French adapt this sub-paradigm of 3rd declensional nom. sing.s by adding -s to the obl. stem regularly, and 2nd declensional examples like Marcos < Marcus (vs. Marco) and Díos < Deus (vs. Dio/Deo) don't really have much to do with it AFAICT. Why would we assume that (at least for Gallo-Italian) the VL was substantially different? (But thank you for the fricative bit, I clearly need to learn more phonology.) —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 02:29, 29 November 2012 (UTC)
:::: Because of the loss of -n- before fricatives in Latin. Just as ''mensa'' became ''mẽsa'' at first, so too ''dens'' must have become ''dẽs'' rather early on. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 03:12, 29 November 2012 (UTC)

== Related terms for compounds sharing one part? ==

I noticed that some entries that are compounds have related terms that include words which share one of the parts of the compound. For example, {{m|nl|zonnevlek||sunspot}} might list {{m|nl|zonnebloem||sunflower}} because both are compounds of {{m|nl|zon||sun}} and therefore etymologically related. Somehow, this doesn't really seem useful, especially if you realise that under this kind of practice, whatever terms are listed under the derived terms of {{m|nl|zon}} can be repeated as related terms of each of those. That would lead to a horrible duplication of information. So is this a good practice? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:19, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

: I think it would be more useful for [[[[zonnevlek#Related terms]]]] to include a note to see [[[[zon#Derived terms]]]]. One complication, though, is that some of our editors believe that ===Etymology=== and ===Derived terms=== should be strictly about ''diachronic'' etymology. The term {{m|nl|zonnebloem}} may be compound of {{m|nl|zon}} and {{m|nl|bloem}}, but does that necessarily mean that it's derived <u>from</u> {{m|nl|zon}}?

::Do you have an example of an entry that suffers from the problem you mention?
::For some terms that have very few relatives there is good reason to include in Related terms the few relatives that they have.

::When I was experimenting with using categories as a repository for derivations (an effort that foundered in part because it required squarely addressing both diachronic and synchronic etymology), I was thinking that it would afford a way of including comprehensive lists of derived terms and offer a ready path to cognates for users who were interested, without actually requiring effort to enter each related term under each related headword and without the burden of downloading such a list until a user demanded it and hit the category link.

: Yes. Just as all Indo-European languages can be considered dialects of PIE. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 12:47, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

::Usually we consider that a dialect of one language becomes a separate language when it is significantly incomprehensible to those who only speak the first language, and after it has been standardized (has definite rules of grammar, pronunciation, spelling, etc.) and politicized (begun to be used as the language of education and commerce). So no, the Romance languages are not dialects of Latin. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 18:47, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::The planet Earth could be considered flat (as opposed to spherical). It could be, but it’s not. I don’t think that sense of "could be" is meaningful and that’s why I do not think he meant it that way. Virtually everything ''could'' be considered virtually anything.

:::: For us to consider modern Romance languages to be dialects of Latin, we would have to redefine [[Latin]], [[dialect]], and/or the terms for all the modern Romance languages. The point is that Latin refers to the language as it was written and spoken a couple of thousand years ago. The modern languages have massively changed from that in many directions, so you would have to redefine Latin to mean what we now refer to as the Romance languages. And even if one considered this redefined Latin to be a macrolanguage like Chinese or Arabic, there's still the issue of all the child languages having their own identities as separate languages, each with their own standards and even governing academies. Also, unlike Chinese and Arabic, there's no common written standard, either. There's nothing really that unifies them but resemblances and the knowledge that they descended from a common ancestor.

::::: The definitions at {{m|en|dialect}} and {{m|en|Latin}} do not support your point. Also, many of them ''are'' mutually intelligible to varying degrees. There's just no cutoff point. Having written standards is also not a perfect way to distinguish them, since that would imply that every time a language changes its orthography, it becomes a different language. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 06:54, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

: The predecessors of the modern Romance languages were dialects of Latin, but I would say the modern Romance languages are not dialects of Latin, firstly because they're not mutually intelligible with each other or with Latin, and secondly because they're descendants of Latin and descent is (usually?) a separate relationship from dialectality. That's part of the definition of a "[[dialect]]" in relation to a "[[language]]" vs a "language" in relation to another "language".

== Peen ==

The description of "peen" calls it "the (generally spherical)end of a hammer opposite the main hammering end, used to flatten the ends of rivets."

1) The end of a ball peen hammer best described as "generally spherical" is not the peen end; it is the ball end. The peen end is mostly cylindrical. I am not certain why they called it the "generally spherical" end.

2) Most people who use a ball peen hammer use the peen end; very few use the ball end. Saying that it is opposite the main hammering end is misleading. {{unsigned}}

:FWIW, Merriam-Webster defines it as "a usually hemispherical or wedge-shaped end of the head of a hammer that is opposite the face and is used especially for bending, shaping, or cutting the material struck" and Dictionary.com as "a wedgelike, spherical, or other striking end of a hammer head opposite the face". I've added the labelled picture WP had to our entry. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 18:27, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

:The [[peen]] end of certain hammer heads ''is'' the end opposite the flattish face most commonly used for striking. Hammers can have, at least, a ''ball peen'', ''cross peen'', ''point peen'', or ''chisel peen''. I don't know for sure whether ''all'' hammerheads can be said to have ''peens'', so that, for example, the ''claw'' of a [[claw hammer]] could be called a ''peen''. Nor do I know whether a chisel peen is the same as a cross peen or whether a cross peen is oriented perpendicular to a chisel peen. ''Peen'' <u>seems</u> to have been a term restricted to hammers used for shaping metal, so that all the specialized hammers used in other trades are apparently not usually said to have ''peens''.

== Is there a template when adding a quote from wikiquote ==

I just added several quotes to [[endowment]] that I found from a wikiquote search.  It would have been convenient to have had a template that simplifed that process.  For example, if such a template were called <b><nowiki>{{excerpt from wikiquote}}</nowiki></b>, it would turn this:
:<nowiki>
{{excerpt from wikiquote|1985|Jonas Salk|Interview on ''The Open Mind''|[N]umber one: Learn to live with each other. Number two: try to bring out the best in each other. The best from the best, and the best from those who, perhaps, might not have the same '''endowment'''.}}
</nowiki>
into this:
:<nowiki>
#* '''1985''', [[q:Jonas Salk|Jonas Salk]], Interview on ''The Open Mind'':
</nowiki>
:<nowiki>
#*:[N]umber one: Learn to live with each other. Number two: try to bring out the best in each other. The best from the best, and the best from those who, perhaps, might not have the same '''endowment'''. 
</nowiki>
I'm not picky about the template name or other specifics from this example, but am interested in learning what if any templates exist that make it easier to leverage wikiquote when fleshing out a wikt definition.

== English noun character length ie NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ==

I need to know the minimum, average and maximum character length of the english noun. A table of this would be useful. Does anyone know where I can find this information?
: Length in what? Millimetres? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:29, 3 December 2012 (UTC)
: Minimum is 1 character (such as the name of vowels, like [[a]], [[e]], ... [[u]]), maximum is [[Appendix:Unsupported_titles/Protein|189,819 characters]]. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 02:32, 3 December 2012 (UTC)

so what is the average number of characters a noun would have.
If you know what is the percent distribution of the number of characters a noun would have in the english language
:The problem is, nobody knows. Different references have different boundaries between the different parts of speech- are verb forms that act as nouns counted? Which ones? What about adjectives that function like nouns? What about brand names? What about technical names for chemical compounds? Even with a precise definition, the language is always changing, and is in use by a significant portion of the world's population, with only a fraction of it accessible to any method of study. No two dictionaries will list the same number of anything.
: The English language is a huge, amorphous, unquantifiable, glorious mess. There have no doubt been plenty of statistical studies of English, and they're all no doubt no more than crude guesses. If you want to run statistical queries on Wiktionary's database (incomplete though it is- we only have 193,103 entries for English nouns at the moment), there are XML dumps free for the downloading, though I don't know the details.

::The average length of English words is six characters.

Thanks for your replies.
It sounds like english isn't that well understood and you can only really learn by using it with others
What I thought was a simple question doesn't have a clear answer.

I am happy though to view any statistical summary of single word nouns. ie for a single word noun what is the percent distribution of the length of the noun in number of characters with a limit to the noun size of 60 characters. I realise there are some nouns which will exceed 60 characters but they are rare enough to ignore for my purposes. Can anyone offer me these more limited statistical summaries. I will take anything

:All I can tell you is the average for English words which was used by the U.S. Government and most agencies that needed to count words or bill for words prior to the advent of software programs such as Word in the 1990s that count words automatically. That number is 6 characters per words for the English language, as I described above. There is no breakdown for different parts of speech.
:You could go to [[:Category:English nouns]] and copy all of the nouns into a program such as Word. Word could then tell you how many words were copied, and how many letters are in those words, and that would give you the average number that you are looking for. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 10:12, 3 December 2012 (UTC)
::But that would only give you the average length of every noun that exists - i.e. it would give a weighting of 1 to both {{term|house}} and {{term|completability}} even though the first is very common and the second very rare.

:::He said he wants the average number of letters for English nouns. That statement includes all English nouns, including common ones and uncommon ones, and it excludes running texts, which will be of mixed parts of speech.
:::Anyway, I think we have a greater percentage of the common words listed here than we do of rare words. I don’t think there would be an overemphasis on rare words, long words, or short words. It would be the average for all English nouns, each counted one time only (regardless of how common).
:::If you only want the average for words that have a certain frequency of use, then you can copy words from the [[Wiktionary:Frequency lists]], but those are not broken down by part of speech.

Thanks again for your comments.
My questions are not to answer idle curiosity. I need to determine the size (number of characters) for a word in a software program.
I can reduce the scope of the requirement to proper and collective nouns in the english language. Six characters won't be enough but thousands of characters is far too much. I don't have the luxury of a variable length. So what is the optimum number of characters? {{unsigned}}
: I’d say 35 if you want to be extra safe, but between 20 and 30 should do it.

== Scots [[baloo]] ==

I sing in the choir at my church, and we've been learning an arrangement of the old Scottish lullaby Baloo Lammy with Christmasy words. Some of the other choir members were curious about the title. So far, I've been able to figure out that "lammy" is just a diminutive for [[lamb]], and we have {{l|sco|baloo}} as a Scots word for [[lullaby]]. I'm curious, though, about where baloo comes from.

How to count in German, preferably to 999, or more?

I would like to see comprehensive and accurate rules for writing them. (i.e., not merely a list of translated numbers, for example, as it would only be partially helpful)

That is because I have to develop a script (in Unix shell) to automatically write numbers in German, for college. It should convert 26 into sechsundzwanzig, for example. I know how to write scripts, but I don't count in German.

:* The units: eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun.
:* The decades are generally formed by unit+''zig'' but 10, 20, 30 and 70 are irregular: '''zehn''', '''zwan'''zig, drei'''ß'''ig, vierzig, fünfzig, sechzig, siebzig (not *siebenzig), achtzig, neunzig.
:* The units 1-9 of every decade are formed as (number)+''und''+decade, but ''ein'' is used rather than ''eins'': einundzwanzig, zweiundzwanzig, dreiundzwanzig etc.
:** The numbers 11 and 12 are irregular: elf, zwölf. 13-19 are formed as (number)+''zehn'' (dreizehn, vierzehn etc), but ''sechzehn'' loses an -s-.
:* 100 is hundert. Multiples of 100 are expressed by number+''hundert''. Decades and their units are formed as number+''hundert''+(unit+''und'')+decade. For example 340 = drei|hundert|vierzig, 345 = drei|hundert|fünf|und|vierzig.
:* 1000 is tausend. The rules for thousands are the same as those for hundreds. For example 3456 = drei|tausend|vier|hundert|sechs|und|fünfzig.

: I hope this helps? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 19:56, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

:My suggestion:
* First set the code up to recognise the German terms for 1 (eins) through 20 (zwanzig) and for every 'round ten' (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90). Then, whenever a two-digit number is given that is not one of those numbers, convert its ones digit to the appropriate term (e.g. 6 becomes sechs) and follow that name with 'und' with no spaces before or after it (unless it is 0 or 1: those are special cases) and convert the tens digit to the appropriate round ten (e.g. 2_ becomes zwanzig). 
* If the one-digit number 0 is put in, recognise it as 'null'. If a more-than-one digit number is put in and the digit in the ones place is 0, ignore it and do not use 'und', either. Thus 42 becomes 'zweiundvierzig' but 40 becomes 'vierzig' (not 'nullundvierzig' nor 'undvierzig').
* If a more-than-one digit number is put in and the digit in the ones place is 1, recognise the 1 as 'ein'. Thus 21 becomes 'einundzwanzig' not 'einsundzwanzig'.
* Next, set the code up to recognise hundreds by doing something like this: 
*: Either: if there is any number other than zero in the hundreds digit (e.g. if the input is 120, 346, 982, etc), add 'hundert' to the front of whatever the result of your parsing of the tens and ones digits is, and add something in front of 'hundert' based on ''which'' digit is in the hundreds place: 'ein' (or nothing) for 1 (a special case either way), and 'zwei' for 2, 'drei' for 3, etc (identical to the terms used for those digits when they appear as the ones digit).
*: Or: hard-code all ten possible digits: if there is a 1 in the hundreds place, pre-pend 'einhundert', if there is a 2 pre-pend 'zweihundert', etc. If the number in the hundreds place is 0, ignore it. (You may also add 'und' after '...hundert'; see below.)

Pick one and be consistent, i.e. always go with 'einhundert' or always 'hundert' for the numbers 100-199, always omit 'und' or never omit it from three-digit numbers. Another _0_ example: 206 is 'zweihundert[und]sechs'. Compare 122, which can be 'einhundertundzweiundzwanzig', 'einhundertzweiundzwanzig', 'hundertundzweiundzwanzig', 'hundertzweiundzwanzig'.

I have a question regarding my submission of the word "partnersh*t."

This is a word I have written a book about and have identified as a syndrome in business partnerships. Many partnerships have failed due to partnersh*t. I teach workshops on this and have captured much attention because of it. This word will soon be in the lexicon. 

What is the reason for the second deletion? Was it because I inadvertently capitalized it?

I've read [[Appendix:Russian suffixes]] and am confused. Most suffixes there are compounds consisting of what is called "suffix" (суффикс) in Russian schools - a morphema belonging to a word in any case, number or person, and an ending which it requires in Nominative. Also, many "stable" parts are also compounds: e.g. [[-увший]] consists of [[-у]] (noun2verb suffix, in which [[-ну]] turns after root -н), past participle suffix [[-вш]] and single male Nominative participle and adjective ending [[-ий]]. Is it a normal practice and where can I read about it? [[User:Ignatus|Ignatus]] ([[User talk:Ignatus|talk]]) 20:29, 27 December 2012 (UTC)

== Slang for brands? ==

[[WT:BRAND]] isn't really very clear to me. It states that terms can be included if they have "entered the lexicon" but I don't really understand what that means. In the Netherlands there is a well known supermarket chain called [[Albert Heijn]]. As far as I know, that name isn't used to refer to anything other than that chain so it hasn't entered the lexicon anymore than any other brand name has done. However, there are also slang names to refer to the same chain such as [[Appie Heijn]] or just [[Appie]]. I presume that those slang names are includable, but would the proper name be too? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 13:09, 29 December 2012 (UTC)
: AFAIK, brand names are not included on Wiktionary unless they can be attested as generic nouns. Then again, [[AOL]], [[Starbucks]] and [[Rice Krispies]] haven't been removed, while [[QQ]], the instant messaging program used by 784 million people around the world was deleted on more than one occasion due to lack of citations. [[User:Tooironic|---&#62; Tooironic]] ([[User talk:Tooironic|talk]]) 01:06, 30 December 2012 (UTC)
:: But surely a slang name is part of the lexicon all the same? In a sense, [[Appie]] is not a brand because the owners of the supermarket chain didn't think of it, regular people did. But it is a name derived from a brand and refers to the same thing that the brand name refers to. So are things brands because of how they were coined, or because of what they refer to (i.e. is it the ''word'' or the ''meaning'')? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:13, 30 December 2012 (UTC)
::: Traditionally, we've considered slang names that are derivatives of brand names to be exempt from BRAND. For example, we've used Appie logic to keep {{term|Grauniad}}, {{term|Mickey D's}}, {{m|fi|Hesari}}, {{m|fi|Hese}}, and probably many more. There was also an attempt to use it to save [[Wiktionary:Requests for verification archive/2012/even more#QQ|the entry QQ]], although that got nowhere. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 04:31, 30 December 2012 (UTC)

We prevailed there for exactly the same reasons why a nickname would be kept here: because we were able to find published uses of the nickname referring to the product. IBM had a similar issue with [[Big Blue]], first ignoring the nickname use, and then reversing course and seeking to register it on the basis that the use of the term by consumers showed that it was associated with IBM's products. Again, IBM had to find published references using the nickname in this way. [[User:BD2412|<i style="background:lightgreen">bd2412</i>]] [[User talk:BD2412|'''T''']] 15:08, 30 December 2012 (UTC)

== Languages with difficult scripts ==

{{movedfrom|Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2014/February}}
I was astonished today to run into the word [[šambaliltu]] for fenugreek in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, which I knew by the Persian word {{m|fa|شنبلیله}} (our entry says it's transliterated shambalile, but I thought it was shambalila). I had no idea the word went all the way back to Akkadian. My first thought was: do we have it in Wiktionary? After looking at [[:Category:Akkadian nouns]], I still don't know.

Cuneiform is a complex script that very few people know how to read, and that most references don't use- but all our categories are arranged in character order with no transliteration shown. If you want to find a given word, you have to either: a) browse through all the entries, one by one; b) type the transliteration into the search box and hope it matches the one in the entry; or c) try to guess the characters in the name from the transliteration using some reference, and look for them in the category.

How can we improve on this? I know we can add a sort key to the category wikilink in each entry to make the categories list in transliteration order, and we can create transliteration-of entries ([[:Category:Akkadian nouns]] has exactly one of those). It would be nice to have an automatically-generated index of transliterations for each category, and/or have the transliterations visible in the category listing itself. The second option looks like it would require assistance from the developers, but what about the first? Does anyone have other ideas?

: On refreshing myself with Cuneiform, it's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#Transliteration a hard problem]. Akkadian cuneiform is a syllabary, but the normalised transcriptions (in Wiktionary, anyway) do not show the syllables which spell the word. (A·KA·AS·SA·PU·TU > Ákassaptu, as a completely made up example. More the point, a symbol may be read as Akkadian, Sumerian (which I think is shown by the differing transcriptions in parenthesis (Akkadian reading) and brackets [SUMERIAN]) or as a determiner. I don't think an automatic transcription is possible, much less fuzzy searching as described above. Moreover, I think that an Assyriologist needs to go through and normalise these, with a better description of what's going on. Something like 
:* '''Akkadian'''
:*: [[𒀀]] (mū) ''f.'' (''plural'')
:*:# water
:*: '''Usage notes'''
:*: Most often complemented with [[MEŠ]] (''link to whatever the cuneiform is for MEŠ'')
: Sumerian readings should be listed in the Translingual section. The Akkadian section would give variant transcriptions, possibly with a link to an appendix describing the process and conventions (such as transcribing in lower case for Akkadian readings, and UPPERCASE for Sumerian readings, which are not uncommonly combined within a word), and possibly even the transcription and the normalisation. The cuneiform would be a lemma, and the normalisation would also be a lemma, each linking to the other, but the diplomatic transcription, while given in both places, would not be a lemma. So...
:* [[𒋠𒍝𒆳𒋛𒀀]] ([[argamannu]] [SÍG.ZA.GÌN.SA5]) is a head line, which would link to 
:* [[𒅈𒂵𒌋𒌋𒉡]] ([[argamannu]] [ar.ga.man.nu]) and both would link to
:* [[argamannu]] which would require two transcriptions: ([[𒋠𒍝𒆳𒋛𒀀]] [SÍG.ZA.GÌN.SA5]) and ([[𒅈𒂵𒌋𒌋𒉡]] [ar.ga.man.nu])

:Jut to add my voice to the chorus: obsolete forms should '''not''' go in the headword line. We shouldn't clutter the line with information which is no longer useful and, by giving it prominence, suggest it is still usable*&nbsp;: I've known a couple of Germans who liked to use the 'goest'-forms of verbs because they couldn't stand that English wouldn't use as full a set of verb forms as German; they never realized (much like people who use ligatured spellings of "æqual", and much like the North Korean press office which famously only had outdated English-Korean translation dictionaries for a long time) how affectatious they sounded; we don't need to encourage more people to do the same. The [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/July#Inconsistent_mention_of_inflected_forms|last time the presence of obsolete forms on headword lines was discussed]], people seemed to favour creating conjugation tables for English verbs which would include the -eth and -est forms.

I think the solution there is to collapse the obsolete forms under a rel-top, and perhaps move the entire Alt forms section — whereas, collapsing part of a headword line, or moving the headword line to a different part of the entry, would be a bad idea. Also, I think that obsolete forms belong with other alt forms, and can (when in Alt forms sections) be segregated onto a separate line and labelled clearly, whereas obsolete forms listed as part of a single run-on headword line can't be labelled as clearly without making the headword line into two or more lines.<br> [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:43, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

::[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/July#Inconsistent_mention_of_inflected_forms|Discussion last year]] showed that there was interest in having conjugation tables for English verbs, and this discussion shows continued interest, so I've deployed a conjugation table on ''[[walk]]'' and ''[[talk]]'' (adapted from something CodeCat designed in the July 2013 discussion—I made some changes to which forms were displayed). See what you think. Obviously, we'll need another table to account for verbs that add, delete or change letters when inflecting, e.g. ''hate'', but that shouldn't be too hard, and per our usual practice, I expect that all the tables used in entries will end up being shells that use a single backend.

== Updating [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained/POS headers]] ==

This page is very important as far as policy/common practice pages go, but it's also rather out of date. We should bring it up to date, but I'm not sure what the current state of affairs is on everything. I know that there's a general consensus that "acronym", "initialism" and such are no longer acceptable. We've also deprecated "cardinal number/numeral" and "ordinal number/numeral" recently in favour of plain "numeral" (for cardinals that don't fit any other part of speech) as well as "adjective" for ordinals. But there's also "idiom" which I don't think should be allowed either, although I don't know if any consensus exists on that. "Participle" seems to be gaining some ground recently; all Dutch participle entries use it now.

We should probably also go through the "Other headers in use" list and see which ones we should try to track down and fix. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:09, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

:Indeed. If someone more technically adept than me could generate a list of all the POS headers that are currently in use (and, if it wouldn't be too taxing, a count of how often each header is used), that would let us know where we stand, as far as which headers are in use vs which are prescribed by WT:POS. <small>One way to generate a list of POS headers would be to generate a list of L3 headers and then just manually remove non-POS stuff like "See also".</small> In fact, a list of ''all'' L1, L3, L4, L5, etc headers (but not L2 headers — [[WT:STATS]] already has a list of those) which are in use, with information on what level they are and how often they occur, would surely reveal some typos and other things that we'd like to change. There shouldn't be any L1 headers. And I often notice "References" at L4 not inside a numbered etymology section. But I'm getting off-topic; I apologise.

== Part-of-speech sections with multiple headword lines, lemmas with form-of definitions on the same page ==

Occasionally I come across entries where there is a single part-of-speech header with multiple headword lines below it. An example is [[mensa]], in the Latin section. There are also many examples of this in Italian entries. Sometimes they are like the case of [[mensa]] where the second headword line is simply a form of the first, but I've also seen it used to distinguish masculine and feminine-gendered nouns with the same lemma form. I'm wondering what the general consensus is about entries like this. I personally think that this is wrong, and that these really should have their own headers. Masculine and feminine nouns are separate, they are not the same lemma, because they have (at least in Italian) separate types of inflections. But even the Latin ''mēnsā'' is not the same word as ''mēnsa''; they have different pronunciations and it's only because of an orthographic shortcoming that they end up on the same page. There's also a practical consideration: having "floating headwords" with no header before them is harder for bots to parse, especially when they are formatted using the obsolete "bold headword" formatting like ''mēnsā'' is. As the page is now, a bot that tries to parse that page will come upon what seems like a random bit of bold text in the middle of the list of definitions. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:26, 3 March 2014 (UTC)

:''[[mensa|Mensa]]'' should definitely not be formatted like it is, we should either remove the "'''mēnsā''' {{g|f}}" line (and perhaps also the following "# {{inflection of|la|mēnsa||abl|s}}" which simply points users to the page they're on) or give it its own ===Noun=== header. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 00:12, 4 March 2014 (UTC)
:: I don't think we should remove it, because it's pronounced differently from the noun above. There should be two pronunciation sections on the page, which implies two noun sections IMO. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 15:32, 4 March 2014 (UTC)

A question that's somewhat related is about form-of definitions that are homonymous with the lemma and therefore appear on the same page, under the same etymology/pronunciation section (often under the same PoS header too and listed as one of the definitions of the lemma, but not always). ''mēnsā'' is not an example, because its pronunciation differs, but the entry also contains a definition for the vocative singular. Again I'm not really sure if this is good practice. The main reason we create form-of entries in my opinion is to let people find the lemma, and also to give pronunciation information about each form specifically. But when the lemma is on the same entry already, and has the same pronunciation, there's not really anything to be gained from listing the form-of definition there. There would presumably be an inflection table on the entry, and that would show which forms coincide with the lemma form (these often appear in black bold, too). Please note that this doesn't apply at all to ''sublemma'' form entries. These entries would need extra grammatical information, such as their own inflection table. In those cases we should create sections for both, like on {{m|nl|vergeten}}, which is both a verb (infinitive lemma) and the past participle of that verb. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:26, 3 March 2014 (UTC)

== Hot words ==

Lately there has been a lot of debate about words such as [[olinguito]] and [[Euromaidan]], which don't pass CFI but likely will in the future. I think that instead of keeping them outside of CFI, we should amend CFI to accommodate such words.

Proposal for special provisions for "hot words":
* If a word that can be considered beneficial to Wiktionary has citations that do not span the required time period, but meet the following criteria, the word may be kept as a "hot word". The citations must be:
** relatively recent.
** reach a wide population.
** from a wide variety of media.
* An entry for a "hot word" will have a highly visible indication of its special status.
* While a "hot word" meets the above criteria, it will have the same rights as any other entry and may even be featured on the main page.
* A "hot word" will be reevaluated every time its lifespan doubles and if it does not still meet the above criteria, it must be deleted.

: Including “hot” words is a good idea, but I think it would be better if we added them to the Appendix namespace and linked to them with a template similar to {{temp|only in}}.

== Plural forms of proper nouns ==

Many proper nouns have well-attested plural forms; for example, ''[[Frances]]'', ''[[Germanies]]'', ''[[Caitlins]]'' and ''[[Jesuses]]''. It seems to me that we could create a couple of templatised usage notes which would explain two major categories of proper noun plurals, namely: 
# The plurals of personal names, which are used to refer to multiple individuals with the same name, and perhaps sometimes in the same way as placename-plurals (q.v.), as in "the two Obamas [the college-age one with X political views and the sitting president with Y political views] might not even recognise each other". And: 
# The plurals of placenames, which are used when comparing or contrasting two historical incarnations, or two current or historical governments or social incarnations, of a place, e.g. "the border between the two Germanies", "unite the two Jerusalems", "John Edwards assailed the divide between the two Americas".
Some plurals would need more explanation than the template alone would provide — there is slightly more to say about the use of ''Germanies'' than about ''Frances''/''Estonias''/''Denmarks'', and more to say about the use of ''Jesuses'' than about ''Caitlins''/''Barbaras''/''Annas''/etc — but additional information could easily be provided along with or even in place of the templatised usage note. </br>What do you think? Would it be a good idea to have such usage notes? Where should they be placed: in ''France''/''Anna'' etc, in ''Frances''/''Annas'' etc, or in both places? What should the titles of the templates that contain the notes be? [[Template:U:Latin stop+liquid poetic stress alteration|Some templatised usage notes]] exist in a "U:" 'subnamespace' like the "R:" one that our reference templates exist in; [[Template:ff-common-note|others are named in other ways]]. (Many languages use the plurals of personal and place names the same way English does, so it would seem inappropriate to use a language prefix.)

Note that some literature takes the opposite stance and considers Luhu to be a dialect of Piru, but the end result for us — that we have a language with <tt>{"Luhu", "Piru"}</tt> as its <tt>names</tt> field — is the same.

== [[Appendix:Orphaned words]] is neglected ==

[[Appendix:Orphaned words]] could use some TLC. Half the information is in hidden comments in the source of the page. The term "Orphaned word" seems not to be used elsewhere, and perhaps it should be called [[w:Unpaired word|unpaired words]] or "[[w:Cranberry morpheme|cranberry morphemes]]" or "[[w:Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized terms]]" as it seems to contain all of the above. If it weren't just seven words long I'd suggest creating an appendix for each of the above. In order to clear up confusion and stop them being added again, false examples should be listed as such, rather than be deleted (e.g. where the apparent etymology is different to the actual, or where compounding happened in another language). The centered table format seems out of place on Wiktionary. And the list seems like it could be much longer.

Anyone want to have a go at adding terms to it, renaming it, reformatting it, splitting it up, turning it into a category (or categories), merging with the list on Wikipedia's [[w:Unpaired word|Unpaired word]] page, or generally just cleaning it up?

== Links to Wikipedia in reference templates ==

Hello all. [[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] and I are currently in disagreement about whether to link to Wikipedia from reference templates (the ones that start with <tt>R:…</tt>). Take {{temp|R:L&S}} as an example: I prefer [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AR%3AL%26S&diff=25801969&oldid=25800450 this version], whereas Dan Polansky prefers [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template:R:L%26S&diff=next&oldid=25801969 this version]. There are other differences between those two diffs, but the salient bone of contention is whether or not to link to [[w:A Latin Dictionary]] in the template code.

I assert that reference templates should link to the relevant cited authority's Wikipedia article; that way, an explanation for ''why'' the source is being cited as an ''authority'' is readily available for the sceptical reader on the other side of the link. Dan Polansky maintains that such links are distracting and inessential; the latter because a reader can copy the name of the reference work and paste it to Wikipedia article box thereby finding the relevant article.

You can see the (short) discussion so far at [[User talk:Dan Polansky#Re linking in reference templates]]. As far as I can tell, [[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] and I support such linking (''i.e.'', single links to the cited authority's Wikipedia article ''only''), whereas Dan Polansky opposes such linking. I come here to try to obtain consensus for such linking. What do others think? — [[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 19:39, 9 March 2014 (UTC)

P.S.: {{ping|Atelaes|Dan Polansky}} I have tried to represent your views faithfully; please post corrections hereto if you feel I have misrepresented either of your positions.

:We have a number of templates that contain two links, one to a webpage that has substantive information relevant to the headword and one to some page that explains the source in some way, either at WP or a source site page such as its home page or "About us". Having two links increases the possibility for confusion. We seem to have all possible kinds of user preferences and behavior with respect to such links in unknown proportions: not being able to find and follow blue links even when they would help, finding them distracting/following them accidentally, hitting the source-site link rather than the content page link, as well as figuring out which link is relevant to one's needs and using it appropriately. 
:This discussion makes me wonder whether we should reduce the size of the source link by not having the entire site title be clickable. That would seem to reduce the likelihood of following the source-explanation link when one wanted the content link.

References on the page should follow the same format as references for quotations, as much as possible.

If we format references consistently, then it is less confusing to link to Wikipedia articles for titles or authors (I’d suggest limiting this to one link, to the author only if there is no article about the work). Why not use the visible shortcut to show the nature of the interwiki link?:

I tend to oppose other linking (e.g. linking of author names and work titles) in reference templates, too, because users may click on the work-title links expecting to get to the cited page in the reference, and then have to backtrack. (On File pages that say "This is a file from the [[:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. Information from its [[:File:Cat03.jpg|description page there]] is shown below.", I have on an embarrassingly large number of occasions been distracted enough to click on the "[[:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]" link and then have to backtrack and click the link to the actual file.) Linking author and/or work names when quoting a book under a sense, the way {{w|Thomas Jefferson}} is linked in [[[[liberticide]]]], is more acceptable, because I think users are less likely to click the links expecting to get to the citation, since they can already see the citation (quoted on the very next line).

I take on board the general opposition to overuse of wikilinking; I apologise, for I hadn't realised how distracting and potentially confusing others find it, because I don't myself find such linking particularly distracting nor at all confusing. ''Re'' the proposed alternatives to [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AR%3AL%26S&diff=25801969&oldid=25800450 this version]:
* {{reply to|DCDuring|p=}} ("reduc[ing] the size of the source link by not having the entire site title be clickable" and the Rhipidistia/Palaeos format proposed above in your post timestamped: 22:38, 13 March 2014): Unfortunately, I think that your format would be ''more'' likely to cause users to follow the incorrect link (or at least, I believe it would if most users are anything like me). I say that because, when I see a blue link with either <font color="blue"><big>□</big><span style="margin-left:-1.2ex;">⇗</span></font> or a padlock (or whatever) beside it, I correctly interpret it to be an external link, whereas when I see a simple blue link, I interpret that as an internal (''i.e.'', intra-Wikimedia) link (with dark blue for Wiktionary links and light blue for links to other MW projects); that, I expect, is what the software's developers intended. Although there are some links to sources that point to Wikisou rce, most source links on the English Wiktionary are external links (usually to Google Books or Usenet). The fact about sourcing here and the software developers' intent interact in the mind to produce in me (and, I assume, in others) the assumption that a link with <font color="blue"><big>□</big><span style="margin-left:-1.2ex;">⇗</span></font> or a padlock (or whatever) beside it is the source of whatever I'm looking at/for. (And it seems as if that assumption is also behind the recommended use of {{temp|usex}}'s <tt>ref=</tt> parameter.) For me, the format you give would temporarily confuse me, until I'd hovered over the links to guess by their URLs the content of what they're pointing to. (''Pace'' {{ping|-sche|p=,}} your confusion-causing example concerns two plain blue, internal links, and not one internal link with one external link; I suspect you would be far less likely to make the same mistake were you to be faced with the latter combination.)

* {{reply to|Dan Polansky|p=}} ("I…oppose the extraneous 'New York: Harper & Brothers' added"): Come to think of it, it seems pretty unnecessary to mention the publisher at all; what do you say we remove the "Oxford: Clarendon Press" bit, too?
* {{reply to|Mzajac|p=}} ("format[ting] references consistently" and "Why not use the visible shortcut to show the nature of the interwiki link?"): I agree with you regarding what I take to be your point about consistent formatting of references: that they should conform, as closely as analogously appropriate, to the standard format(s) laid out in [[WT:"]], yes? If that is indeed what you mean, why did you put the publication date immediately after the authors' names? For consistency with WT:", the date should be included in parentheses immediately after the publisher's name (see the citation from ''{{w|Treasure Island}}'' under [[WT:"#Between the definitions]]). As for including the ISBNs, they automatically create blue links, which many in this discussion have opposed, and they are of very marginal usefulness; I suggest we not include them for those reasons. I confess that I dislike "''[[w: A Latin Dictionary]]''", although largely on aesthetic grounds; would something like "<sup>w:</sup>''{{w|A Latin Dictionary}}''" be acceptable?
In the light of the discussion so far, I suggest one of the two following formats for, ''e.g.'', {{temp|R:L&S|2=via|3=via}}:

== Stop treating Nynorsk and Bokmal as languages separate from Norwegian ==
:''Previous discussions: [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2008/March#Norwegian_language_classification|March 2008]], [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour/2008/July#Norwegian_.E2.80.93_again|July 2008]], [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/2011/February#Norwegian_headings|February 2011]], [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/January#Norwegian_Bokm.C3.A5l.2FNynorsk|January 2012]], [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/August#Problem:_Norwegian_dialectal_entries|August 2012]].''
:''On March 20th, [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-03/Unified Norwegian]] will begin so that we can (hopefully) formalize a policy on this oft-discussed subject.''

At present, we treat all three of "Norwegian" (code ''no''), "Norwegian Bokmål" (''nb'') and "Norwegian Nynorsk" (''nn'') as languages. We have 5800 ==Norwegian== entries, 4800 ==Norwegian Bokmål== entries and 7400 ==Norwegian Nynorsk== entries. I and [[WT:RFM#Category:Translation_requests_.28Norwegian.29|several others]] think we should stop treating Bokmål and Nynorsk as languages separate from Norwegian. <br>As was pointed out in a previous discussion, Nynorsk and Bokmål are two standards of Norwegian, but there are other standards (e.g. Riksmål) and many dialects whose words, because they cannot be labelled Bokmål or Nynorsk, would ironically be the sole users of the plain ==Norwegian== header if we were ever to seriously consider Nynorsk and Bokmål separate languages (but in fact most of the words which currently use the ==Norwegian== header are acceptable in both, or sometimes just one, of the standards). <br>Bokmål and Nynorsk are mutually intelligible <small>(see e.g. Rubén Chacón-Beltrán's ''Introduction to Sociolinguistics'', page 135, and Joshua Fishman and Ofelia Garcia's ''Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity'', page 434)</small>. They are no more different than US English and Indian English or txtspk or any of the other forms of English we handle very well with context tags rather than separate L2 headers. <br>In a previous discussion, someone (I don't recall who) made the point that there also exists a degree of mutual intelligibility between Norwegian and Danish. The person who made this point seemed to think it constituted an argument against merging Nynorsk and Bokmål. I dismiss this slippery slope fallacy. If anyone wants to propose merging Norwegian and Danish, they can start a section about that below this one, and the merits of it can be discussed, but the question I ask in this section is: "should we stop treating ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk== as languages separate from ==Norwegian==?"

I strongly suggest people interested in the topic read some.

: Bokmål and Nynorsk are different enough to be considered separate languages, because they are also different enough from Swedish and Danish. It's true that Nynorsk is skewed more towards the west of Norway while Bokmål is closer to the urban speech of the east, but that's only kind of relevant, because in reality both standards claim to be written representations of the full range of speech in all of Norway. That is, the aim of both is to be a single unified language for all Norwegians, not merely to represent some part of them. So even if they have a different dialectal base, they are not regional dialects of Norwegian; they're both Norwegian, period. That means IMO that they can't be treated as true languages; languages have phonology, and pronunciation, but Bokmål and Nynorsk don't have anything to do with speech. That in itself must mean that they are not languages, because they are ''written standards only''. The situation is really more like that between ekavian and ijekavian Serbo-Croatian, where one is free to choose whichever. And similar also to Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, or between Latin and Cyrillic Serbian, where different speakers within the same region might decide to use different forms depending on their preference.
: Some Norwegians do claim to "speak Bokmål" or "speak Nynorsk", but what really happens there, as far as I know, is that people simply follow the vocabulary and idioms that are part of one standard or the other. The standards are fairly strict in that regard, they also tell you which words to use! But that could be considered a spelling pronunciation, and I doubt that people do this in everyday life; they'll just speak the local dialect without regard to the Bokmål-Nynorsk division. That of course shows the reality of the situation: as far as everyday speech goes, there's really no such thing as Bokmål or Nynorsk, but there's no "Norwegian" either. There's just varieties as spoken in Norway. Plenty of people will use words that are proscribed by (not included/sanctioned in) either standard. When reading Bokmål out loud, their pronunciation might actually be closer to the Nynorsk spelling, or it might match neither one closely.
: So really, when we split these into separate languages, we end up with the confusing situation in which both language forms always have the same range of dialectal pronunciations and must therefore have '''duplicated, identical pronunciation sections'''. The split also leaves out any forms that are part of neither standard, which Wiktionary must include as part of its NPOV policy. We can't simply decide that all Norwegians must speak either Bokmål or Nynorsk, and whatever doesn't fit those can't be included. I think that implies that we ''must'' by necessity have a language header to account for forms found in neither standard. So that really gives us only two possible ways to handle the situation:
:* Three headers: Bokmål, Nynorsk, and a third language header for whatever words are left out of either one. This would create duplication of all pronunciation information.
:* One header: Norwegian, which encompasses both standards, as well as anything that falls outside them.

* Expanding on my earlier comment: Nynorsk and Bokmål are two of the prescriptivist written standards of Norwegian; they include many, but far from all, Norwegian terms and spellings. Some Norwegian words and spellings fell out of use before Nynorsk and Bokmål came into existence, others are not accepted by either standard but are still used (e.g. in dialects), and others are prescribed by other standards, e.g. Riksmål, the standard used by Norway's largest newspaper, {{w|Aftenposten}}. Our descriptivism and NPOV require that we include all these words. <br>If we consider Norwegian to be a language, this is simple to do: we include all the words under a Norwegian header, and use whatever context tags are appropriate: {{temp|cx|dialectal}}, {{temp|cx|Nynorsk}}, {{temp|cx|obsolete}}/{{temp|obsolete spelling of}}, {{temp|cx|Bokmål}}, {{temp|cx|Riksmål}}, etc. <br>If, on the other hand, we consider Nynorsk and Bokmål to be separate languages, things get harder: <br>- Whenever a term or sense is attested, but we cannot determine if it is acceptable in Nynorsk or Bokmål, we must have a ==Norwegian== section. Readers may expect the ==Norwegian== section to document all the uses the term has in Norwegian, but it may document only the term's obsolete or nonstandard uses. <br>- In the many cases that a term/spelling is used in both Nynorsk and Bokmål, we must duplicate content in a ==Norwegian Nynorsk== section and a ==Norwegian Bokmål== section on the same page. If the spelling is also used in Riksmål, we must document this as well... apparently by having a third section on the page, namely a ==Norwegian== section with a {{temp|cx|Riksmål}} tag. <br>- '''If the prescriptivist body which regulates Nynorsk (or Bokmål) deprecates a particular term or spelling, or newly allows a previously unacceptable term or spelling, we must change the language we consider the term to be''' based on the prescriptivist body's decree. We cannot determine the language of a term we encounter in the wild without referring to the prescriptivist body which governs that "language". '''This is fundamentally incompatible with our descriptivism and policy of NPOV.''' We would never strip the ==French== header off an attested French word or spelling just because the French Academy deprecated it. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:15, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
*: PS, in previous threads it was noted that the ISO has granted Nynorsk and Bokmål their own codes: the ISO has also granted codes to [[WT:LANGTREAT|many other lects which are not independent languages, listed here]], and to at least one "language" that doesn't even exist, [[Wiktionary:Language treatment/Discussions#Excluding_vmf|vmf]]/"Mainfränkisch".

::* Is it necessarily true that Nynorsk and Bokmål are, by definition, prescriptive standards? I mean, there exist real works that are written using those standards; is it necessarily true that, no matter how many Nynorsk or Bokmål works a word appears in, it's only actually "Nynorsk" or "Bokmål" if the Norwegian Language Council endorses it as such? (I've heard people make similar claims about other languages — e.g., saying something is "not French" if it's not Academically recognized — and usually we're quite happy to ignore such prescriptivist poppycock. What about Nynorsk and Bokmål will forcibly compel us to heed the Council?) —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:35, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

:::* We agree that we should not not strip the ==French== header off an attested French spelling just because the {{w|Académie française|Académie}} does not accept it. If, however, we decide to have a marker (say, a header or a tag like {{temp|cx|Académician French}}) indicating a spelling's presence in the Académie's standard, we should not apply it to spellings the Académie does not accept. Such spellings should have only the basic header (==French==) and not an {{temp|cx|Académician French}} tag. Right?
:::* In my view, our ==Norwegian== header corresponds to that scenario's ==French==, and we have headers for two specific standards (namely ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk==) that correspond to {{temp|cx|Académician French}}. As with French spellings, I think Norwegian spellings which are not in the Bokmål and Nynorsk standards should have only the basic header (==Norwegian==), not Bokmål or Nynorsk tags or headers.
:::* Just as the appearance of a particular word/spelling (say, *''défoobaristiqué'') in French books which otherwise use Académie-approved spellings does not override the Académie's rejection of ''défoobaristiqué'' and make it Académician French, the appearence of a word/spelling (*''enfoobarig'') in books which otherwise use Nynorsk-approved spellings does not, in my view, make ''enfoobarig'' Nynorsk.
:::* Now, one might take a different view, and think ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk== are more like {{temp|cx|US}} and {{temp|cx|UK}}, i.e. dialects, than written standards. Under such a view, it would be more intelligible to see a word's presence in a "Nynorsk work" as indicating it to be Nynorsk. However, (1) CodeCat does a good job of explaining why Nynorsk and Bokmål "are written standards only", not true languages (or, I would add, true dialects). And (2) one would still have to refer to the prescriptive body's list of which words are Nynorsk—or how else would one determine whether the ''other'' spellings in the work were Nynorsk or Bokmål, in order to infer whether the work, and thus ''enfoobarig'', was in Nynorsk or Bokmål?
:::* (And so, because we're using L2 headers to do what should be done with context tags, [in my view] we reach the unusual position of having to change a term's L2 header based on a prescriptivist body's rulings. Changing a ''context tag'' based on prescriptivists' rulings is, in contrast, fairly common: if, for example, authorities proscribe a term, and we notice, we often add a {{temp|cx|proscribed}} or {{temp|cx|sometimes|proscribed}} tag and (on our best days) explanatory usage notes.)

::::* I guess I'm just missing the step from "this is a written standard" to "this is wholly owned and operated by a standards body". I mean, U.S. English also has a written standard, distinct from any spoken dialect, but no single entity defines that standard, and we don't find ourselves preternaturally incapable of identifying works written in it. (My point being — if you're correct that Bokmål and Nynorsk are really nothing but prescriptivist figments, and not language varieties that people actually write in, then not only should they not be language headers, but they ''probably'' shouldn't even be context tags.) —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:24, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

* '''support'''. I was just notified of this discussion by [[User:-sche|- -sche]]. My native language is Norwegian (Bokmål {{smiley}}) and I speak a few other languages. I must say that my personal view is that these two languages ideally should be treated as one. But that is a practical view on it. As most contributors have pointed out, the differences between the two are small.  I definitely support the use of {{temp|cx|Nynorsk}} and {{temp|cx|Bokmål}} tags. If you drop that altogether, you would definitely make a mess and create a lot of confusion.

: However, this is quite intricate. One would ideally also need a {{temp|cx|Riksmål}} and a {{temp|cx|Nonstandard}} tag. Riksmål is really a subset of Bokmål. And you also need a tag that allows all the permutations of Bokmål, Nynorsk and Riksmål. I.e. (N/B/R), (N/B), (B/R) and theoretically also (N/R). You also need a tag to point out if a word lacks adequate information, In fact, that is how we have decided to do things on the Norwegian project, if not for an altogether different reason. The number of active contributors on either project is small, so instead of duplicating our effort we decided to join forces. 

: The general sense here in Norway, however, is to keep the two languages apart. The topic is politically quite sensitive, and there are plenty of zealots on either side. Had there been more active users on the Norwegian project I am sure we would have kept the two languages as separate projects. The grammar in the two subsets of the same languages vary quite a lot and there are lots and lots of words that are spelled differently. It is a very time consuming effort to create grammar templates that cater for all needs.

: So, to sum it up, I think it is too easy to dismiss the two as one language. However, for practical reasons I think they should be treated as on non-Norwegian projects. I sincerely hope other Norwegian native speakers will also have their say. I don’t want to be the sole voice of the ones who actually speak this language.

:* <i>Might I also take this opportunity to ask for help on the Norwegian project itself? We are simply too few active contributors to progress in a speedy fashion. We need help with some of the features that bigger projects have implemented long ago. E.g. making translation templates that helps a non-proficient user to quickly add a translation and to add that translated word in the Norwegian project itself. And helping out with programming some smart features like words lacking important sections like a grammar section, etc. I love some of the gadgets I have seen elsewhere but lack the skill to implement them. </i> --[[User:Teodor605|Teodor]] ([[User_talk:Teodor605|d]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/Teodor605|c]]) 00:18, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

** I already gave this support. Czech and Slovak represent distinct dialect bases and nobody would claim that either one could cover the whole Czech-Slovak continuum. But with Bokmål and Nynorsk, there is no such geographical "tie": they are both used scattered throughout Norway. It would be as if written Czech and Slovak were both used in both countries, and each person would be free to choose which one, regardless of what dialect they actually spoke, and we'd call them "Knižný Jazyk" and "Nový Československý". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:20, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

Although a lot of words are the same in Bokmål and Nynorsk, as well as Danish and Swedish, there are differences in the inflections between the two languages, especially the plural inflections; only in very few cases are the inflections for nouns completely the same, such as for [[snømann]], or mass nouns. In some cases the noun gender can differ; a feminine noun in Nynorsk is usually both masculine and feminine in Bokmål, probably a compromise between Riksmål, which doesn't have a feminine gender, and Nynorsk.<br>I have gradually been eliminating the Tbot entries, determining whether each one is Bokmål, Nynorsk, or both. Any new entries I make are split between the two languages where appropriate. It should also be pointed out that there are separate Wiktionaries for Bokmål and Nynorsk, so why should the English Wiktionary differ from this? There are also separate Wikipedias for both languages. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 19:50, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
*: There is no problem at all in having separate inflection tables for different standards, nor for having different genders for different standards. This is not an obstacle to merging them. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:57, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
*: [edit conflict] I don't understand why separate inflections is an argument for keeping them separate. Look at the inflection tables for Catalan verbs on the Catalan Wiktionary for example ([[:ca:cantar]]). They contain quite a few different alternative forms, depending on dialect; some are part of a standard (Catalan has multiple standards, like Norwegian), some are not. Our current inflection tables don't cover all of these standards, but they probably should at some point. That is not a reason to separate Catalan into multiple languages of course, so it can't be a reason to do that for Norwegian either. All it means is that we need to include more than one inflection table in some Norwegian entries, but that's hardly a problem. As for gender, I don't see how that's a problem either. Norwegian is not the only language where nouns may have ambiguous gender; Dutch is another example, and there are more. We haven't had any trouble with handling those cases, so again we wouldn't expect trouble in this case. Furthermore, you haven't addressed any of the issues that arise from keeping the languages separate (like the question of nonstandard forms), which are far more disruptive. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:03, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*: Re separate wikis: There are also separate Serbian and Croatian Wiktionaries and Wikipedias, yet en.Wikt found it best to have one Serbo-Croatian language rather than several. Re different inflections: English and German also have words which inflect differently, or (in the case of German) have different gender, in different varieties of the language. ''[[Joghurt#German]]'', with its multiple genders and inflection tables, shows how this can be handled. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:06, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*:: It is both true and false that there is both a Bokmål and a Nynorsk Wiktionary, as [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] claims. The ''nn'' project is dead. Check the number of non-bot contributions over the last three years... There was a vote, in 2008 or 2009 I think, to merge them, and all of the ''nn'' content was merge into the ''no'' project. But that was because there weren't enough active users, especially on the Nynorsk project. I wasn't contributing much at that time so I didn't take part in the discusion. The ''no'' project now uses tags to mark ''nb'', ''nn'', ''Riksmål'', and also ''non-standard''. I agree with [[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] when he says there are no dictionaries that treat Nynorsk and Bokmål as one language. If we have the resources to keep them separated I support his view. However, I fear that will just lead to poorer quality, especially when it comes to Nynorsk. The number of active users of Nynorsk is steadily declining, and even in the Norwegian project itself it is hard to find contributors willing to put in the necessary time to check grammar, make grammar templates accomodate Nynorsk inflections etc. Is it very likely that the English project would fare any better? --[[User:Teodor605|Teodor]] ([[User_talk:Teodor605|d]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/Teodor605|c]]) 20:32, 16 March 2014 (UTC) 
* '''Strong oppose''' It would be hypocritical to merge the two versions of Norwegian while keeping the while keeping Danish, Norwegian (Bokmål + Nynorsk) and Swedish separate (because that merger is not likely to happen in the near future, is it? Being pragmatic here). I have yet to encounter a dictionary that treats Bokmål and Nynorsk as the same language, just as I have yet to encounter a dictionary that treats Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as one language (even though they are; check [[User:Njardarlogar/nn-nb-sv-da-vocab|this list]] to get an idea).
: We don't have separate headers for e.g. British English and American English because they are hardly ever treated as separate languages (there is no good reason for that they should be, either). British and American English have the same origin; they share a common core. Nynorsk and Bokmål do not. Bokmål evolved gradually from Danish, while Nynorsk was created from scratch based on rural Norwegian dialects; so the two standards are not as related as one could initially be led to believe (think of [[w:Convergent evolution|convergent evolution]] in biology). Again, please take a look at the [[User:Njardarlogar/nn-nb-sv-da-vocab|list I just linked to]] to get an idea of what we are dealing with. It is in no way such that Bokmål + Nynorsk = Norwegian while Danish and Swedish are entirely different beasts; and the list will give you a strong indication of this. --[[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 23:28, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
:: That still doesn't change the fact that Bokmål and Nynorsk are both standards intended to be used by speakers of all dialects in Norway. That makes them fundamentally different from Danish vs Swedish vs Norwegian. The Swedish standard language is only intended to be used by self-declared Swedish speakers in Sweden, not by Norwegian speakers in Norway. Thus, even though there are quite some differences between Bokmål and Nynorsk, the basic fact is still that they are ''both used in all of Norway'', and there is therefore no strong correlation between location and the standard used. Two neighbours speaking the same local dialect in Trondheim might write in Bokmål and Nynorsk respectively. That, to me, makes all other arguments about their supposed differences, and comparisons with other Scandinavian dialects, irrelevant. They are two standards for the ''same set of dialects''; i.e. those spoken in Norway. Those dialects should therefore be grouped together as "Norwegian".
:: Aside from that, you have not addressed any of the problems that having three (or more!) headers for each separate standard creates. Just read through this discussion and you'll get an idea. I and others have already argued that having just 2 headers is untenable with respect to NPOV, and 3 or more headers creates far more problems than it solves. No matter how many standards we treat as separate languages, we still eventually end up having to need one extra language name to cover anything that's not part of any standard. The practice of treating language standards as normative for what can or cannot be included in Wiktionary under a particular header also goes completely against all practice in this area so far. The names "Bokmål" and "Nynorsk" are by definition prescriptive. So unless you provide solutions for the problems noted in this discussion, your oppose vote really does not accomplish anything. It basically becomes "yes, we have problems, but what about my principles!". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:47, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

::: I agree that having three headers is a rather horrible solution that could create a bad precedent in terms of headers cluttering up the pages. At the same time, there already are thousands of living languages on this planet, so a header or two extra doesn't move us into a new league when it comes to number of headers.
::: I don't see why we should have more than 3 headers. There are only 3 separate codes for the Norwegian language, and there are only 2 normally recognised standards of Norwegian, namely Bokmål and Nynorsk. There are two more variants of written Norwegian, and those are Riksmål and Høgnorsk. Riksmål is ''technically'' a subset of Bokmål (plus perhaps a few extra words/spelling variants that are hardly ever found in contemporary Norwegian texts. Also, see which [http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=93161&rom=MP language] the Riksmål Dictionary is described as being written in in one of the biggest online Norwegian bookstores..). Høgnorsk is very uncommon, and is not a standard. Riksmål can be treated under the Bokmål header while Høgnorsk can be treated under the Nynorsk header.
::: Yes, we'd solve a problem with two headers. But we'd create new problems with the tags. How exactly would that work? Should every Norwegian meaning be tagged so that the reader is never in doubt whether the editor simply forgot to add the tag or is not familiar enough with Bokmål and Nynorsk to know that this meaning or word is only found in one of the two standards? And what about words that are considered [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=nos&begge=+&ordbok=nynorsk dialectal in one standard and ordinary in another?] (Bokmål 2 vs Nynorsk 1; [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=hin&begge=+&ordbok=begge hin is another example, 2 vs 1]). Then there's Riksmål and Høgnorsk again. Should one expect an editor to be sufficiently familiar with these two minority variants in order to tag all entries correctly? Should only Riksmål and Høgnorsk words/spellings that are different from Nynorsk and Bokmål be tagged; or would we have to tag all words that can be said to be Riksmål and Høgnorsk?
::: How relevant is it ''really'' that Nynorsk and Bokmål are aimed at Norwegians and not Danes and Swedes? It doesn't sound very descriptive to mention this as an argument. I could write in Swedish and my fellow Norwegians wouldn't have any major issues with understanding what I wrote. Likewise with Danish. Danish used to be the official (de facto or otherwise) language in Norway for centuries, anyway, so it's not a completely theoretical objection. On board Norwegian airliners, if the captain is Danish or Swedish, the captain will give information first in his native Scandinavian variant, then in English. Just like Norwegian pilots give information first in Norwegian, then in English.
::: Then there's also the important fact that despite that both Bokmål and Nynorsk are supposed to be used by all speakers of all Norwegian dialects, they still have very different origins. Bokmål stems from Danish, while Nynorsk stems from rural Norwegian dialects. So by the argument you are providing, if suddenly one day Swedish started to be popular as a written language in Norway, and some proponents of it meant that all Norwegians should write it, then suddenly Swedish is Norwegian; which ''linguistically'' is nonsense.
::: As for being prescriptive; you have to realise that there is no Norwegian language. There is a Mainland Scandinavian language with 4 official written standards: Bokmål, Danish, Nynorsk and Swedish. It's no more prescriptive to label a word as either Bokmål or Nynorsk than it is to label it as Swedish or Danish. 
::: '''-sche''' writes ''We cannot determine the language of a term we encounter in the wild without referring to the prescriptivist body which governs that "language". This is fundamentally incompatible with our descriptivism and policy of NPOV.'' And indeed, this goes for all of Scandinavian, not just Bokmål vs Nynorsk. --[[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 09:51, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
* At least Njardarlogar knows what he is talking about, being a native Norwegian. There are two ''officially'' recognised languages - Bokmål and Nynorsk; Riksmål isn't, and I don't know anything about Høgnorsk. Although a lot of words are similar, and believe it or not an egg is et egg (Bokmål) or eit egg (Nynorsk), there are also many words which differ fundamentally; compare '''[[ukrainer]]''' with '''[[ukrainar]]''', '''[[eier]]''' with '''[[eigar]]''', and '''[[kirke]]''' with '''[[kyrkje]]''', to quote just a few. I suggest comparing a Nynorsk text with one in Bokmål (Wikipedia is a good source), it is quite obvious that the two languages are sufficiently different to be classed as languages in their own right.
I have been slowly sorting out the mess that exists at present, splitting between Bokmål and Nynorsk where possible, entering missing inflections, replacing inflection tables where they are incomplete or erroneous - I am less than enamoured with inflection tables anyway and prefer a more "in your face" presentation of inflections. But it's a slow job, and I have only tackled nouns so far. But my ideal would be to scrap the "Norwegian" (no) heading entirely, leaving us with just Bokmål and Nynorsk. I would hate to see the work I have done so far undone by a whim. It would be very disheartening, and could lead to my ceasing to contribute.

English spellings like ''[[grey]]'' have quotations and usexes that use ''grey'', while spellings like ''gray'' have quotations and usexes that usex ''gray''. Sometimes ''lemma'' entries have quotations from ''all'' forms of a word, e.g. ''[[wight]]'' includes a quotation that actually uses the obsolete spelling ''wyght'', but users have said in past discussions that they felt that was good because the lemma should represent all the forms.

Because Nynorsk and Bokmål are separate standards with different grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure etc. It's not adequate to give an example in only one of the two standards. And examples need to be attached to meanings. Your example at [[grey]] is not (even if it can be deduced which meaning is meant).

== A new format for Chinese entries (multisyllables) ==
{{temp|look}}
At present, our Chinese (Mandarin mostly) entries are structured like [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2&oldid=25816297#Mandarin this]. This format has a number of drawbacks:
# It splits the Chinese heading into multiple headings, resulting in duplication of information, since the written form of Chinese is shared across Chinese varieties. It does not take into account the fact that simp-trad correspondences are shared by all Chinese varieties (hence hanzi-box is duplicated for every variety), the semantics is more than 99% of the time the same across dialects, and the etymology is essentially shared across dialects as well.
# It duplicates simp-trad conversions in hanzi-box and every headword template.
# It duplicates pronunciation in every headword template and in the Pronunciation section.
# It duplicates etymology in the hanzi-box and in the Etymology section.

As a consequence, the Chinese-language presence here has been overwhelmingly "Mandarin", which is the basis of {{w|Written Chinese}}, and limiting the growth of other varieties (cf. nouns - [[:Category:Mandarin nouns|Mandarin 20467]], [[:Category:Cantonese nouns|Cantonese 317]], [[:Category:Wu nouns|Wu 10]]). Hence a change in the format is much needed. I have created [[User:Wyang/歷史]] and some new templates (see below). What do people think of this format? The code for an entry in such format would be (excluding the temporary userspace markers since the templates do not exist yet):

<pre>
==Chinese==
{{wikipedia|lang=zh}}
===Etymology===
{{zh-forms|s=历史|to go through,<br>to experience|history,<br>records}}

:::Re: your example entry: [[User:Wyang/歷史]]:
:::Every foreign script entry has transliteration in the header, apart from Lao and Burmese, which have separate transliteration tables. Since Hanyu pinyin is the standard transliteration system for Mandarin, in my opinion, each PoS header should also repeat pinyin, like this: '''{{lang|cmn|歷史}}''' (lìshǐ) (even if they are multiple).

:::Entries should be sorted by numbered pinyin (as agreed previously), so 歷史 should be sorted by li4shi3 and appear under letter "L", not under character 歷 or radical 止.

<pre>
{{zh-pron
|m=lìshǐ
|c=lik6 si2

|w=5liq sr
|ma=y|ca=y|wa=y

:::::, which would add the page to the following categories: 1) "Chinese nouns", "Chinese verbs", "Chinese adjectives", "zh:History|*", "zh:Insects"; or 2) "Mandarin nouns", "Cantonese nouns", ... depending on what everyone prefers. Each of these categories would be sorted by the respective sort key, eg. Pinyin for "Category:Mandarin nouns". Regardless, one can always call variety-specific categories, using codes like <pre>{{cx|Cantonese|Wu|lang=zh}}</pre> in the definition.
::::2. Regarding headword templates - I think we can generalise it to something like [[Template:zh-pos]], since Chinese is uninflecting and there is no point in using a different base template for each PoS. I don't think the absence of a transliteration in the template is a problem. The requirement of transliterations is to guide pronunciation. Here the Pronunciation section has made romanisations and IPA pronunciations in various varieties sufficiently clear to readers, and I think we can use the precedent of Burmese entries (which also involves multiple transliterations) in this case.
::::3. Regarding Pinyin: Pinyin in the pronunciation template can be made clickable. And when acceleration creation is enabled in the preferences, one can click on the uncreated Pinyin in trad-form entries to create it. Trad-to-simp conversion can be performed hardly with any errors.

:::::Re: ''There is no point in using a different base template for each PoS.'' But that's how all all languages are structured here, including non-inflected ones. It allows categorisation and other things, e.g. for nouns, you can add optional measure words (classifiers). If they are simple, it just makes it easy when recreating each headword for each SoP.
::::: The suggested pronunciation section is quite big and may be even overwhelming to some users (I don't mean it's bad). What if more dialects are added? Having a simple pinyin looks much neater and that's what users see in published dictionary. Just standard pinyin in brackets, next to Hanzi, no other schema. Please consider. Burmese has various standards but I'd prefer that they've selected at least one to use in the headword, same with Lao. Just my opinion but that's also the established practice with current Mandarin entries. (Note that Burmese and Lao, currently a bit neglected have been maintained by one user each - Angr and Widsith but we have a bunch of editors with Chinese now). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 11:51, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::::::Sure, I still mean using <pre>{{zh-noun|mw=根|hsk=b}}</pre> in the headword, but make templates like [[Template:zh-noun]] call [[Template:zh-pos]] or some module, instead of making them call [[Template:head]] separately like [[Template:cmn-noun]] etc. currently do. -pos templates also exist for some other languages, and in fact I got this idea from [[Template:ja-pos]].

:::::::If we convert existing entries to this format, the vast majority will just have one variety in the Pronunciation section, i.e. Pinyin. The example I created was more of an extreme case - I doubt that section will be heavily populated by readings. Four (Mandarin, Cantonese, Min Nan, Wu) probably represents the limit. For other varieties, there is simply a lack of comprehensive dictionaries (not dialectal word dictionaries) like those dedicated to these four.
:::::::Regarding "see also" content - Those are not part of the change. The preference for clustered "see also" terms is more of a personal habit - I find it a little easier to locate content when various things are grouped by relatedness.
:::::::Burmese headword templates don't have transliterations ([[လောက]]). The transliterations are handled by [[Template:my-roman]], which is kind of similar to what the proposed template "Template:zh-pron" would do. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 12:17, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

::::::::::I think the pronunciation section could and should look simpler (and smaller) and topolects should be added vertically, not horizontally, similar to how US/UK English sections are organised, e.g. [[man]].

:I see three differences between the proposed format and our current format.
:# Some templates are changed. For the most part, the changes look like improvements, but proposed/new ''zh-pron'' needs more work: the proposed horizontal arrangement is so wide that smartphones and computers with small screens will have trouble with it, but the proposed vertical arrangement pushes the actual content (definitions) several screens down. (And if additional dialects are added, it will become even more unwieldy.) A large part of its bulk comes from its tabular format. Reworking it to use [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User:-sche/%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2&oldid=25821981 our usual bulleted-list format] would seem to solve these problems.
:# The proposal lumps Synonyms, Antonyms, Derived terms, Descendants etc into the ===See also=== section. I agree with Anatoli that we should not do this. There is no reason for our treatment of Chinese antonyms to differ from our treatment of Latin ones. The proposed format would become particularly untenable whenever a word had a large number of synonyms, antonyms, and/or derived terms, like some of the words for tea probably do.
:# The proposal groups the various Chinese languages under one header. This is the bit that may be most controversial. As spoken, the varieties are often not mutually intelligible... yet (as has been noted) they are written the same way, and Wiktionary is a written dictionary.
:[[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 00:51, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks. Wyang has responded to your second point, it's not part of a change, so, it should probably be removed from the example page to avoid confusion. I like your bulleted example. Most entries won't have such a big variety, since we don't have editors and knowledge of dialects. The existing ones should be imported.
::On the main issue of merging all topolects into one L2 "Chinese" there has been surprisingly few comments. I'm sure there will be resistance, if there is a vote. Yes, all written forms can be accommodated into one Chinese section, despite them being not mutually intelligible (when spoken out loud!). Perhaps THIS problem should be solved first. There are other important improvements. If we ignore the pronunciation section (partially automated), entries will become easier to create. The main difficulty and source of errors for beginners was "rs" (radical sort) value, which stopped even native speakers from adding contents. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 01:25, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

:::Thanks. Format of the pronunciation template isn't an issue; it can be easily changed when all pages link to it, whether it be a table or a list. To me the list form is not as good-looking, but it is much easier to change to. I am not sure what was meant by the unresolved problem with the merger - like said above, variety-specific labels can be applied when necessary. Looking at [[:Category:Cantonese nouns]] and [[:Category:Min Nan nouns in traditional script]], most currently-existing entries in these varieties are not dialectal words. There isn't a huge number of currently-existing entries for other varieties (something less than 2000) compared with Mandarin (around 35000), and these can be manually examined one-by-one. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 04:17, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
::::The issue is not only technical but political. I know that most existing non-Mandarin entries only differ in pronunciation. The existing written dialectal forms not included here are small in number, even if they may be frequently used. I meant that in the past, after a seeming agreement in the BP, there was a vehement opposition to certain changes. Some editors are currently away or ignoring this page or, this change may create other issues later. If we have a successful vote, then there's no worry. Apart from Pinyin/Zhuiyn missing in the header (which I consider important and it matches the majority of our entries in non-Roman script) and minor formatting (please consider -sche's suggested format or similar) I personally have no issue with your proposal.

:::::(Cantonese native here) {{ping|Atitarev}} Thanks for notifying me. I '''support''' this proposal. By the way, this is a matter of merging different dialects of Chinese, so I think that [[WT:RFM]] should be notified for this matter. {{temp|context}} should also be modified so that it can show dialects, as I am aware that [[告白]] means a declaration of love in other dialects but advertisement (especially on television) in Cantonese. I support this proposal because I often see lack of definition in Cantonese entries while the definition is complete, precise and concise in their Mandarin section, and the definition in Cantonese is often the same as the definition in Mandarin. Still have to look out for dialectal differences, though. As a non-native speaker of English, I apologize for any misunderstanding that I have made. Here is what I mean for dialectal difference:
<pre>
==Chinese==
[pronunciation, etymology and rest of the stuff here]

===Noun===
{{zh-noun|[stuff goes here]}}

# {{context|Mandarin|Min Nan|[other dialects]|lang=zh}} a [[declaration]] of love, a [[confession]] of one's feelings towards someone
# {{context|Cantonese|lang=zh}} an advertisement broadcast on television

{{zh-verb|[stuff goes here]}}

# {{context|Mandarin|Min Nan|[other dialects]|lang=zh}} to [[declare]] love, to [[confess]] one's feelings towards someone

::::::Thanks. I agree with you. BTW, apart from Cantonese, 告白 also means "advertisement" in some Mandarin dialects: eg. {{w|Changli}}, {{w|Hebei}} ({{w|Jilu Mandarin}}) - /kau55-43 pai13/; {{w|Ganyu}}, {{w|Jiangsu}} ({{w|Zhongyuan Mandarin}}) - /kau51-31 pei55/, and possibly in Taiwanese: [https://www.moedict.tw/'%E5%91%8A%E7%99%BD]. Also I think the sense of "declaration of love" is used in Cantonese too ([[google:告白嘅]]). So the page can go something like
<pre>
===Noun===
{{zh-noun|xxx}}

# [[announcement]], [[public]] [[announcement]]
# [[expression]] of one's thoughts; especially, [[declaration]] of love, [[confession]] of one's feelings towards someone
# {{cx|Cantonese|dialectal Mandarin|Min Nan|lang=zh}} [[advertisement]], [[ad]]

===Verb===
{{zh-verb|xxx}}

# to [[pronounce]]; to [[express]] oneself; especially, to [[declare]] love, to [[confess]] one's feelings towards someone

Don't get me wrong. I like where this is going. I am fully capable of creating entries in Wu, which is my native dialect, but it has been the amount of duplication that I have to deal with that puts me off creating any entries for it, so this change would be a big step forward.

* I'm going to sit out of this one. Although I'm one of the regular Mandarin editors here, my technical knowledge is close to zero, so I wouldn't be able to contribute much. However I do support the lumping of all Chinese languages under Chinese in theory. As the sandbox page currently stands, I don't like how the pronunciation boxes are so massive and keep pushing out to the right, it causes the whole page of my browser to elongate. There must be some way to condense this. I agree also that there should be separate headers for See also, Synonyms, etc. just like all the other languages' entries. Anyway, you guys are right - this is a huge proposal for change.

::As I'm not a native speaker of any Chinese variety, it's not a big deal to me if the varieties (technically they're not dialects as the varieties such as Cantonese, Min Nan, etc. have their own local dialects) get merged under a "Chinese" heading.

::One thing I think is important is that we preserve parameters for specific romanization methods (Pinyin and Wade-Giles for Mandarin, Jyutping and Yale for Cantonese, etc.) used in the <nowiki>{{t+|abc}}</nowiki> templates or whatever we would end up using as that helps provide clear information about the readings used for our CJKV word entries.

:::Thanks Anatoli. With translation tables, the only change would be: one can add a translation directly after the * Chinese field after the change, without having to specify a variety. The varieties nested underneath still exist, with appropriate romanisations, even though the characters might be identical. For character entries, the romanisations for varieties will be put into one template in the pronunciation section (the same as the one in [[User:Wyang/歷史]]), with different readings separated by commas. Automatic conversion should be utilised to maximum extent. There are now a number of scripts available for various transliteration or pronunciation conversions, including [[Template:Pinyin-IPA|Pinyin-IPA]] (and other Pinyin analyses, eg. tone markers to tone numbers, adding syllable spacings), [[Module:PinyinBopo-convert|Pinyin-Zhuyin]], [[Module:Bopo-convert|Zhuyin-Pinyin]], [[Module:yue-pron|Jyutping-IPA]], [[Module:wu-pron|wuu-IPA]] and a fairly crude Min Nan pronunciation template ([[Module:nan-pron]]).

== {{template|audio}} to categorize entries? ==

According to this [[Template_talk:audio#Categorisation]] this has been brought up (or at least was meant to?). I think [[:Category:Terms with audio links by language|terms with audio links by language]] categories are very important. Right now all of the members in them are by "hard coding" (actually typing out the category in the entry's body) which I think is very unwieldy.

Lua (among other things) provides the functionality to compare the first x chars of a string to a set of values (correct me if I'm wrong). what could be the chances of using the language codes used in the names of all of pronunciation files to define a category "X terms with audio links" for that entry? E.g., de-[[Amerika]].ogg --> de --> [[:Category:German terms with audio links]].  [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 05:11, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

: I've added some code to add entries to [[:Category:Language code missing/audio]] if the <code>lang=</code> parameter is not present. That would currently include all entries that use {{temp|audio}}. The parameter itself doesn't do anything yet, I only made the change to give the category some time to fill up.
: I did notice something else about the template though. It checks for the presence of the first parameter (the sound file name), and only actually displays anything if that is present. But the first parameter doesn't default to it being empty, so {{temp|audio}} would display something, while {{temp|audio|}} would display nothing. This seems rather strange, so I wonder if that could be removed? Really, the first parameter should always be required, so leaving it empty should be an error; it shouldn't just cause the template to show nothing silently. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:09, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
:: The {{temp|audio-IPA}} template already has the lang= parameter and it's functional. I checked a few entries in [[:Category:Terms with audio links by language]] and they all used the {audio-IPA} instead of {audio}. So adding lang= to {audio} makes sense. While the 'terms with audio' category appears useful, my preference really is the index with immediate audio links, so users do not have to go to each entry to listen to the audio. As an example, see [[Index:Hungarian/d]]. Click the blue arrows and it will play the sound file. Unfortunately, the index is no longer refreshed. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 13:06, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
: I'm OK with the idea of adding lang= to audio and making it obligatory. But what about all the articles with audio files without the lang= parameter? Is someone going to run a bot on these to add it?

So, could we add the param itself to the template? My take on it would be something like this (not sure about the invoke part though):
<code><nowiki>{{#if: {{{lang}}} | [[Category:{{#invoke:languages/templates|lookup|{{{lang}}}|names}} terms with audio links]] | [[Category:Language code missing/audio]] }}</nowiki></code>

And then one could start making any red categories there are (which would probably pop up right to the top of [[Special:WantedCategories]]) as that would be done manually either way, I think. [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 17:36, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

: Thats an invalid comparison. I myself was unaware about the existence of some of these holonyms until a few years ago. Therefore I consider it to be educational since it offers one a varied vocabulary not only for others but myself too - hence i'm dissapointed with the reverts. Plus they deal with the ambiguity that is inherent in the language of some place names. You will notice that i usually ignore holonyms in matters unrelated to geography. This is because only in geography have such holonyms become of critical contemporary importance with intergovernmental organizations, multiregional international organizations, and supraorganizations being organized on the basis "detailed geographical information". I consider my addition to be akin to adding "Balkans" to the Bulgaria page. Nonetheless, i am willing to compromise and be less broad with a sense of proportion next time since that seems to be the main objection.

:::: You may think everyone should know terms like [[Usonia]]- and they should.

:::: There are far too many -nyms applicable to most entries for us to include all of them, so there's some level of selection involved.

Allowing one person's personal taste to prevail over the whole of Wiktionary is a recipe for divisiveness, partisan ugliness and edit-warring when the inevitable backlash sets in. Neutral point of view is one of our fundamental principles for this very reason.
:::: Before you start to claim that what you're trying to push ''is'' neutral, you should consider the difference between ''not taking'' sides and trying to ''equalize'' sides.

See, this is why I generally do not go on edit‐sprees unless somebody preapproves it.

:@Pass a Method — Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's not our place to try to function as a sort of text-based atlas. There's an argument for listing "United States" as a hypernym of each of the U. S. states. But listing "Western Hemisphere" and "North America" is excessive, and opens the door to the listing of even larger, farther-removed regions to which, say, Vermont belongs (e.g. Orion Arm). It's also redundant, because the definition of, say, Vermont should be written in such a way as to communicate the fact that it's located in the United States, and the entry of the United States to communicate that it's in North America, and so forth. -[[User:Cloudcuckoolander|Cloudcuckoolander]] ([[User talk:Cloudcuckoolander|talk]]) 01:56, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

::: French liaisons follow rules: all words beginning with a vowel sound can make a liaison with the previous word if it ends with a consonant. It is something that should be learned in general, not detailed in every word, except for the words that begin with a h which may be either (des [[héros]] = /de e.ʁo/, not /de.z‿e.ʁo/ ; but des [[habitude]]s /de.z‿a.bi.tyd/ not /de a.bi.tyd/) and other exceptions. [[User:Darkdadaah|Dakdada]] ([[User talk:Darkdadaah|talk]]) 14:59, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
:::: But ''vous'' does not end with a consonant, it's {{IPAchar|/vu/}} as shown above. From a phonological point of view, the {{IPAchar|/z/}} is unpredictable and just needs to be memorised.

(Most nouns turn out to have no plural inflection anymore, for example; and for adjectives the feminine is actually the base form.) {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 15:17, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::::: I have always wondered if liaison in French would exist to the same extent if it weren't for the written language (i.e. spelling pronunciations).

:: The change that you mention is predictable. If you know the pronunciation of the word in isolation, then you can predict the lenition of the final consonant depending on the next word. But for French that doesn't work; you have to learn the liaison consonant separately for every word. You can't predict {{IPAchar|/vu.z/}} from {{IPAchar|/vu/}}. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:16, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::: A better comparison would be a language with final devoicing, for which we indicate the devoicing in our transcriptions, but devoicing does not happen when followed by a word that starts with a vowel (let's ignore the case that the following word starts with a voiced consonant, because that could potentially voice previously unvoiced consonants). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:21, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
:::: That too, but I should note that not all languages with devoicing work that way. In Dutch for example it's actually ''morpheme-final'' devoicing, and it happens even to the first part of a compound. {{m|nl|badwater||bath water}} is {{IPAchar|[ˈbɑtˌʋaːtər]}} in normal speech. You rarely hear it pronounced with {{IPAchar|[d]}}, but that depends on dialect and also implicitly reflects a kind of "blurring" of the morpheme boundary, and therefore of the syllable boundary. It's also relatively uncommon with stops, a bit more common with fricatives. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:34, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::::: You can also consider the inflected forms. I'm sure {{m|nl|bad|baden}} is pronounced with a /d/, right? But that is also easy to account for as a voiced inflection paradigm and an unvoiced inflection paradigm. In standard Russian, prepositions and some particles are the only words that regularly retain their voicing before words that start with a vowel; for example {{m|ru|над}}, even though we transcribe it as /nat/ is often actually pronounced /nad/ even in isolation, as attested in the audio sample in our entry. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:46, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

:: {{qualifier|in reply to [[User:Msh210|msh210]] 17:12, 16 March 2014 (UTC)}} This is a feature exhibited by some accents, in a given context /t/ would be realised as [t], [ɾ] or [ʔ] depending on the accent. But this is not phonetically relevant, as well as predictable. Besides, the liaison may be mandatory, forbidden or optional in a given context. Whether an optional liaison is made depends on the speaker, the level of speech –the more formal, the more liaisons are likely to be made–, and the speaker’s mood; it can even, along with elision and prosody, change the meaning, making the statement solemn rather than anodyne. So it’s way more complex than having allophones. – [[User:Pylade|Pylade]] ([[User talk:Pylade|talk]]) 11:28, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

== Request for Comments: c: link prefix for Wikimedia Commons ==

There is a cross-wiki discussion in progress as to whether <code>c:</code> should be enabled globally as an [[:m:Help:Interwiki linking|interwiki]] prefix for links to the [[:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. As your wiki has [[Special:PrefixIndex/c:|several pages or redirects]] whose titles begin with "C:", they will need to be renamed if this proposal gains consensus. Please take a moment to participate in [[:m:Requests for comment/Wikimedia Commons interwiki prefix#2014 RfC|the discussion]]. Thank you.
:What this means: Our entry at [[c:a]] will instead automatically take people to [[commons:a]] once software support for the prefix is implemented. We have a couple of suggested options, like moving to a fullwidth rather than a halfwidth colon, or moving to [[Appendix:Unsupported titles]].

:::On further thought maybe this should have been posted to [[Wiktionary:Requests for moves, mergers and splits]] instead. [[User:TeleComNasSprVen|TeleComNasSprVen]] ([[User talk:TeleComNasSprVen|talk]]) 16:40, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== Redirects in [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|Wikisaurus]] ==

I would like to start using redirects in Wikisaurus because, the way that it is now, I have to search through synonyms of the word I'm looking for to find the page with synonyms of the word I'm looking for. For example, if I want synonyms for ''ceiling'', it is quite possible that a page for ceiling does not exist, and the synonyms that I'm looking for are on the ''roof'' page. However, I cannot do this at present (without messing up the system) because if (using the previous example) I make ''ceiling'' a redirect that sends people to ''roof'', then on the ''roof'' page the word ''ceiling'' has "[WS]" next to it, which links to the Wikisaurus page for ''ceiling''. (Wikisaurus does this automatically.) But then the link to the ''ceiling'' page is completely useless and misleading because it redirects to ''roof'', which is the page that the link is on.

I don't know what would be the best course of action here, but I think something should be done about this if possible. Any ideas? Thanks. —<span style="font-family: Courier; font-size:12px;">[[User:TeragR|TeragR]] <sup>[[User_talk:TeragR|disc.]]/[[Special:Contributions/TeragR|con.]]</sup></span> 03:15, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== Suffix category name conflict ==

== [[Template:only in]] with links to deleted ISO-639 appendices ==

Some ISO-639 language codes were listed first at rfv, then rfd (see [[talk:jv]]). It was finally decided to convert them to "only in" links to the appendices for ISO-639 codes. Now that the appendices have been deleted, we have a bunch of entries with basically nothing but explanations of why there's no entry and a referral to a non-existent appendix (see [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Appendix:ISO_639-1 language codes]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Appendix:ISO_639-3 language codes]]).

Should we:
# delete the entries?
# change them to link to the WP disambiguation page for the entry name?
# change them to link to the appropriate WP list of ISO 639 codes?
# change them to link to [[WT:LL]]?
# do something else?

== [[User:Pass a Method]] ==

Throughout their entire history of editing, this editor has demonstrated what can be described as either notoriously bad judgement or POV pushing. Highlights:

* A lack of understanding of metonymy ([[User talk:Pass a Method#person, penis]])
* Adding gratuitous references to, putting it broadly, contentious cultural and political issues, where they could have been easily avoided ({{diff|21387210|21235995}}, {{diff|22112919|21911422}}); blocked once before for it
* Not paying attention to spelling ([[Talk:antiSunni]]), parts of speech ([[User talk:Pass a Method#rolling the pill]]), headwords ([[User talk:Pass a Method#Synonyms for masturbation: beat the bishop, burp the worm, rolling the pill]]), or idiomaticity (created [[foot fetish]], [[Palestinian spelling]] and twice [[sexually suggestive]]; administrators can verify)
* Promoting obscure terms over popular ones ([[#Recent edits to US location entries]] above, {{diff|25633853|25815369|"ethnicist" or "religionist" over "ethnic" and "religious"}})
* Plain making up terms without verifying they are in use ([[WT:RFV#of Koranic proportions]], [[WT:RFD#traditional African religionist]])

The "good" edits are negligible, and almost always intertwined with some form of the above. Interacting with the user seems to be a waste of time: they are neither improving nor taking hints to leave. I propose an indefinite block. [[User:Kephir|Keφr]] 08:52, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

: This reminds me a lot of Gtroy/Acdcrocks/Luciferwildcat. In both cases they identified real problems in lack of coverage for controversial and/or unpopular subjects, but both exercised poor lexicographic judgment and a sort of counter-prescriptive wishful thinking: terms should exist or have the meanings they thought they should because it made sense in their way of thinking, and the only reason they weren't attested was censorship or bias in the coverage of available sources.
: The sad part is that a clear-headed search for religious and political biases in our entries was and is a good idea, and we needed and still need better coverage of terms that go against the biases of our contributor base. I just wish they had approached it with more common sense so that they wouldn't have wasted so much of their truly prodigious effort on bad edits.
:For all the time wasted in rfv and rfd of stuff that should never have been added, and all the checking needed to weed out the pov and the phoniness they've added to so many entries, they ''have'' made some real contributions in increasing our coverage of religious terms outside of mainstream Judaism and Christianity.

=== Anusvara ===
It would be great if someone helped with the [[anusvara]] (nasalisation symbol) problem in all Indic languages. It affects the pronunciation/transliteration of the vowel and m/n consonants, depending on what follows, for the lack of a better way, it's always "ṁ" but should ã (or other vowel with nasalisation), vowel + "ṅ", vowel + "m" or vowel + "n". Such modules are [[Module:te-translit]], [[Module:si-translit]], [[Module:hi-translit]], etc. The native symbols in any of these modules don't matter, it's the quality of the consonant or lack of it that matters. {{ping|CodeCat}}, could you help? The nasalisation and its transliteration is described here - [[Wiktionary:Hindi_transliteration#Nasalisation]] but I can describe more and make test cases if you agree.

== [[:Category:Gerunds by language]] ==

As [[w:Gerund]] indicates, the term is applied to a wide variety of verb-like words that don't necessarily have much in common otherwise. In English, Dutch and German, it's synonymous with "verbal noun", while in certain Romance languages it indicates an adverb. Because the term "gerund" is so ambiguous, I don't know if it's a good idea to have this category. It would be better to put the entries into other categories, with a name that is more descriptive for the words in question. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:10, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

:You might be right. I was excited to add the boiler (that I didn't know existed) to [[:Category:Livonian gerunds]] but now I have noun category at the bottom. Livonian gerunds are inessives of infinitive and don't decline for anything else (being able to take the inessive is nominal-like behavior but they should be able to take on other cases too if they were nominals but if they would they wouldn't be gerunds anymore.) Tangentially Latvian {{m|lv|-ot}} are also strictly verbal/adverbial (as in ''not nominal''). [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 14:02, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

== Finnish accusative ==

There has been some disagreement between me and [[User:Hekaheka]] over the Finnish accusative case. In the past, our templates always showed at least two forms in the accusative singular box. One that had a form identical to the genitive singular, and one that had a form identical to the nominative singular. When I converted the templates to Lua, I removed the second one, because in my view this isn't an accusative case form at all, and the two aren't just interchangeable, they have separate uses. I wonder why the form that looks like the nominative is called an accusative at all. It's used primarily with imperatives, which have no explicit subject. So it's not a real accusative form in my opinion; it's just the nominative used in the role of imperative direct object. It's not uncommon for languages to use different cases in limited syntactic roles, than they would otherwise. In Slavic languages for example, negative verbs take an object in the genitive, but that doesn't mean that the genitive form should be included under "accusative". Likewise, languages like Icelandic or Latin may have a dative object, but that doesn't make the dative form accusative.

Hekaheka has argued that grammars and standard bodies have stated that there is no accusative case at all, and only a genitive. To me, this position is completely untenable, and this becomes clear when you look at the plural forms of nominative, accusative and genitive together:
* nominative: talo, talo'''t'''
* accusative: talo'''n''', talo'''t'''
* genitive: talo'''n''', talo'''jen'''
This clearly shows that there is no single case that aligns perfectly with accusative function, other than the accusative itself. If you eliminate the accusative as a case, then you end up with convoluted rules like "objects use the genitive in singular but nominative in plural", which doesn't help anyone.

It should also be noted that the identity between accusative and genitive forms is a historical accident, and is a result of sound change rather than a real functional identity between the two cases. In Proto-Uralic, the accusative had the ending -m, while for the genitive it was -n. In the prehistory of Proto-Finnic, final -m became -n, causing the two cases to become identical in form. So historically, there definitely was an accusative case, and the modern Finnish accusative singular -n is a direct descendant of that; it has nothing to do with the genitive. (The accusative plural is identical to the nominative; I don't know whether that's also a historical accident, or something else, but that's not relevant here.)

Since Hekaheka and I just keep arguing on this, I'm asking for wider feedback. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:09, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

:Hekaheka has said that there are two mainstream theories: one, which you summarize and criticize above, is that there is no accusative in modern Finnish, except perhaps in certain pronouns. The other is that there are two accusative forms in modern Finnish. Historically, Wiktionary accepted the latter view. ''If'' Hekaheka is right that these are the only two mainstream theories, I think we should continue to follow one of them — presumably the one we've been following — because I don't think the arguments of one person who doesn't speak Finnish are more convincing than the views of Finnish linguists. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:43, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

* Another 2p from someone who doesn't know squat about Finnish, so take this for what you will.
: I've been taught that, if a language has grammatical cases, and a certain set of case endings is used for a distinct grammatical role, then the grammatical case for that grammatical role exists, even if the case endings it uses are shared with other case endings.
: Case in point (pun intended): German.  Broadly speaking, the feminine singular nominative matches the feminine singular accusative matches the plural nominative matches the plural accusative.  But we don't say that the plural nominative or accusative cases don't exist.  Similarly, the feminine singular dative matches the masculine singular nominative.  But we don't say that the masculine singular nominative doesn't exist.  Etc., etc.
: If the Finnish language has endings that function as a grammatical accusative case, i.e. a set of endings that are consistently applied when a noun is used as the grammatical object, then it follows that Finnish has a grammatical accusative case, even if those endings happen to be shared with other grammatical cases.
: [[Image:Blue Glass Arrow.svg|15px]] I think part of the confusion might stem from how the Finnish authors define “case”.  I don't read Finnish, but following the thread here and on CodeCat's Talk page, it sounds to my ears as though the Finnish authors in the "''accusative doesn't exist''" camp have taken the view that “case” == “distinct endings”.  Meanwhile, those authors in the "''accusative does exist''" camp have taken the view that “case” == “grammatical role”.  My bias is towards the latter.
: Either way, any in-depth treatment of Finnish grammar (perhaps [[WT:About Finnish]]) should at least mention that there are both interpretations, describe them briefly, and explain which interpretation Wiktionary entries adhere to.  &#8209;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 21:59, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

:: (E/C) I see this situation as being very similar to Russian. But even if you (like me) consider that Russian masculine nouns do not have an accusative case, which is instead supplemented by the nominative or genitive depending on animacy, it is not ''wrong'' to call the supplemented form an accusative. Also, history is completely irrelevant, otherwise Modern English has cases as well, only all the endings except for the genitive have merged. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

::*:: In Finnish, like IE, adjectives agree with nouns in case, and that agreement is what is generally considered to be evidence for case-ness in Finnish. Some grammars cite a "prolative" case for Finnish, or several others, but they don't show adjective agreement, so they are not considered true cases. As for English, it has a two-way case distinction in the pronouns, but not in the nouns (I don't consider the possessives a case; they were adjectives historically). So English has cases, but as a closed set and they are not productive. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:47, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

::*:::: Of nouns, yes. But the pronoun possessives were adjectives (or determiners) and agreed in case and number with the noun they modified, like they still do in German and in the Romance and Slavic languages. At least the first- and second-person ones did, but in German the third-person possessives now also inflect, so maybe that happened sometime in English history too before cases disappeared altogether. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:55, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

The point of view that I'm promoting is this (copied from en-Wikipedia article on {{w|accusative}}):
::According to traditional Finnish grammars, the accusative is the case of a total object, while the case of a partial object is the partitive. The <u>accusative is identical either to the nominative or the genitive</u>, except for personal pronouns and the personal interrogative pronoun ''kuka/ken'', which have a special accusative form ending in ''-t''. For example, the accusative form of ''hän'' (he/she) is ''hänet'', and the accusative form of ''kuka'' (or ''ken'') is ''kenet''.
As there are two singular accusative forms, our declension table should show both. If I have not misunderstood, CodeCat argues that only the genitive-looking form is a "true" accusative and therefore only it should be shown. --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 22:22, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
: Hekaheka also showed me this, which I found to be much more convincing evidence:
:: I know I'm walking on thin ice, but the thinking may depend on the fact that in case of personal pronouns (the only true accusative forms that everyone seems to agree on) the accusative is used as equivalent to both nominative and genitive accusatives. At a slave market one might say ''ostan orjan/ osta orja'' but if one uses ''hän'' instead of '' orja'', it becomes ''ostan hänet/ osta hänet''. The grammatical case must be the same both if the object is a noun or if it is a pronoun - ergo, there's a nominative accusative form. In the end, the existence of nominative-accusative is at least partially a question of convention, but this is anyway the convention that is widely agreed upon.
: (my reply, copied from my talk page):
:: Ok, that is an argument that does make some sense to me at least. The fact that the nominative of a noun becomes the accusative of a pronoun shows that there is a functional connection between the two.
:: But then, if we include them both under "accusative" then people may think that they're equivalent and interchangeable. We do the same with alternative genitive and partitive plural forms, after all. So I propose changing the table a bit, so that the "accusative" line becomes two rows high, and have two sub-rows each showing the two possible types of accusative. What should we call those sub-rows? Is the imperative the only case where the second accusative (the one like the nominative) is used, or are there others?
: {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:42, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

* I strongly feel that we should somehow differentiate the two forms. I do not know in what contexts each of them are used, but we can come up with names for those contexts and call them "X accusative" and "Y accusative". --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:46, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
:: As a native speaker of Finnish, I agree with everything Hekaheka has said on the subject. Thousands of Finnish declension tables are erratic now. Either put back the nominative in the accusative singular box, or remove all accusative boxes. User Jyril who created the old declension tables is quite competent too. CodeCat is welcome to invent new rules for Finnish grammar in the discussion rooms, but we cannot base the declension tables on them. --[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 11:59, 27 March 2014 (UTC) It would take several pages to explain the rules when to use nominative or genitive type.

::: There don't seem to be any agreed-upon names for them. One paper I found on the subject labelled them the "n-accusative", "t-accusative" and "zero accusative".

Anything to stop this argument and finally fix the declension tables. --[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 16:33, 28 March 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Makaokalani, let's move into action. CodeCat, forget what I wrote about use of nominative-accusative on your discussion page and check {{w|Accusative case#Finnish}} instead. I erred with some infinitive and participle forms, because normally I don't need to think about them. Sorry for that. 
Anyway, we <u>must</u> change the current way of displaying Finnish accusatives, as it does not conform with any mainstream linguistic theories. I would be totally happy with the system we had, showing genitive-accusative and nominative-accusative forms in singular and nominative-accusative in plural without any further explanations. Those who don't understand why it's that way, may study Finnish grammar from available sources in the net and elsewhere or post a question on the Feedback page. After all, this is not the only unexplained thing in the table. I bet most users unfamiliar with Finnish will have a problem with understanding the concept behind "instructive", just to name one. If further labeling is deemed necessary, I have given one proposal in the discussion we had on CodeCat's discussion page. Another option is to link the word "Accusative" in the declension table to the page ''[[akkusatiivi]]'', which contains some discussion on accusative in Finnish and a link to Wikipedia. --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 20:39, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
: I've modified the table now. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:48, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::Good, thank you. But I still have a complaint about the table headers. The terms "zero?" and "normal" are not an even pair (or even a pair, if you like). The term zero-accusative refers to zero ending and its counterpart is n-accusative in which "n" is not short for "normal" but a reference to the "-n" -ending. Second, this discussion is the first time I ever hear the terms zero-accusative and n-accusative. ''Nominatiiviakkusatiivi'' (nominative-accusative) and ''genetiiviakkusatiivi'' (genitive-accusative) on the other hand seem to be used by many writers and they are also used in both English and Finnish Wikipedia. In order not to confuse the users of various Wiki sources it would probably be recommendable to use consistent terminology across the Wiki projects, even if it's not perfect. Therefore, change "zero?" to "nom." or "nom.acc." and "normal" to "gen." or "gen.acc.", please.  --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 23:13, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::: I'd prefer to avoid those terms as their names are not the clearest. "Genitive accusative" sounds like it's an accusative that is used together with a genitive or something like that. The terms "0-accusative" and "n-accusative" are used in the paper I mentioned, ''The Finnish accusative: Long-distance case assignment under agreement'' by Anne Vainikka and Pauli Brattico ([http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/files/_pubs_Vainikka/accusative11.pdf view]). I just switched it with "normal" because it is the normal default accusative case form, and because having just "zero" and "n" looks strange and doesn't say much. With the name "normal" it's clearer to readers that in most circumstances that's the accusative you should use. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:25, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Would it be clear? The nominative accusative could also be called "normal" because accusative plural is always identical with the nominative.

== French open vowels ==

French has two open vowel phonemes, /a/ and /ɑ/, but many speakers make no or little difference between them, even though there exists minimal pairs. Therefore, either the underlying phoneme is /a/ or /ɑ/, pronunciation is often written down with only /a/ representing these two phonemes; and when one encounters /a/, one can never be sure that is a /a/ indeed.

To solve this issue, I think we should consider using /a/ where the underlying phoneme is not known or usage varies, and /æ/ where the underlying phoneme is /a/ indeed. That policy would not break any previously written entry as /a/ is confusing anyway.

What do you think of this proposition? – [[User:Pylade|Pylade]] ([[User talk:Pylade|talk]]) 20:59, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Hello. Wiktionary has been getting quite a few spambots recently, most of which are blocked by some lovely abusefilters. However, it would be very useful to be able to get CheckUser data for those accounts, which could be used to prevent spam elsewhere. All of the current CheckUsers here are inactive, so would it be possible to elect some new ones, or modify the local checkuser policy to allow stewards to check locally in cross-wiki cases, such as anti-spam? Regards, [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] ([[User talk:Ajraddatz|talk]]) 04:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

:To expand on my earlier comment (aware that this is ''somewhat'' tangential)... allowing inactive users to retain admin rights, as en.Wikt often does, is one thing; it can even be useful, in that it allows the users to immediately resume blocking vandals and deleting vandalism if they do return for short spurts of activity. Allowing inactive users to retain checkuser rights is different. Checkusers are in a powerful position to invade other users' privacy. <br>I stumbled across an old thread some time ago in which someone had proposed requiring that people undergo checkuser checking before being granted things like adminship. An admin had replied that he would be wary of that, since he actually had to change accounts because someone had stalked him under his previous wiki account and in real life. <br>Accordingly, checkusers should be people who are very active, because they should be people who are trusted by the ''current'' community (not just the community of users who elected them and then themselves became inactive). They shouldn't be just minimally active (en.WP requires one edit per year to retain admin rights, I think), they should be so active that the ''current'' community knows them; otherwise, the community isn't in a position to evaluate their trustworthiness. Also, checkusers should be people who are very active so that they can respond to situations as they arise. It's not as useful for an inactive checkuser to return seven months from now and tell us who was running the spambots. <br>Also, the Meta Checkuser policy states: "On any wiki, there must be at least two users with CheckUser status, or none at all. This is so that they can mutually control and confirm their actions. In the case where only one CheckUser is left on a wiki (when the only other one retires, or is removed), the community must appoint a new CheckUser immediately (so that the number of CheckUsers is at least two)." [...] "Any user account with CheckUser status that is inactive for more than a year will have their CheckUser access removed." <br>Looking at [[Special:ListUsers/checkuser]], we are violating the spirit of that, if not the letter:

<-I pop by here periodically to see if anyone is looking for me, but most of my activity these days is on en.wiki. I used to do xwiki spambot checking here, but since I haven't been on IRC much I don't get the requests anymore.

Is there any objection to letting stewards use the checkuser tool on this wiki for anti-spam work in the meantime, i.e. until such time as we have more active checkusers? Or would we have to have a vote in order to allow that, which wouldn't actually take any less time than electing new checkusers? lol.

:This is very informative, thank you! It seems two of the checkusers have been semi-active, while two have been totally inactive with the tool for years. I have drafted a vote to remove the two inactive users' checkuser bits: [[WT:Votes/cu-2014-04/De-checkusering inactive checkusers]]. Votes on electing new, fully active checkusers can come later.

:Well, I initially postponed the vote so that we could discuss what level of community support would be required for a user to retain rights vs lose them. Some users were of the opinion that rights (like blocks) are granted to people that the community thinks should have them, and if there is no longer a (vote-passage-sized, e.g. ~2/3) majority of the community which thinks the users should have the rights/be blocked, the rights/blocks should be rescinded. (This philosophy prevailed in a vote on unblocking a certain user, but debates over user rights have been different.) Other users were of the opinion that once a user was given rights, they should retain them unless a sufficiently large (vote-passage-sized) majority favoured removing them. Like many discussions here, that discussion petered out without a clear conclusion. I would suggest restarting it (probably in a new thread) before restarting the vote.

Also note that if 2 CUs resign or are otherwise removed somehow, CU would go back to the stewards, since there must be >2 CUs or none at all.

== A Different Way To Look At Chinese? ==

I've been doing some thinking about Chinese, trying to sort out the implications of the different ways we've treated the Chinese lects. I can't say that I have a clear solution, but I have the inklings of what seems to me like a more rational conceptual framework. It may be incompatible with our current infrastructure, but here it is: 

Let's assume that Chinese is a strictly written language, originally based on an earlier spoken lect, but that has developed since on its own independent of the spoken language(s). In this respect, it reminds me a lot of sign languages such as American Sign Language.

The "dialects" are independent, but strictly spoken languages which are translated into dialects of written Chinese when they are written. That makes written Chinese a sort of lingua franca that's used to communicate between speakers, though the example of the [[w:Code Talker]]s comes to mind, as well.

Following from that, Chinese would be considered a language, but so would Cantonese, Hakka, Mandarin, Min Nan, Wu, Xiang, etc (and/or some of their subdivisions and/or fellow members of their dialect groups, as well).

Some aspects would be complementary in distribution: pronunciation would be strictly for the spoken lects and orthography for the written one. Morphology and syntax, on the other hand, are partly tied in with the writing, but have dimensions that the writing simply doesn't address. Etymology of the spoken lects is quite different from that of the written, but there again, intertwined with it. Lexicon is also quite distinct, but there are regional terms in the writing and I'm sure the writing contributes to the spoken lects as well.

I'm not sure if this is developed enough to provide anything useful, but I thought I would present it and see what others think.

Comments? [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 20:21, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

: NB: A 'classical chinese' (WMF lang code zh-classical) written dialect dates from at least the 9th century ce, while an updated 'vernacular chinese' (WMF lang code zh) written dialect dates from at least the 20th century ce. The former is understood across a broader base of languages, the latter is understood by a larger population group. - [[User:Amgine|Amgine]]/<sup> [[User talk:Amgine|t]]&middot;[[Special:EmailUser/Amgine|e]]</sup> 17:24, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

::Most of the modern written Chinese is basically the same across all Chinese varieties, e.g. standard written Cantonese only differs from standard Chinese (Mandarin) in style and word choices, pronunciation (when read out loud) and use of traditional Chinese (e.g. in Hong Kong) (the latter is not really a difference, since Mandarin is also written in traditional characters in Taiwan and Cantonese is written in simplified characters in [[Guangdong]]). Vernacular forms of dialects when written down differ more from standard Chinese as there are very common words, which are not used in Mandarin or have a different meaning. The specific words are very low in number, even if they are very common, every day words.  Some spoken dialects simply lack the writing form or is not common and attestable.

== Automatizing {{temp|rhymes}} with Lua, merging it into {{temp|IPA}}, and reforms in pronunciation section ==

Automatizing {{temp|rhymes}} looks feasible. The template that takes IPA pronunciation can generate the title of the corresponding rhymes page (at least for English, I don't know about rules of rhymes in other languages). Any opinions/objections about automatizing it?

On the other hand, the structure of pronunciation sections of Wiktionary looks quite stupid and needs some reform:
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈwɔːtə(ɹ)/|a=UK}}
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈwɔtɚ/|a=US}}, {{enPR|wôtər}}
:* {{audio|en|En-uk-water.ogg|Audio (UK)}}
:* {{audio|en|en-us-water.ogg|Audio (US)}}
:* {{rhymes|en|ɔːtə(ɹ)|ɒtə(ɹ)}}
Note how things such as the word "Audio" and the accent labels ("UK", "US") and the symbols (ɔːtə(ɹ), ɒtə(ɹ)) are being repeated. Maybe it should be something like:<!--Commented out to prevent template errors.
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈw[[Rhymes:English:-ɔːtə(ɹ)|ɔːtə(ɹ)]]/|a=UK}} {{audio|en|En-uk-water.ogg}}
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈw[[Rhymes:English:-ɒtə(ɹ)|ɒtɚ]]/|a=US}}, {{enPR|wôtər}} {{audio|en|en-us-water.ogg}}
Also: {{IPAchar|/ˈw[[Rhymes:English:-ɔːtə(ɹ)|ɔːtə(ɹ)/ <small>(rhymes)</small>]]}}
-->

: The main problem is that the English rhymes pages are currently normalized for one regional variant, so that there will be duplicate rhyme pages for different regional realizations of the same phoneme. This highlights another issue: do we want to create a rhyme page for every variant that anyone ever puts in an IPA template? Some people mark things like aspirated and unreleased stops, or represent an artificial-sounding spelling pronunciation, while others just don't understand IPA and make mistakes.

== Über-template with tabular output for pronunciation section ==

This is inspired by opinions from [[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahagn Petrosyan]] and [[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]].

We can create a single, Lua-powered template for pronunciation section, which would generate a table similar to that of below. This template would be able to automatically generate IPA pronunciation for certain languages (for now, only ready for Armenian, Georgian, Polish, Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Ukrainian and to some extent for Persian and Ancient Greek), possibly rhymes (discussion at above), and hyphenation (for American English, etc.) wherever possible. (these are feasible from technical aspect)

Both output and input of the proposed template are more readable and the output doesn't have duplications that can be seen in the current format. It also takes and shows information more precisely (in the current format of our pronunciation sections, it is often unclear which, say, audio, or which homophone corresponds to which IPA pronunciation when there's more than one phonemic pronunciation for a given accent, which is the case for "US" here):

*'''Support''' the general idea, but I don't think linking the pronunciation straight to the rhymes is a good idea, for a few reasons. First, because it's not at all clear to the reader that it should link to rhymes, as it doesn't say "rhymes" anywhere in the box. Second, because this eliminates the possibility of adding helpful tooltips indicating what sounds each symbol is for. (I think this would be quite helpful, as many readers don't know IPA. I set up something like this for Wikipedia at [[w:Module:IPAc]], but it never got used.) Third, because this way rhymes can't be shown at all if the full pronunciation details aren't available. In many cases, a user will be able to add that one word rhymes with another word just be using the rhymes adding tool, even if they don't know IPA and thus wouldn't be able to add the full IPA pronunciation. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 20:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

::Umm....I don't know if this is at all relevant, but I just created a new Ancient Greek pronunciation template, {{temp|grc-pron}}, which can be seen in action at {{m|grc|εὐδοκέω}}.  If this template is to become the community standard, then I imagine the results from grc-pron could be piped into it.  I also assume that the bits not relevant to a language, like rhymes aren't relevant to Ancient Greek, for example, could be turned off.  Finally, I haven't finished the JS for this yet, but I was planning on making my new template collapse into one line by default, showing a general gist of the word's phonological evolution, which would be expandable to the current five lines of detail.  I would strongly prefer to keep the ability to show the general user a fairly compact, simple pronunciation scheme, while allowing the more serious phonophile more detail.  I feel fairly confident that most users don't give a rat shit about most of this info, and assaulting their above-the-line load-screen with it is unacceptable.  Again, I don't know if this is relevant, and I do apologize if my grc blinders have caused me to insert myself somewhere I don't belong.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 08:13, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

===Implementation===

There are a few things that need to be sorted out, as the parameters given above are a nice ideal, but there are some practical problems.
* Hyphenation is not actually a pronunciation thing, so it probably doesn't belong in the pronunciation section, let alone in this table. It's also redundant to list it for each pronunciation as it's going to be pronunciation-independent.
* The suggested way of specifying parameters doesn't say anything about the order in which the columns should be shown. While you can specify parameters in a different order on calling the template, this information is lost in the translation to Lua or the template. So the module would have no way of knowing that IPA goes before audio, unless we hard-code it into the module itself. That, of course, means that we'd have to maintain a list of valid columns, and reject any that are not recognised. It's not ideal.
* Consider also the changes that are in progress with Chinese entries. They also use a table structure but it expands. See for example [[User:Wyang/告白]]. It may not be the best thing to have one format for Chinese and another for all other languages. So we may want to consider a way to accommodate both.
* What should go in the first column when there is only one pronunciation?
{{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:46, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
::IMO the column names and their order should be hard-coded.

:::American hyphenation is based on pronunciation. British hyphenation is based on etymology.

The data is hard coded for now, I want to make a separate module (named /templates) which handles calling from templates. That way, the current module is focused only on Lua, and doesn't need to concern itself with details of how it's invoked. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:02, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

It looks good. The plain version is better, because the table lines and tone are just visual distraction. It would be more readable if every header and body cell were left-aligned.

If there is only one line and no accent, can the first column be omitted?

I agree that hyphenation doesn’t really belong here.

:Like many languages, English has a very large number of dialects. At present, people can add information on these dialects' pronunciations of words rather simply: they just copy a line of the current format and change the {{temp|a}}, expanding
<pre>
* {{IPA|/maɪt /|lang=en|a=GenAm}}
* {{IPA|/mɑːt/|lang=en|a=Southern US}}

* {{IPA|/mɑːt/|lang=en|a=Southern US}}
* {{IPA|/mæːt/|lang=en|a=Old Virginia accent}}
</pre>
:and {{temp|a}} is flexible enough to handle this. Your proposed format seems to use dialects' names in the names of parameters ("UK-IPA=", "UK-audio=", etc). Does this mean we would have to anticipate and code into the template/module, in advance, every dialect of every language that the template covered, or people would not be able to add those dialects' pronunciations of words? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 01:29, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
:: Lua is capable of iterating over all parameters. So it's able to "find" parameters whose name is not known in advance. It does require that the parameters follow some predictable pattern so that the module knows which part of the name it should interpret as a dialect name. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Yes. But there is also a nice solution to avoid problems such as following restricted patterns and long names for parameters: (for 2nd row)
<pre>
|2= US
|2-IPA= ...
|2-audio= ...
</pre>
::: this way, we'd be able to put more than one dialect/variety in a single row: by passing them to a numbered parameter, separated by comma or something: {{para|2|UK, US}}. We can also define subvarieties which would be placed in the second column, by passing them to {{para|''n''-''n''}} where ''n'''s are numbers, which is especially useful in Chinese entries.
:::Regarding columns, and whether they should be hard-coded, I think specific columns should be defined with a default order, but we should probably be allowed to override it by defining new columns and their order using special parameters, like {{para|column''n''}}.
:::If the {{para|''n''}} parameters are not specified (usually when we have only one row), the first column should be omitted.
:::I think hyphenation belong somewhere in PoS section, near headword line where we show the word, maybe floating on the right side, like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User:ZxxZxxZ/sandbox&oldid=26087029 this].

::::I support the idea of using a single template to cover all the English pronunciation information. In the case of English, it might be useful to pre-define some commonly used dialectal names, such as 'UK', 'RP', 'US', 'GenAm', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Ireland', 'New Zealand' and 'South Africa', so that one can use
<pre>
{{pronunciation|lang=en
|UK-IPA= ...
}}
</pre>

::::without having to identify the variety in a separate parameter. The case of Chinese is a little different from English, as the internal divisions of Chinese are well-defined from centuries of Chinese dialectology (Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, etc.), with each division having a prestige dialect (usually the dialect of the largest city), whereas English accents are less well-defined. Regional Chinese accents are associated with locations ({{w|List of varieties of Chinese}}, eg. Beijing, Guangzhou), while English accents tend to be characterised by region/area (eg. Southern US). Hence, I would prefer if {{temp|zh-pron}} has parameters 'm=PINYIN', 'c=JYUTPING', 'w=ROMANISATION' for prestige dialects, and 'm-LOCATION_A=IPA', 'm-LOCATION_B=IPA' for other varieties. In contrast, the English template is probably better without a set of predefined divisions (as the example above |1= ... |2= ...), but with some predefined commonly used parameters, as said above. As for rhymes, I think they should be kept separate from the IPA template. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 03:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users. 

For more information:

== Words used "in dialects, including A, B, C" ==

Quite a few entries use the labels "dialectal", "dialect" and "dialects". This is allowable, because sometimes a user may not know which dialects a word is used in. But we should always ''attempt'' to be more specific, IMO. I'd like to make people aware of the label "including", which allows listing dialects in a way that makes clear the list isn't exhaustive. E.g. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=favor&type=revision&diff=33158759&oldid=33158345 in the entry ''favor'']: {{temp|lb|en|transitive|in|_|dialects|including|Southern US|and|Cajun}} → {{lb|en|transitive|in|_|dialects|including|Southern US|and|Cajun}}. (I can also find evidence that the sense was used in British dialects a century ago; I don't know whether it still is or not.)

== Flash card function for language learning publicly requested ==

In [http://niamey.blogspot.com/2015/07/wiktionary-as-tool-for-african-language.html this blog article] the author suggests the desirability of having the Wiktionaries offer a flash-card like system for learning African languages. The advantage of hosting such a system is that it would offer the opportunity for teachers or advocates of the language to add entries to the languages of interest to them to achieve sufficient language coverage to make the effort worthwhile. This came up on the Wiktionary-l mailing list, so we should try to make as constructive response as possible.

== Presentation of Katharevousa Greek in en:Wiktionary. ==

I currently treat Katharevousa as shown [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B8%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%AF#Greek here], entering it as an alternative form of the Standard Modern Greek one. Where an SMG form does not exist I would define it thus:<br>
:1. (''[[Katharevousa]]'') suitable translation<br>

Does this seem the appropriate treatment. Are there better, different examples in other languages? <br>

There are two distinct "areas": "polytonic orthography" is the one and the other is "Katharevousa". "Katharevousa" has only "polytonic orthography" but "Demotic Greek" (official language of Greece since 1976) was also printed in "polytonic orthography" (officially until 1982).  But there are polytonic forms that belong purely to "Demotic Greek" (βασιληᾶς or βασιλιᾶς). Also  "Demotic Greek" is not a "descendant" of "Katharevousa". But there are many words created (most translated or transliterated) during the period where "Katharevousa" was official language and thus can be somehow stated that come from "Katharevousa".  IMHO "Katharevousa" should be used only if form has only "polytonic orthography" and the printed word cannot be treated as a polytonic form of a word in use.

== eye dialect ing ==

I'm curious about the policy on eye dialect spellings of ing verbs in English. For example we have ''[[walkin']]'' but not ''[[buyin']]''. AFAICT none of the eye dialect spellings are cited. Is there a special policy on when to include them? Just to pick an obscure verb, with a little casual googling I found a use for [https://books.google.com/books?id=BiHeHTaeZAsC&pg=PA12&dq=transmogrifyin%27&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8uSXVZPbGIm0-QHzvYH4Dg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=transmogrifyin%27&f=false transmogrifyin'] -- just one, but if I could find one barely looking, I bet there are more out there. Do we make pages for every English verb where someone has written it like that enough times to meet CFI? Are we actually required to find examples? There are no examples for any eye dialect words I've checked including some ones I'd have been surprising to find in writing, like ''[[agonizin']]'' and ''[[considerin']]'' (neither of which have any easy to find results on Google Books). Just curious if this has been discussed, I don't plan on mass-making these pages or nominating them for deletion or anything like that.

:I personally consider them less useful than "common misspellings", as the general rule of dropping the "g" becomes obvious to a language learner rather quickly.

:Personally, I can think of some guidelines I've been applying to them when possible:
:* Language should be in the title: In 2010 [[Appendix:Dictionary-only terms]] was moved to [[Appendix:English dictionary-only terms]]. Glossaries would be an exception ([[Appendix:Glossary of legal terms]] and the like) because most of those are lists of English words without "English" in the name, but I'm not very happy about that because we could have FL versions of those, like [[Appendix:Glossary of Portuguese legal terms]], actual appendix name TBD.
:* Place all language-specific appendices in language-specific appendix categories, e.g. I believe [[Appendix:English nouns]] should either be in [[:Category:English appendices]] or a suitable subcategory, in this case [[:Category:English grammar appendices]]. In the past many appendices were in the main language category such as [[:Category:English language]].
:* Sometimes a page is moved between Appendix<->Wiktionary namespaces, this would be because appendices are of interest outside of the scope of Wiktionary, Wiktionary namespace is for Wiktionary policies.

== Using BBC Voices as a source ==

A few years ago, the BBC organized a large series of conversations between members of the public across the country about their dialects/accents. This information is now [http://sounds.bl.uk/Accents-and-dialects/BBC-Voices maintained by the British Library] (so we can assume it's permanently archived) and although the files don't have full transcripts (just summaries), it's still a useful source for a lot of terms that are difficult to archive. To pick a random example, several participants in [http://sounds.bl.uk/Accents-and-dialects/BBC-Voices/021M-C1190X0009XX-0401V0 the Hartlepool conversation] use the word [[cuddy-wifter]]/[[cuddywifter]], which is difficult to cite even in its standard meaning of "left-handed person" (only one non-mention on Google Books), but as comes out in the course of the chat it has an additional meaning on [[Teesside]] of "[[Catholic]]". Given that a lot of the problems that we have with collecting dialectal terms is that they are often used in speech but seldom written down, can we use this archive as a citation?

:''The Penguin Writer's Manual'' (2004, {{ISBN|0141924829}} says this:

[...] Proper nouns include people's first names and surnames, the names of places, times, events, and institutions, and the titles of books, films, etc. They are spelt with an initial capital letter: ''Sam'', ''Shakespeare'', ''New York'', ''October'', ''Christmas'', ''Christianity'', ''Marxism'', and ''Coronation Street''. All nouns that are not proper nouns are known as '''common nouns'''. [...]
:: Apart from being spelt with an initial capital letter, proper nouns have other characteristics that usually distinguish them from common nouns. They do not, generally, have a plural and they are not, usually, preceded by ''a'' or ''an''. There is only one ''Australia''; there was only one ''Genghis Khan''. [...] there are many exceptions to [this]. There are occasions when either a specific example or several examples of something denoted by a common noun must be referred to: ''keeping up with '''the Joneses'''''; [...] ''one of the warmest '''Januaries''' on record''.
: The manual then goes on to describe concrete nouns (like ''table'') and abstract nouns (like ''happiness'' and ''unity''), countable nouns (''table'' again) and uncountable nouns (''mud'', ''foliage''), and collective nouns (''flock'').

: '''Comment:''' While there are some borderline cases, such as the names of months and days, most nouns can be readily distinguished as common or proper. The actual ''criteria'' and grammar of proper nouns are of far more debate, albeit philosophical. The problem arises in that the names of abstractions and philosophies behave grammatically much like proper nouns. Is {{m|en|socialism}} a common noun or a proper noun? In older texts, it was capitalized and treated much like {{m|en|Confucianism}} or {{m|en|Christianity}}.  All three are philosophies. Further, capitalization cannot always be relied upon as a guide, since a number of common nouns and even adjectives are capitalized by virtue of their etymological source (e.g. {{m|en|Welshman}}, {{m|en|French dressing}}, {{m|en|African}}). --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 20:27, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

== Language labels within Translingual citations ==

At the moment we have 30 pages in [[:Category:Translingual citations]].

I found them to lack consistency as some of those had only a "English citations" section while others had a "Translingual citations" section without specifying which language is each citation. So I am trying a new format to standardize them all.

See [[Citations:VL]]. I separated the citations with language-specific labels within the "Translingual citations of VL" section. I also put them in the respective language categories: [[:Category:English citations]], etc. (Maybe something like [[:Category:Translingual citations in English]] could be an improvement. Still, maybe this level of granularity is not necessary now because there are only few of those citations. If we had hundreds of Translingual citations I might think differently.) I made sure all the 30 pages are following this new format at the moment. I'd like some feedback to see if other people like this format or it could be improved some other way.

Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:30, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

:::@[[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]]: I disagree with you on this point. IMO, having "Translingual citations" mirroring the Translingual section of the entry itself is useful because allows us to group different language citations into the same senses. See [[Citations:(]], specifically sense "Punctuation mark: expands a word into another word, inflection or spelling"; it has both Portuguese and English examples. It could have even dozens of languages in the future. It serves for easier comparison of how the same specific sense is used, to check if the Translingual definition is true in all languages. Current sense at [[(]] is inaccurate. It is: "Begins denoting an alternative option for a '''preceding''' word. / dog(s)", but there are citations with "colo(u)r" and "(re)criação" (Portuguese). For punctuation marks, one could even argue that one sense of a punctuation mark is truly "Translingual" if it has been attested in multiple languages; [[¿]] has only the Spanish section. But taxonomic names would be truly Translingual even if attested in only one language, I hope: [[Citations:Anous stolidus]] has only one Portuguese citation at the moment. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 02:21, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
::The Translingual case shows that the naming convention for the citations categories assumes there to be no difference between the language label for the term and the language label for the citation. AFAICT only Translingual violates the assumption, though Translingual itself is a highly heterogeneous collection of ideograms, symbols, taxonomic names, and other scientific names. Arguably it should also include Latin-derived term that appear in medical, legal, even alchemical running text of many languages.
::IMO, Any citation pages for Translingual terms should remain where they are and those pages should be categorized as Translingual, eg, the current [[:Category:Translingual citations]]. IMO, there could certainly be additional categorization into categories for the language in which the translingual term is embedded in each citation. This would enable the citation to be found and reused for citing the terms of its language that it includes and subjected to any language-specific maintenance that might be required. 
::I don't see any great advantage to having a category like [[:Category:Translingual citations in English]] rather than two categories: [[:Category:Translingual citations]] and [[:Category:English citations]], but one disadvantage: there is no simple single category that contains all the pages bearing in whatever content namespace that have all the citations in each language.

::::: I think the Chinese entries are a possible model: we should have a collapsible pronunciation table along the lines of the translation table, since the same symbol is read out loud in different languages and dialects as [[period]], [[full stop]], [[point]], [[Punkt]], etc. One problem to deal with: scientific names, at least, also have syntactic information in various languages. For instance, scientific usage in English is to refer to "the family [[Malvaceae]]", but a lot of people who aren't familiar with this refer to "the [[Malvaceae]] family". Another is that scientific names are more often read than heard, so pronunciation can vary widely from person to person: I would pronounce [[Malvaceae]] as something like /malˈvej si ej/, but I often see the pronunciation given as /malˈvej si i/. Writing for the public on pronouncing scientific names tends to say things like "there's no one right way to say it- everyone is different". This is especially true when scientific names are based on names of people: if one recognizes the name, one may pronounce it after the pronunciation of the person's name, rather than by the usual rules. For example, "hopei" might be pronounced as two syllables or three, depending on whether one notices that it's based on the surname [[Hope]].

The prescriptive back-constructed Classical Latin pronunciations are not actually used by modern scientists in the area of taxonomy. For example, the genus of [[pine]] is ''[[Pinus]]'', which in Classical Latin sounds exactly like English {{term|penis}}, so only the most eccentric of taxonomists uses that pronunciation. Even the family names in botany vary wildly in their use pronunciations by country, and none of them use the Classical-style pronunciation that I have ever heard (and I've heard US, UK, Danish, French, and Portuguese botanists). 
::::::::: So, what would be the point of prescribing pronunciations that no one actually uses? If we're going to include pronunciations for scientific taxon names, then I would suggest we limit ourselves to those pronunciations found in English-speaking countries, and include as a matter of course, a link to a page where the variability of these names in other cultures is explained with some examples. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 20:41, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::That seems like a sensible recommendation. It would give English users of Wiktionary some clue about one or more intelligible (descriptive) pronunciations and might provide hints relevant to other languages, such as stress pattern, diphthongs, or diaeresis, hard vs soft ''c'' and ''ch'', etc, which probably apply across many languages.

== "Audio" in front of pron files for non-pluricentric languages ==

Do languages that do not have several very well established regional varieties (an example of this could be English (US), English (UK), English (Aus), etc.) need the text "Audio" [[prepended]] before their pronunciation file players? [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 20:31, 9 July 2015 (UTC)

'''Proposal for a "best practices" recommendation''': "Audio" before a pronunciation file should be used only in the presence of some other qualifier. It is otherwise redundant As bullet points are used to itemize/list text, a bullet point is not to be used either (because a Flash element is not text.) (Ping some users whose editing involves pronunciation files [[User:Pereru]], [[User:Panda10]], anyone else welcome to express their opinion.)

Pronunciations would be formatted in the following way for pluricentric languages languages:

* {{IPA|en|/ˈpɝsən/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-person.ogg|a=US}}
* {{audio|en|En-uk-person.ogg|a=UK}}

And the following way for languages whose pronunciation files usually do not feature additional qualifiers:

* {{lv-IPA|akustice}}
* {{audio|lv|lv-riga-akustiķe.ogg}}

or

* {{IPA|hu|/ˈɒmɛrikɒ/}}
* {{audio|hu|Hu-Amerika.ogg}}
* {{hyphenation|hu|Ame|ri|ka}}

'''Modified 2nd version''': "Audio" is not to be used in the absence of some other qualifier but bullet point must be used.

'''3rd version''': "Audio" is not to be used in the absence of some other qualifier. An editor can choose whether to use a bullet point. ({{template|IPA}} ''doesn't appear to be checking for namespace when adding categories the IPA examples should be removed from this page at some point or namespace-checking/cat suppression should be added to the template''.)

:I think the bullet point should be retained in all cases. It makes the flash element align with the other things, and gives them all the same visual 'introduction' (a bullet point); it also makes the edit window more legible, IMO; furthermore, it helps when indentation is used: for example, if audio were added to [[impact]], it could be indented under the 'noun' and 'verb' lines (although see [[object]] for another way of presenting such information; we are not consistent).
:If we were to drop "Audio" from non-pluricentric languages, could we just drop it from all languages? Then we would have:
* {{IPA|en|/ˈpɝsən/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-person.ogg|a=US}}
* {{audio|en|En-uk-person.ogg|a=UK}}
:and
* {{lv-IPA|akustice}}
* {{audio|lv|lv-riga-akustiķe.ogg}}
:[[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:22, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

::I prefer the bullet point NOT to be retained -- the result is that the flash element is placed right under the pronunciation transcription to which it refers, as part of the same paragraph -- which to me is more logical: the pronunciation file is not a separate pronunciation, a separate item in a list of possible pronunciations, but an ''actual realization of the same pronunciation that was transcribed with the IPA right above it'', i.e. logically part of the same paragraph. (I might even prefer it if the flash element occurred in the same line and after the actual IPA transcription; but occurring right under it is also OK.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:56, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

:: I'm fine with removing the "Audio" label. If there are qualifiers, they can be displayed without the "Audio" label. It would also be fine removing the bullets but without them two or more audio templates will be displayed in a single line. It doesn't look good. Maybe you can modify the audio template to resolve this. Leaving the use of bullets optional is probably not a good policy. Some editors would use it, others won't. It would create too much inconsistency in the layout. I assume the new standards will be implemented by a bot and they will continued to be checked after every edit. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 12:44, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

==Old Italic standardization proposals==

I've recently been working on [[Module:Ital-translit]] and [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and have come to the point where I need some oppinions. The <tt>Ital</tt> code block does not currently possess all the characters needed fully to encode all the languages that use it; so I propose the following rules to standardize the <tt>Ital</tt>'s use. Previous conversations maybe found at [[User talk:JohnC5#Testing transliteration modules]] and [[WT:Beer parlour/2013/June#South Picene alphabet]].

===Proposal 1:All entries should be written left-to-right===

The majority (if not all) of the languages that use <tt>Ital</tt> are written [[boustrophedon]] and thus could have lemmata appearing in left-to-right or right-to-left order. Modern scholarship, however, tends to merely unspool the inscriptions and then present them in left-to-right order. I therefore propose that all languages using <tt>Ital</tt> should be lemmatized in left-to-right order.

: '''Support'''. This is proper use of Unicode, because Ital is encoded as left-to-right. If we ever decide to make some piece of Old Italic text in boustrophedon or right-to-left, it should be done with HTML, never by typing it backwards like some have suggested. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|falai]])</sup>'' 14:00, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. I second everything Ungoliant said above. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 16:56, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

: '''Support''' ''per'' [[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]]. It would be wonderful if we could have a template to wrap Old Italic quotations which would present the text boustrophedon. — [[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 18:27, 21 July 2015 (UTC)

===Proposal 2:Allow alternative use of Ital characters===

For much of <tt>Ital</tt> script, the character may be transcribed unambiguously or with only minor phonetic deviations from the canonical. Examples are represented be a <span style="background:#C0CFE4;">blue</span> box in [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and include:
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌂}}: canonical - '''''c'''''; Camunic, Oscan, South Picene, Noric, North Picene - '''''g'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌅}}: canonical - '''''v'''''; Old Latin - '''''f'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌈}}: canonical - '''''θ'''''; Umbrian - '''''t'''''; Noric - '''''d'''''
However, in some cases, one language may use one glyph to represent an entirely different sound (whether by innovation of a new but similar letterform or by reällocation of a previous letterform). Examples are represented be a <span style="background:#FF3232;">red</span> box in [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and include:
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌁}}: canonical - '''''b'''''; Camunic - '''''ś'''''; Raetic - '''''tʼ / þ'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌑}}: canonical - '''''ś'''''; Camunic - '''''b'''''; South Picene - '''''í'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌣}}: canonical - '''''50'''''; Camunic - '''''þ'''''; Faliscan - '''''f'''''
I therefore propose the use of the character which most closely resembles the letterform in a particular language. Therefore South Picene ''matereíh'' should be lemmatize as {{m|spx|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄𐌑𐌇|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄'''𐌑'''𐌇}} and not {{m|spx|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄𐌝𐌇|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄'''𐌝'''𐌇}}. The rules will be those set forth in [[Appendix:Old Italic script]]

: '''Support'''. I see no reason against this. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 16:59, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

: My initial reaction is to '''oppose'''. As was just noted [[Wiktionary:Grease pit/2015/July#Add_to_the_ranges_of_Arabic_characters_in_Module:scripts.2Fdata|in the Grease Pit]], "б in Serbian is sometimes displayed differently from the б in Russian", but we don't handle this by using a different character for Serbian б in an attempt to mimic its shape. For Runic, we make do with [[ᛊ]] or [[ᛋ]], even when the inscription clearly has [[:File:Runic letter sowilo variant.svg|S]]. If Unicode has encoded something as, for example, "LETTER SHE", and we use it in spelling a word which is actually spelled with "LETTER II", I don't see how readers are supposed to figure out that the word isn't spelled with ''she'' (and wonkily transliterated by us).

: ''Re'' "in some cases, one language may use one glyph to represent an entirely different sound (whether by innovation of a new but similar letterform or by reällocation of a previous letterform)", I suppose there is an important theoretical difference between innovational homoglyphs and reällocated glyphs; the former simply doesn't exist in the encoded repertoire, whilst it is perfectly appropriate to transcribe the latter in whatever noncanonical way according to the reällocation of a given language. I doubt that the distinction has any more than theoretical importance, however, so I find myself inclined to '''support''' the use of noncanonical transcriptions where a given language calls for it. — [[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 18:27, 21 July 2015 (UTC)

===Proposal 3:Add extra characters into Ital temporarily===

The interpunct {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}}, two dot punctuation {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}}, and tricolon {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁝}} are all variously used as word separators in <tt>Ital</tt> languages and should be used as punctuation in entries. Furthermore, South Picene (always the culprit) uses {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}} to represent the letter '''''o''''' and {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}} for the letter '''''f'''''. Thus the entry {{m|spx|mefiín}} contains the quotation:
* {{ux|spx|𐌀𐌐𐌀𐌄𐌔⁝𐌒𐌖𐌐𐌀[𐌕?⁝𐌄?]𐌔𐌌𐌑𐌍⁝𐌐𐌞𐌐𐌞𐌍𐌉𐌔⁝𐌍𐌑𐌓⁝'''𐌌𐌄⁚𐌉𐌑𐌍'''⁝𐌅𐌄𐌉𐌀𐌕⁝𐌅𐌄𐌐𐌄𐌕𐌑|translation=The nobleman lies, the chief of the Picenes (?) is (?), '''in the middle''' of the tomb.}}
Until such time as Unicode adds one-, two-, and three-dot word-separators to the <tt>Ital</tt> code block, {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}} (U+00B7), {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}} (U+205A), and {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁝}} (U+205D) should be used in entries and, in the case of South Picene, in page names ({{m|spx|mefiín}} should be moved to {{m|spx|𐌌𐌄⁚𐌉𐌑𐌍}}).

: '''Oppose'''. This is improper use of Unicode. It’s no different than using | (pipe) instead of I (capital i). I prefer using transliteration since the script variant used by South Picene is clearly not covered well enough by Unicode, but using 𐌏 and 𐌚 are also a better solution. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|falai]])</sup>'' 13:53, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

===Proposal 4:Page names should be in Ital when applicable===

For several of these languages (Old Latin most notably), there may exist a corpus written in the <tt>Latn</tt> alphabet. The majority of the languages exist primarily in their version of the <tt>Ital</tt> alphabet and should be lemmatized as such. It is the scholarly practice to place words transcribed from <tt>Ital</tt> in '''boldface''' and those found in <tt>Latn</tt> in ''italics'' or roman. Where possible, we should strive to put words found in <tt>Ital</tt> or <tt>Latn</tt> according to their appearance in the source. The major offender at this point is Faliscan, the majority of [[:Category:Faliscan lemmas|whose entries]], I suspect, should be in <tt>Ital</tt> (also, {{m|xfa|-el̄u}} shouldn't have a macron in the page name).

== Collapse multiple inflection-of definitions into one with subsenses? ==

I've always been bothered by entries like {{m|la|agri}} and {{m|la|aquae}}. There's no need to repeat "of (word)" four times on separate lines. So I'm thinking it would be good to extend {{temp|inflection of}} so that you can specify distinct multiple inflections instead of just one. These would be displayed as subsenses, so that {{m|la|aquae}} would look like:

# <span class='form-of-definition'>inflections of <span class='form-of-definition-link'><i class="Latn mention" lang="la">[[aqua#Latin|aqua]]</i></span>:</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#nominative_case|nominative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#plural_number|plural]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#genitive_case|genitive]] [[Appendix:Glossary#singular_number|singular]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#dative_case|dative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#singular_number|singular]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#vocative_case|vocative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#plural_number|plural]]</span>

I think this would look a ''lot'' better, and above all there is only one link to the lemma rather than 3 extra redundant ones. We can also make the list of subsenses collapsible in cases where there's too many (like for German adjectives).

To implement this, {{temp|inflection of}} would need some way to indicate how to separate multiple inflections. This would have to be some kind of special tag that is inserted as a separator, like: {{temp|inflection of|aqua||nom|p|(sep)|gen|s|(sep)|dat|s|(sep)|voc|p|lang{{=}}la}}. My question is what the separator should be. It should be something that isn't legitimately used in existing entries and would not likely be used in future ones. If proposals are made, the current template can be modified to track any uses of those proposed tags in current entries, which would then allow us to assess the situation better. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:20, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

**Aren't quotations under the lemma form, not under the inflected form? —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 05:46, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
*** They can be, in languages like English that have little inflection. But for highly-inflected languages like Latin, they cannot. We want documentation of the various inflected forms, and many Latin verbs are incompletely conjugated, and some other Latin words have inflectional irregularities. It is not feasible to try to include supporting quotations for all forms of a Latin verb under the lemma; there are simply too many forms, and identifying and sorting the various forms within a lemma page would be disastrous for the sanity of both editors and users. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 23:40, 12 July 2015 (UTC) 
**** Angr is right, quotations and usage examples go on the lemma form. Quotations shouldn't be used merely to attest a term, they exist as a higher-quality alternative to usage examples. If the idea is to show attestation of a term, then it should go on the citation page, which exists for that purpose. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 13:55, 13 July 2015 (UTC)
***** No, Angr is wrong about this. We are not simply attesting the term and its usage as a collection of forms, but are cataloging spelling variation, different plural forms, and different inflected forms. While any of these ''can'' be listed at the lemma, it serves no useful purpose whatsoever to ''restrict'' them there. It is much more useful to be able to find supporting citations associated with the specific form of the word, rather than with a lemma form that, in some cases, has been chosen arbrtrarily from among the possible alternatives. If we are showing usage examples, as you say and as I agree, then those need to be placed on the forms pages too. If I want to see how the dative form of a word is used, I want to look at a collection of usages in the dative, not usage of all of the forms together. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 20:51, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
****** Then that certainly goes against the common practice among editors. Editors put usage examples for ''any'' of the inflected forms on the page of the lemma, and have done so since forever. They don't restrict themselves to putting only usage examples for the lemma form on that page. This practice is established enough that some editors will move the usage examples from a non-lemma page to the lemma. A change to this would certainly need further discussion.<br/>If you're looking for usage examples for the dative in a given language, you should not expect to find them in a dictionary under some random word. Explaining how cases are used is the job of a grammar, not a lexicon. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:07, 24 July 2015 (UTC)

****** As CodeCat and Angr have said: citations showing how a term is used go in the lemma entry. If in specific, unusual cases citations are needed to verify that the dative plural of a term is ''foobarenn'' rather than the usually-expected ''foobaren'' or whatever, then those citations go on the citations page. This has been the case for years. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:47, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
******* Argument from what "has been the case for years" (and I will not bother to argue whether this has actually ''been'' the situation or not) is a weak argument that does not address any objective Wiktionary is trying to accomplish. Further, your argument above makes sense only if (1) citations exist ''solely'' for the purpose of demonstrating grammatical usage, and (2) grammtical usage does ''not'' vary with form. But in some languages, the usage of a term may actually ''vary'' with the form of the inflection. As a simple example, the grammar of singular and plural {{l|la|millē}} are very differently in Latin. I would also argue that assuming point (1) is an unnecessary limitation on Wiktionary. Citations exist to document forms and spelling at least equal in measure to documenting proper grammar. To that end, each variant should ideally be (eventually) documented from sources. That cannot be reasonably accomplished if all the various citations are ''limited'' to the lemma page. And CodeCat, no one is suggesting we put the citations under a "random word"; that is a straw man argument. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 00:21, 25 July 2015 (UTC)

== the writing on the wall ==
We do not have an entry for any form of [[mene mene tekel upharsin]] (numbered, numbered, weighed, and divided). I think the language is Chaldean Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic) and it was probably written on the wall in Neo-Babylonian cuneiform script. Today, however, it is commonly used in English texts in Roman letters. Should there be an entry in Roman letters, and if so, what language to label it? I supposed it could be written in Hebrew ({{l|he|מְנֵ֥א מְנֵ֖א תְּקֵ֥ל וּפַרְסִֽין}}), Syriac, and/or cuneiform (if the spellings could be found in those scripts). [[User:Stephen G.

== Use "male" and "female" for gendered nouns ==

Many languages have nouns that occur in different forms depending on the natural gender of the referent, like French {{m|fr|comédien}}/{{m|fr|comédienne}}, English {{m|en|actor}}/{{m|en|actress}}. This is not actually grammatical gender the way we know it, exemplified by the fact that languages that have no grammatical gender can still often make such distinctions. Of course grammatical gender may align with natural gender in this case, but it doesn't have to (I can't think of an example, but maybe someone else can). Spanish {{m|es|amiga}} is not a grammatically feminine form of the lemma {{m|es|amigo}}; rather both are independent nouns and have different meanings. The choice is made based on the referent rather than based on grammatical rules.

So I think that using the terms "masculine" and "feminine" and using {{temp|feminine of}} and such for these cases is incorrect and confusing, as it conflates grammatical and natural gender. It's especially bizarre in entries like {{m|en|mayoress}} with languages that don't even have grammatical gender. I'm therefore proposing to introduce the separate terms "male" and "female" to refer to natural gender in these cases. {{m|es|amiga}} is the ''female equivalent'' or ''female counterpart'' of {{m|es|amigo}}, not a ''form''. There would need to be two new form-of templates. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:17, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

: If they are independent nouns then why do we need more templates at all? Define them separately, as e.g. "a man who mows lawns" and "a woman who mows lawns", and each can link to the other as a related term. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 20:20, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: That's not ideal, because they might have many distinct meanings. Duplicating them all would be bad. The idea of a new template is to indicate "this noun means the same as this other one, except referring to a female individual". —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:25, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:I don't agree. The Italian words {{m|it|gato}} and {{m|it|gata}} both mean {{m|en|cat}}. The '''animals''' are make and female, but the '''words''' are masculine and feminine. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 20:22, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: No, {{m|it|gato}} means male/unspecified cat, while {{m|it|gata}} means female cat. And, this is exactly my point. Grammatical gender is arbitrary. "Feminine of gato" tells us nothing; it merely indicates that this noun is related to "gato" but has feminine grammatical gender. Nothing in the entry indicates that the cat itself has to be female, only that the word referring to it is feminine. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:25, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
::: I can think of cases where grammatical gender doesn't match natural gender ({{m|ga|cailín||girl}} is masculine, while {{m|ga|gasóg||boy scout}} and {{m|ga|stail||stallion}} are feminine), but I can't think of a case where a word referring to a person of one gender is derived from a word referring to a person of the other gender, but grammatical and natural genders don't match (in a language that has grammatical gender, unlike English). —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 20:31, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
::: Oh, and if anyone's wondering why {{m|it|gato}} and {{m|it|gata}} are orange links, it's because the Italian words are actually {{m|it|gatto}} and {{m|it|gatta}}. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 20:32, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:::: {{m|it|gatta}}, as it is now, looks good. But as I said above, with highly polysemic words it becomes a problem to copy all the definitions. A simple template that refers to the definitions of the gender-neutral term is more effective. Also, this entry illustrates another important distinction between "feminine of" nouns and adjectives: the female equivalent noun can have meanings the male one doesn't have, or the reverse. With true grammatical gender, like that found in adjectives, that would be unthinkable. They really are separate nouns. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:36, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

:I'll write more later, but at the moment I just want to highlight that the observation that "the female equivalent noun can have meanings the male one doesn't have, or the reverse" calls into question the sensibility of avoiding spelling out which senses each word has and instead using a template that would "indicate 'this noun means the same as this other one, except referring to a female individual'".

:It may be wise to distinguish languages which have grammatical gender from those which do not. Because English does not normally* mark gender grammatically, it's at least debatable whether ''mayoress'' should be described as 'female' or 'feminine'. (The references turned up by {{b.g.c.|English "-ess" "feminine form"}}, compared to the irrelevance turned up by {{b.g.c.|English "-ess" "female form"}}, suggest that the traditional analysis has been that it's a 'feminine' rather than a 'female' form.) *Of course, note how {{b.g.c.|"blonde mayoress"}} gets two hits while "blond mayoress" gets none, and "blonde mayor" gets no hits while "blond mayor" gets at least five (plus a lot of chaff), suggesting that there ''are'' some areas where grammatical gender agreement is found in English.<br>In German and other languages with grammatical gender, the case for describing {{m|de|Wissenschaftlerin}} et al. as 'feminine' rather than 'female' forms of {{m|de|Wissenschaftler}} et al. is necessarily stronger, since they ''are'' feminine, and take feminine adjectives, etc, independent of whether or not they are regarded as 'feminine forms' or 'female forms' of the corresponding masculine nouns. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:26, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: One other thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the "female equivalent of X" means "woman is who is an X" but sometimes it means "wife of an X". In the UK at least, a {{m|en|duchess}} is always the wife or widow of a duke; no woman can become duchess by virtue of her birth. Our definition of {{m|de|Burggräfin}} is "female burgrave", but when burgraves were still running around they were always male; a {{m|de|Burggräfin}} is the wife of a burgrave. A hundred years ago or so, {{m|de|Professorin}} almost always meant "wife of a professor" but today it almost always means "female professor". In the {{w|E. F. Benson}} novel ''Trouble for Lucia'', a woman becomes mayor of a town in England and has to choose a {{m|en|mayoress}} to help her, but she is not the mayoress herself—in that context, then, ''mayoress'' means neither "female mayor" nor "wife of the mayor" but rather "woman who assists the mayor". I doubt a single template can or should accommodate all this variation. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 05:56, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
::: Those are excellent points. For words like those, I'm persuaded that we should give the words actual definitions (as Equinox said). For English, almost all of the ''-ess'' and ''-rix'' and other such entries I've seen do have definitions, and we should just clean up the few that don't. For German, the Duden has ''-in'' entries only as pointers to their masculine counterparts, but de.Wikt gives them full definitions, and entries like [[:de:wikt:Professorin]] (which records the different meanings) vs [//www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Professorin Duden: Professorin] (which doesn't acknowledge them) convince me that full definitions are preferable (and, I think, already the norm). That doesn't preclude the existence of entries that would be better handled by a template whose wording could then be debated, but we should probably identify some such entries before debating wording further.

* I agree with CodeCat that there is a problem with some entries: The current presentation at [[amiga#Spanish]] reads "feminine of amigo, friend", which seems suboptimal since it highlights grammatical properties rather than focusing on the referent. However, I don't agree with CodeCat's solution of using a template. Czech [[učitelka]] says "female teacher", which seems fine to me, and preferable to using a template. Above, Angr makes a good point about duchess: female duke vs. wife of a duke. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:23, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

== Language codes ==

2015-07.11 16:30
I'd like to add some language codes for some swedish "dialects" (they should be considered languages IMO) because I don't wanna clutter the swedish entries with tons of dialectal versions, not to mention the dialects have their own grammar and pronounciations and I would like it if I could list those.

The ones I have in mind are Pitemål (Peijtmåle), Lulemål (Leulmale), Överkalixmål (Överkölismale) and Jamtlandic (Jamska).

== Merging ( and ) into a single entry ==

I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to merge entries of separate brackets "[[(]]" and "[[)]]" into matched-pair entries such as "[[()]]" and leaving only single-character entries with definitions about actual uses of a single character without the other, when they exist; when they do not exist the single-character entries could redirect to the matched-pair entries.

Rationale:<br>
1. (repetition) The way it is now, most definitions are repeated: sometimes, the left side sense is "Begins X" and the right side sense is "Ends X". I don't think one should be required to check two separate pages to see definitions for the same thing; also, "begins" and "ends" makes it a bit longer to read, especially when these two words are present in almost all senses in the two pages.

2. (consistency) With two almost identical entries, editing one entry requires editing the other for consistency. I am in the process of updating [[(]] and [[)]] to conform with uses quoted in [[Citations:(]], but that makes it somewhat more cumbersome to keep both entries updated. One example of inconsistency (although easy to be fixed) is that {{unsupported|left curly bracket}} currently has a sense that {{unsupported|right curly bracket}} doesn't.

3. (lexical unit) I'd argue that since in most senses of () you can't use one without the other, they are together only one lexical unit. IMO, having them separated is like having the entry {{unsupported|full stop}} (full stop) with the sense "The first, second, or third dot in an [[ellipsis]], which indicates a pause or omission."

<small>(The reason 4 was added later the same day, 21:44, 12 July 2015 (UTC) - {{revision|33385406|original message linked here}}.)</small><br>
4. (incompleteness) '''[[“]]''' is defined as "Starts a quotation." and '''[[”]]''' is defined as "Ends a quotation." Like a number of other current single-character entries, this seems directed to readers who already know how to use the brackets or quotation marks. (Compare [[―]] (horizontal bar), defined as: "Introduces quoted text.", which from its definition seems exactly synonymous with [[“]] but does not actually require any mark at the end of the text.) If they are merged into [[“”]], then the definition is obviously going to change some way. But if they are kept as separate one-character entries, it would be more accurate to define them as:
: entry for left quotation mark ([[“]]) - "Starts a quotation that ends with ”."
: entry for right quotation mark ([[”]]) - "Ends a quotation that begins with “."

More examples of repeated definitions:<br>
[[(]] - Begins supplemental information.
: ''Sen. John McCain '''('''R., Arizona) spoke at length.''
[[)]] - Ends supplemental information.
: ''Sen. John McCain (R., Arizona''')''' spoke at length.''

Some affected entries:
* [[()]] = [[(]] + [[)]]
* [] [[Unsupported titles/Square brackets]] = [[Unsupported titles/Left square bracket]] + [[Unsupported titles/Right square bracket]]
* {} [[Unsupported titles/Curly brackets]] = [[Unsupported titles/Left curly bracket]] + [[Unsupported titles/Right curly bracket]]
* [[“”]] = [[“]][[”]]
* [[‘’]] = [[‘]][[’]]
* [[⟨⟩]] = [[⟨]][[⟩]]
* [[«»]] = [[«]][[»]]
* Other brackets: [[〔 ]][[〕]], [[「 ]][[」]], [[【 ]][[】]].
* Also possibly for Spanish: [[¿?]] = [[¿]][[?]]; [[¡!]] = [[¡]][[!]]

Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:45, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

* Yes, please. Though I would prefer a title of [[[[( ... )]]]] to avoid the impression that "()" appears in texts without anything in between, and because the ellipsis also lends itself well to phrases that are otherwise hard to lemmatise (e.g. {{m|en|I'm ... year(s) old}}). <span class="signature">— [[User:Kephir|Keφr]]</span> 09:49, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' [[’]], at least is not usually a paired character. [[”]] is also used as an unpaired character. Even when not used as apostrophes or transliteration characters, what pairs of quotes there are and what order they come in is language-dependent; to turn [[«]] and [[»]] into [[«»]], [[»«]] and [[»»]], as [[w:Guillemet]] says is necessary, is not a win.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 10:58, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
** I have never seen an unpaired use of [[”]]; I have seen [[″]], however.

*** And quotes, which come in various directions. Why not just a {{temp|paired with}} template instead of physically merging the pages.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 21:42, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

***** Because it's not as neat as [[a- -ing]]. Because quotes stand alone at the starts of lines to mark continued quotes in older books; because quotes are used in different pairs in different languages and different time periods. Because many quotes, whether or not you've seen them, have been used for non-quote purposes. The braces and parenthesis can probably justifiably be put together, at least I haven't seen an exception, but the quotes are much more complex across all writing then just simple standardized matched pairs.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 23:47, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
***** For example, [[“]] says "starts a quotation". That's incomplete; it also ends a quotation, as per [[w:Quotation mark]]. It can be matched up with several others.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 23:52, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
****** If we create entries for every combination in [[w:Quotation mark#Summary table for all languages]], then we would have these, as long as they are attestable: (using the format with space in the middle) [[“ ”]], [[„ “]], [[„ ”]], [[‘ ’]], [[‚ ’]], [[« »]], [[" "]], [[‹ ›]], [[» «]], [[› ‹]] and [[» »]]. I propose creating all the matched-pairs (11 entries don't look like too many, unless I'm missing something?) while leaving the single-characters with indexes to the matched-pairs. If we decide to do the opposite, e.g. keep only single-character entries and thus not create any of those matched-pairs, then the single characters would still need to have accurate indices of all formats of all language(s) either way. As an aside: [[「 」]] and [[『 』]] are fine to me, but I don't know exactly what to do with vertical brackets, I wonder if they could be treated as single-character exceptions until further discussion: [[﹃]] [[﹄]] and [[﹁]] [[﹂]]. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 00:28, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

:The merger seems like a good idea, as the matched-pair usage is, in a sense not SoP, but it is probably also true that we can find attestation of the use of each character in isolation and, just as in the case of the morphemes that make up a compound, we would probably want to keep separate entries, even if there were no attestation apart from the matched-pair use.
:We would in any event need to have hard redirects from the unmatched characters to the corresponding matched-pair entry. If we go the route of extensive hard (and soft) redirects, then the objection that no normal person would ever search for [[[[( ... )]]]] becomes moot. IOW as I see it each paired entry would need at least 3 hard or soft redirects to it and would not be useful without them.

* I'm adding now the 4th bullet point of the rationale in my first message above; please see it.

I am worried about [[']] and [["]]; spaceless matched-pair entries for these two would be [['']] and [[""]]; these look too ugly and [['']] (two apostrophes) looks identical to [["]] (one quotation mark) to me. I think the same with space ([[' ']] and [[" "]]) is great. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:44, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

In accordance with this proposal, or to test it a little to see if it looks good, I created 18 new entries for most of the variations of quotation marks listed in [[w:Quotation mark]]. I chose to link to and from all single-characters rather than using redirects. This improves our coverage since our entries didn't mention all these varieties before. Having separate entries is also an opportunity to explain better how they are used in each language. IMO, just having the entry [[”]] with "Ends a quotation." is worthless if we can write the quotation marks as many ways as '''[[“ ”]]''', '''[[” ”]]''' or '''[[„ ”]]'''.

See '''{{revision|33350344|this link}}''', it is very interesting. It is the previous version of the entry '''“''' with a translation table of 33 languages - just the ''starting'' quotation mark in each one, no mention of how to end the quotation, which I find confusing and annoying since you had to go to the other page to see how the quotation mark ends — sure enough, '''{{revision|25627574|this other link}}''' is '''”''' also with a translation table under the same circumstances, except with only 30 languages. If you saw the first table and discovered that Hungarian and Romanian apparently start quotations with '''„''' and Swedish starts them with '''”''', the second table won't help you to know how they end. Apparently this was intentional — since all these three seemingly end with '''”''', putting this information on the table would not be a "translation". Anyway, I deleted both tables and replaced them with one of my own. ({{temp|quotation marks}})

Also, {{user|Dan Polansky}} requested: "I request that pages [[(]] and [[)]] are left as they were at the start of this discussion for at least three days after the start of the discussion." While I did not touch the parentheses specifically yet, I've intentionally done as he said since the discussion started on July 12 and I edited the entries of quotation marks on July 16.

New entries:

* Curved double quotation marks: '''[[“ ”]]''', '''[[” ”]]''', '''[[„ ”]]''', '''[[„ “]]'''
* Curved single quotation marks: '''[[‘ ’]]''', '''[[’ ’]]''', '''[[‚ ’]]''', '''[[‚ ‘]]''', '''[[’ ‘]]'''
* Straight quotation marks: '''[[" "]]'''
* Apostrophes: '''[[' ']]'''
* Guillemets: '''[[« »]]''', '''[[» «]]''', '''[[» »]]'''
* Single guillemets: '''[[‹ ›]]''', '''[[› ‹]]'''
* Corner brackets: '''[[「 」]]''', '''[[『 』]]'''

Thoughts? Is it just me or do other people think they look good too? Do people think it was a waste of time and that the new entries should all be deleted? (I acknowledge some people here opposed the proposal, others supported it.)

I mostly just copied Wikipedia as I don't speak all those languages, and I used only minimal definitions for each entry. If there's any mistake in the entries or the table feel free to fix it, also expand the entries if you like. If it's alright, I'd like to do the same for [[( )]], square brackets, [[¿ ?]], etc. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:16, 16 July 2015 (UTC)

* '''Oppose''' proposed merge of [[(]] and [[)]] on the grounds that each is susceptible to unique senses.

# {{oppose}} Harder to type. Even if we have redirects from [[( )]] and [[()]] to [[( … )]], most people would try to type the entry name with ellipsis anyway before figuring out the redirects, since the name with ellipsis would be the actual entry name. Redirects would not be intuitive unless we start adding the {{temp|shortcut}} template to entries. I've created {{unsupported|square bracketed ellipsis}} as an example of entry which has the ellipsis as part of the entry name, not as an indication that it is a blank space to be filled. Having [ … ] simultaneously with that entry would require some additional explanation of what is a space to be filled and what is an actual ellipsis. Just like with the [[:Category:English circumfixes|English circumfixes]], I don't think the ellipsis is necessary to demonstrate that the space between parentheses is a blank to be filled, because: 1) in the case of parentheses and other common English symbols, most readers probably already know how they are positioned in relation to the text anyway; but 2) especially in the case of unknown and FL brackets, the definitions should explain this satisfactorily; even a simple phrase like "Encloses supplemental information." at [[( )]] is good enough IMO, especially when together with examples, and perhaps usage notes when needed. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 11:28, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

==FL example sentences==

There seems to be a great deal of inconsistency in the formatting of example sentences under foreign language entries. I've been reformatting them as I come across them, but it's a lot of work, and I'm not sure if there are any accepted formats besides the one given in the guidelines. Speaking of which:

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.''
#:: Here is an example.

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.''
#:: Here is an '''example'''.

Both of the above are considered correct according to WT:ELE, and both are common. Is one preferred over the other, or are both in equal use and equally allowed?

Now, here are some formats of FL examples that I've come across frequently for Spanish sentences (but with often missing punctuation included):

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' - Here is an example.
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' — “Here is an example.”
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' -- Here is an '''example'''.

There are others, but the above seem to be especially widespread (at least in Spanish entries), and at least some are being included in new definitions. Should I just leave them alone, or fix them as I see them? Is it possible to fix something like that with a bot?

I consider these numerous persistent extensions (in summa: 4 with [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary%3AVotes%2Fpl-2014-07%2FAllowing_well-attested_romanizations_of_Sanskrit&type=revision&diff=33283124&oldid=33282977 a fifth attempt] thwarted; I find the præsence of the adjective fair in this fifth attempt maladroit) of [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-07/Allowing_well-attested_romanizations_of_Sanskrit|a single vote]] truly inappropriate or at least disconcerting. I would like to clarify that currently this not a critical remark regarding the vote’s closing or outcome, instead I would like to discountenance said adjustment ''ad libitum'' of the expiration date of that already protracted vote with the aim to impede an outcome that at the time of the second extension (beginning of April) was an evident lack of consensus (7-6). Actually this had been mine initial motivation for participating in the vote: the desire to contribute with one more vote to the manifestness of the rejection and hopefully præcipitate the closure of that vote.<br />To me, there is no reasonable justification for extending any vote more that one month (to put it simply or to appeal to æsthetics: those numerous struck extensions encumber the mere lecture of the vote’s content), or at most one and a half months, but I would be interested to heed to others’ suggestions (if any arise) for a temporal limitation in that sense in order to præclude future unconfined extensions.

: If, instead of respecting the deadline, we repeatedly move it ahead until such time as we happen to have a sufficient number of voters to call it a consensus (which 12–6 isn't really, but let's ignore that arguendo), then we're favoring view of such latecomers as happen to come across the vote first, a [[w:selection bias|selection bias]]. If we believe that a longer time is necessary or desired, then (0) that longer time should be set when first proposing the vote and not extended. And if that realization comes post facto, then, ideally, (1) call it no consensus, discuss and advertise the issue better in the BP and perhaps elsewhere, and start a new and better vote, if desired. Or, at least, (2) we should have a limit of one extension on a vote. Or, at the very least, (3) we should extend a vote as long again after consensus is achieved as we did before it was (and as long again after it's achieved in the opposite direction, if that happens).

Voiding the vote now, after acquiescing to the multiple extensions by maintaining silence, would be unfair to those on the winning side of the decision. The best thing to do at this point would be to leave this vote as it stands, and to develop a policy that will address the extensions issue in future vote.

If we can't muster a quorum (6, 7, 8, 10?; counting abstainers?; differing for various classes of votes (bot status, admin votes, substantive?), then there should be no mandatory policy resulting from the vote. Votes probably need to be more publicized. The subpage structure interferes with achieving comprehensive coverage of votes. Would Editor news be good for that or BP?

You're right that the vote has been called. Arguably, it's been called inappropriately. Can't people contest the closure on the vote page and see if consensus builds there to let it stand closed or not, without holding a new vote on the issue, and with the burden on those who wish to reopen it (viz so that, if no consensus builds at all, the vote stays closed)?

You cannot on any vote just wait until 2/3 supermajority happens; most votes do not create that opportunity. In any vote in which waiting until 2/3 worked, there was in fact a lot more support than opposition. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:03, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

== Deletion of good faith edits with no explanation ==

I have been a very sporadic contributor to Wiktionary for a number of years. Sometimes I have little bursts of activity, and then sometimes long gaps of inactivity. One of the things that repeatedly drives me away just when I might be getting enthusiastic about joining the project is the unexplained deletion of added content, such as happened [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=marigold&diff=33413519&oldid=33412790 here]. This comes across as extremely rude and hostile. I understand that a lot of vandalism and nonsense has to be reverted, and I understand that mistakes are sometimes made. However, this has happened to me too often, and mostly (as far as I recall) from certain editors, for it to always be a mistake. I think instead it is a cultural problem here amongst certain members that the community would do well to address. [[Special:Contributions/109.153.244.21|109.153.244.21]] 20:56, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

== Italicizing the entry name of taxonomic names ==

I am just announcing an edit I made, since I was thinking about it for a while and decided to just do it today without discussing beforehand.

I made {{temp|taxoninfl}} italicise the entry title of all entries for taxonomic names that use this template, so that:

* [[Acer rubrum]]'s title is ''Acer rubrum''
* [[Gorilla gorilla]]'s title is ''Gorilla gorilla''
* etc.

:: Sorry about that. Based on your comment, I've changed the template further to italicize the entry name only when <code>i=1</code>, just like the headword line. That way, ''[[Homo]]'' is italicized while [[Hominidae]] isn't. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:29, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

:::And that conflicts with the German use of [[Homo]]. Maybe I should just undo the change and leave all the affected entries without italics like they were?

::::There's no good reason to have a pl parameter. All taxa are proper nouns. At rank of genus or lower they have the form of a singular Latin noun. At ranks higher than genus they have the form of a plural Latin noun. That is more or less part of the prescribed "grammar" of such names. Plural forms of generic and subgeneric rank taxa are not, strictly speaking part of the taxonomic name system. One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded. It would be interesting to see whether they appeared in New Latin genus and species descriptions, but arguably they would then be Latin.

One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded." In the past, before I started editing [[Homo sapiens]] and [[Homines sapientes]] for a number of different reasons, there were English sections, an (odd) translation table and pronunciations; I moved all the applicable information into Translingual. Personally, I'd rather keep them that way, even if other entries for declensions of homo+sapiens are attestable ([[Hominis sapientis]]? [[Homini sapienti]]?), especially if those are found in running text in multiple languages. But it would be understandable if you and/or other people wanted to use different language sections for those like we do for CJK languages. You said the plurals are not strictly part of the system, for this reason I apologize since the current format with pl= makes it seem like the plurals really are part of the system. I propose keeping the plurals Translingual, at least until further discussion, while linking from the singular forms as Derived terms or the like, if you'd agree with that. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 20:18, 17 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::{{reply to|Daniel Carrero}} Why bother for two instances? I would have thought that {{temp|mul-proper noun}} (which is not deprecated, just not my preference for taxonomic names) was perfect for that. Furthermore it is difficult for me to accept that plural and genitive forms ''are'' taxonomic names. The citations indicate that the terms are being used as plural for members of the group ''Homo spaiens'', not for plurals of the group. Every taxonomic name is of a group, not of its members. One great advantage of limiting the use of {{temp|taxoninfl}} to taxonomic names is that it can be used to identify taxonomic entries that are lemmas. Remember that the heterogeneity of Translingual makes the idea of a single class of Translingual lemmas useless for most practical purposes.

::::::::{{reply to|DCDuring}} You are most involved with entries for taxonomic names and I edit them only occasionally. I have the feeling I'm probably going to [[fold]] and revert quick if you say I've done something wrong with the templates or the entries. Still, there's a point I would like to discuss. About: "Every taxonomic name is of a group, not of its members." as well as "Plural forms of generic and subgeneric rank taxa are not, strictly speaking part of the taxonomic name system. One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded." Wiktionary is a descriptive dictionary. Even if taxonomic names are intended to be used as proper nouns representing entire groups, while this should be respected and informed in the entries, I'd argue that their separate usage as nouns is nothing special. Just like you can say: "I've found a member of ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''!", you could say "I've found a ''Vulpes vulpes''!" and find plenty of citations of "noun" versions of taxonomic names like this in multiple languages. IMO, cited uses like this don't constitute a reason for having separate sections other than Translingual for any languages, let alone a great number of language sections just for cited noun senses for a given entry as they are found, especially if any plurals attested use the rules of Latin grammar in multiple languages. I'm not sure if we could have Translingual noun senses along with proper noun senses, or maybe not? My point is just that it does not seem to merit separate language sections just for this. What do you think? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 01:17, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::I don't think that the way people use them is the same in every language and I have no idea how to get that information. I'm not even going to do it in English. What authoritative resource would we use for that? It I can't imagine doing the attestation. I'm not going to beat my brains out to incorporate relatively subtle variations which most users won't even notice. Our dictionary is rife with omission of much less subtle information in areas that are know to cause English language learners problems: ambiguous, erroneous, and misleading use of determiners in our definitions and failure to provide basic grammatical information ((un)countability), (in)transitivity, complements) come to mind. 
:::::::::In any event we would have to document the usage of taxonomic names in the communities that use them most. A very small share of taxonomic names even have vernacular-language homonyms that correspond to the taxa and we have entries for some of those, especially in horticulture, eg. [[azalea]], [[andromeda]], [[rhododendron]]. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  02:02, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::Daniel is right, though: while the authorities may prescribe that the names be used only for "the group X", many of them are well attested in multiple languages as terms for "a member of the group X", which can be used with the indefinite article and in the plural (see e.g. [[Citations:Homo sapiens]], and {{b.g.c.|"un Homo sapiens"}}). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 03:37, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::I would think it more useful to have note on how folks borrow taxonomic terms into each language in general than to lexicalize a million or even a hundred instances of such borrowing. 
:::::::::::All someone has to do is attest the pattern of usage (capitalization, pluralization, and other inflections in some languages) for each language in which the Translingual term is borrowed and used. I don't see any way around it. Today I looked at plurals of ''Virus''. In some germanic languages the plural is ''Virusen''. I don't think that belongs in Translingual as it reflects a pattern specific to at most a group of languages.
:::::::::::I certainly won't protest if someone chooses to do all of that, but I am more interested in having Translingual entries for purposes of disambiguating vernacular names; helping folks read scientific literature by providing etymology, pictures, and translations; and even providing gender to help folks with naming species. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  04:03, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::A language-specific plural is evidence that the Latin/Translingual term has been borrowed into another language. (Jumi Vogler, ''Was der Humor für Sie tun kann, wenn in Ihrem Leben mal ...'', 2014, page 20, has this example of {{m|de|Eindeutschung}}: Zumal damals das Warenangebot an '''Homo sapiensen''' noch relativ klein war.) If a Latinate plural, however, is used in as many languages as a Latinate singular, I don't see how only one of them could be excluded from the Translingual section short of saying "we copy what the authorities prescribe on this matter", which doesn't comport with descriptivism. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Homo_sapiens&type=revision&diff=33584730&oldid=33558223 Here]'s one way such information could be presented (note not only my added sense and usage note, but the plural which is already provided). If one wanted to weigh the scales a bit in favour of prescriptivism, one could even confine both things to the usage note, i.e. not add a second sense-line nor a plural to the headword-line, but mention both in the usage note. <br>I suppose if the 2 or 3 entries which currently have plurals are the only ones that pluralize and/or are used with the indefinite article to refer to members of a group / species / etc, and they only do so in 5 or 6 languages, one could argue it's easier to add 18 different language sections than to expand 3 Translingual sections... but if more entries than that pluralize, it becomes untenable, IMO, to require a myriad of different language sections rather than expand the Translingual section.

:I won't invoke our slogan. Wikispecies generally does not bother with obsolete taxa or with the gender and etymology of any taxa. (Few other taxonomic databases bother with gender and etymology either.) They also do not always have entries that correspond to well-attested vernacular names including those we already have, which is the purpose of the lists at [[User:DCDuring/MissingTaxa]]. Wikipedia doesn't bother with gender and is very uneven about covering etymology and obsolete taxa. 
:That we don't provide pronunciations or translations of taxa is a result of our decisions, not whether such would be useful to users. Our decision about translations is apparently based on the perceived need to reflect how native speakers of various languages actually pronounce the taxon, not how it ''ought'' to be pronounced, though that is what users seem to want. Our decision not to have translations seems as much to be that a vernacular name could be viewed as a monolingual synonym, as a translation, or as a term identifying members of the group named by the taxon, so we didn't want to depart from the gem-like precision of our conceptual model of language to include them.

:: Some comments about the utility and challenges of Wikispecies:
::# For a long time, a single sysop ran the entire operation his way, 24/7, overruling anyone else making edits there. A lot of animosity developed between this sysop, other sysops, and some other wiki projects. That user has since been banned, but this also means that style and content are a bit unstable as the community finds its footing again.
::# Wikispecies goes in heavy for sourcing the publication, description, revision, and circumscription of taxa. This often has no bearing on the use of the word, but is of vital importance to researchers.
::# Wikispecies has a highly navigable taxonomic tree built into every entry, such that taxonomic changes can be easily implemented without having to re-edit every affected entry.
::# Commons links to Wikispecies whenever there is an entry to match a Commons category. Some Wikipedias (such as fr) also build in a link to Wikispecies from their taxoboxes. This isn't universal, though, in either direction, in part because the classification systems in use at different Wikipedias does not always match.
::# Further, since Wikidata now controls interwiki links between the Wikipedias, the link situation has deteriorated. The editing of interwiki links between botanical taxa, for example, is under the control and supervision of User:Brya, who has been banned here, at the English Wikipedia, and at the Dutch Wiktionary and Wikipedia, for contentious edits, sockpuppetry, and a number of other problems. Her idiosyncratic ideas have led to a fragmentation of data items on Wikidata so that identical circumscriptions of taxa given different names, attributions, or rank on different Wikipedias are no longer interlinked. And links will only exist if ''everything'' about the taxa match ''exactly'' (and even then I've come across baffling counterexmaples).
:: So, we're a long way from useful interlinking between taxon entries on different projects. It is therefore difficult to avoid or streamline any duplication of content or redundancy of data. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 21:11, 24 July 2015 (UTC)

== Normalization of entries 2 ==

[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries]] failed. See also at the end of the vote [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries#Decision|my comments]] about the result of the vote, which I'm cool with, since the affected policy is still imperfect. The vote proposed having [[Wiktionary:Normalization of entries]] ([[WT:NORM]]) as an official policy alongside [[WT:CFI]] and [[WT:ELE]]. [[WT:NORM]] deals with aspects of formatting that are invisible to the user but are expected to be standardized nonetheless, such as whitespaces, spaces between == ==, the placement of interwikis at the end of the page and the placement of categories at the end of the language section.

The list of items currently in the policy was developed from [[User talk:Connel MacKenzie/Normalization of articles|this extensive 2006 thread]], which shaped the wiki code of our entries as we know to this date with the major role of [[User:AutoFormat]] (2007–2010) and I proposed to be officialized through [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Voting on normalization of entries|this discussion from May 2015 with 13 polls]]. Controversial, outdated or undiscussed items were removed from the list and moved to [[Wiktionary talk:Normalization of entries#Removed items|here]]. Continuing from where the previous discussion left off, I thought of 2 more polls to address issues that were raised in the vote. I feel it's a good idea to keep asking questions until the policy is just right. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]])

----

===Poll 14===
<s>Proposal:<br>
Having [[WT:NORM]] only with rules that affect the wiki code of the entry and are invisible to the readers.<br>
Rationale:<br>
Currently, most rules listed in [[WT:NORM]] are invisible, (such as whitespace, line breaks, spaces between == ==, spaces after * and interwikis at the end of the list), so it does not matter if the rules are followed or not by editors, the page would look the same to readers. If there are any rules that affect the layout of the pages, they should be kept in [[WT:ELE]], not [[WT:NORM]]. Use the comments of this poll to discuss exactly rules can be affected by this poll.</s>

'''Comments'''
<!-- Enter comments here. -->
<br>I believe the rules that exist in the current version of [[WT:NORM]] and can be removed for affecting the layout of the entries are, specifically:
* Language names should not be linked
* Translation sections: Markup such as gender should be provided within the {{temp|t}}/{{temp|t+}} template, except for qualifiers, which should use {{temp|qualifier}}
* ---- before each language heading except the first
--[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:04, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
* Hi Daniel. I'm unclear as to what you mean exactly by "invisible to the reader". Can you spell out which rules aren't invisible? As I mentioned, I had two objections. One concerns the insistence that categories need to be put at the end of the language section instead of at the end of an etymology subsection; I assume this is "invisible to the reader"? The other is about only one headword line per section, which simply doesn't work well for some Arabic entries. I assume this is "visible to the reader"? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:14, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
*: Hi Benwing. After you sent this message, since no one besides myself had voted for this poll yet, I've changed the whole text of the poll; maybe it does look clearer now? 
*:After you gave your reasons for opposing both rules of "only one headword line per section" and "categories need to be put at the end of the language section", I simply removed them from [[WT:NORM]] and added them to [[Wiktionary_talk:Normalization_of_entries#Removed_items]] until further discussion. But, since following these rules does affect how the entry look like to readers, I'd say these are "visible" rules and thus I don't think they should be applicable in [[WT:NORM]] anyway. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:35, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
*::I'm striking this poll. I edited [[WT:NORM]] so that all rules of this policy concern whitespace, blank lines, etc. and removed everything else that changes the layout of the entry, thus is "visible" to the reader of the entry.

Rather than having support/oppose/abstain options, I would like to discuss what looks better in each case.

Personally, my opinions are:
* Yes - I believe it's especially important that we do insert a blank line between the image and a new section that follows below the image (===Noun===, for example), because if there were no image, a blank line would precede the new section anyway.
* No - don't insert a blank line between the image and a headword template. (in cases where the image is between ===Noun=== and {{temp|en-noun}}, for example, just don't insert a blank line anywhere) That because, in my mind, the headword template is sort of the extension of the POS heading.
* In all other cases, I'd probably be fine either way, but I'm leaning towards: yes, have the space in all situations, it looks better and a bit easier to read, by properly separating one type of content from the other.
Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 12:53, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

** {{ping|DCDuring}} No, not that I'm aware of.

In addition, the [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Poll 6|poll 6]] from May 2015 was specifically about having a image or a {{temp|wikipedia}} box between two headings. In that poll, I addressed a similar question about spaces changing the appearance of the page. My reply was: "[E]xtra vertical space only appears if we use a broken template with extra newlines at the end of the code before <nowiki><includeonly/></nowiki>, I presume? [...]" and I mentioned [[five second rule]] and [[feminism]] as two entries which use images with spacing without breaking anything. Also, the results of the poll I mentioned were 0-6-0-2, meaning 6 votes supporting the spacing, no votes supporting the space-less version; no opposes and 2 abstains. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 19:42, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

== Uncommon and exotic words in Translations section ==

Someone added German ''Weltnetz'' and ''Zwischennetz'' to the "Translations" section of [[Internet]]: see {{diff|33582517}}.
These words are hardly used, and the usual German word for ''Internet'' is simply ''Internet''.
The presence of these words in the "Translations" section suggests that they are normal German translations of the English term ''Internet''.

What should one do with them?
* Delete them? As English to German translations they are useless and misleading.
* Add labels? Such as ''hardly used''?

[[Wiktionary:Translations]] doesn't say much about this problem.

== ISBN - request for more opinions ==

There is a discussion at [[Wiktionary talk:About Czech#Rejzek 2015]] whether an ISBN parameter can stay in the reference template {{template|R:Rejzek 2015}} or whether it should be removed. After several reverts were made at the template I would like to ask the community for more opinions to decide the issue. Thanks. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 17:28, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
: My reasoning, for a Beer parlour discussion: ISBN is visual noise, and makes the user experience worse for people like me. It is inessential for identification. It is inessential for search purposes. It is not used in the references sections of multiple English books that I own and that I checked. I prefer that the use of ISBN in reference templates is avoided. I also prefer that it is avoided in attesting quotations, but that is less urgent since these are hidden in the mainspace by default. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 18:53, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
: What we could do is create an appendix with references. The reference template would link to a location in the appendix, like Appendix:References#Rejzek_2015. That location would provide more extensive information, including the ISBN, and maybe multiple relevant searches, and links related to the reference, including one to Wikipedia. Book identifiers other than ISBN could be provided as well, if wished. Thus, we could keep the appearance of the reference template in the mainspace short and simple, while providing extensive detail to those readers who need or want it. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:22, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

Or, arguably the link should be from the page number (as DCD suggested above); but we often link to bgc from the page number (directly to the right page, which special:booksources does not).

:::ISBN is only for most books published since 1970 (1967 with some conversion adjustments). It is not the same as EAN, though it can be converted to EAN. It is most relevant for those who would purchase a book, as libraries don't always make it easy to find book from its ISBN. 
:::The ISBN is overly specific in that it specifies particular stock-keeping units for book retailers, not specific texts, which may be available in multiple ISBNs. 
:::It is the display of "ISBN" followed by the ISBN number that is my core problem. Can we not have less clutter while achieving the same link as a result? 
:::I would much prefer that we standardize on the display of desired links, of which I can think only of two at the moment. The more desirable of the two is a link to a particular page of the reference work (or database) available online. The second is the special:booksources link.

So can we really take a vote seriously if everyone is just voting for preference without substantiating anything? For political voting that works, but not for a community based on consensus. We have no coalition and opposition here, nor should we.

And he suggests changing the customary threshold for passage or disqualifying "oppose" votes so that the vote could still pass without consensus. Hmm... can you see why people are suspicious of the legitimacy of the vote? In the past (for years, ''vide'' [[Wiktionary:Votes/Timeline]]), when a vote showed that there was no consensus for something, the vote was closed at the scheduled time as "no consensus" (or simply as "fails", because votes require consensus to pass).

Thus, the "clearly widespread use" condition of Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion (CFI) is considered to be met by any sign that is used by multiple independent deaf communities, and the "usage in permanently recorded media" condition includes any visual media that has been widely distributed, including DVDs, broadcast television, and sign language dictionaries.' I have not been active on Wiktionary for some time, so I might be out of date, but I would not be in favor of adding sign languages to the LDL. 
:: As to Angr's point about natural languages, the CFI page includes a link to [[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Well_documented_languages]] which specifically notes that only approved constructed languages are acceptable. 
:: A very picky follow-up WRT to Angr's point. The number of citations requirement says: "For languages well documented on the Internet, three citations in which a term is used is the minimum number for inclusion in Wiktionary. For terms in extinct languages, one use in a contemporaneous source is the minimum, or one mention is adequate subject to the below requirements. For all other spoken languages that are living, only one use or mention is adequate, subject to the following requirements:" Somebody might argue that a spoken, living constructed language that is not in the list of "languages well documented on the Internet" therefore requires only one use or mention.

This change would affect all wikis, so if you support/oppose or want to give general feedback/concerns, please post them to the [[w:c:Commons:Village_pump/Proposals#Create_PNG_thumbnails_of_static_GIF_images|proposal page]].

== {{tl|huh}} ==

I created {{tl|huh}} [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=small_hours&diff=prev&oldid=33603844 here] because {{tl|cleanup}} would not adequately explain the problem; the way wikipedia uses {{tl|huh}} would have explained what I wanted to convey.  I suggest making a template similar to the way it is used on Wikipedia.[[Special:Contributions/68.148.186.93|68.148.186.93]] 00:12, 25 July 2015 (UTC)

==Transliteration of Ξ==
:''split off from an old general discussion of transliteration at'' '''[[Wiktionary:Grease pit/2014/June#Automatic transcription appears to override manual transcription?]]'''

{{ping|LlywelynII}} has pointed out that Wiktionary's idiosyncratic automatic transliteration of [[Ξ]] as ''ks'' should be changed to ''x''; I support this, as it is how every other authority I can find on Greek transliterates the character (viz {{w|ELOT}}, {{w|United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names|UN}}, {{w|ISO 843}}, {{w|ALA-LC romanization|ALA-LC}}, {{w|BGN/PCGN}}). It is also how other etymological dictionaries transliterate the character (look at the etymology of ''climax'' in Merriam-Webster, Dictionary.com, Collins, and OxfordDictionaries). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 17:56, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

: {{reply to|-sche}} Yes, I'd '''support''' this change, too. — [[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 18:30, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
: My preference is for ''ks'', because we also transliterate ''ps''. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:39, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
:: I don't take your point. ⟨ps⟩ is the [[w:Romanization of Greek|''standard'' transliteration]] and always has been. ⟨ks⟩ isn't and never has been. It's not even useful since ⟨x⟩ simply is a /ks/ sound; indeed, it's actively misleading since ⟨κσ⟩ is actually ⟨ks⟩. 

:: Now, I'm fully on board keeping ⟨χ⟩ as ⟨kh⟩ because it has nothing to do with English's /t͡ʃ/ noise and even support treating ⟨φ⟩ differently once other scholars do as well. But it's not a biggie either way. We can quickly link to a full Greek entry and the Greek pronunciation template does a good job presenting the changing pronunciations over time.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 23:00, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
: If there hadn't been any standards, I would have preferred ''ks''. Now we just have to decide between being less confusing or following the standards. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:43, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
::Why? English has a letter for the sound /ks/ and it's ⟨x⟩. What do you think is confusing about it? The transliteration is into English, not IPA. Further, how do you feel that it isn't confusing to use an idiosyncratic standard which conflates ⟨ξ⟩ and ⟨κσ⟩?&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 23:00, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
:::: Because transliterations don't only go by English. For example, we use ''x'' to transliterate Russian /x/ and Persian /χ/. Not to mention that it looks too much like the Greek ''χ''. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 13:32, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
::: For the same reason it's not confusing to conflate ψ and πσ. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:55, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

:Obviously, I '''support''' the change, even though it is somewhat off-topic to talk about romanization schemes for modern Greek (ELOT & al.) when dealing with ancient Greek. (All the romanization schemes for ancient Greek ''also'' use ⟨x⟩, though, so it's no biggie.)

:I'll take the opportunity, though, to note that once you saw every single transliteration scheme backed me up there was absolutely nothing helpful in maintaining broken transliterations by repeatedly reverting my proper corrections. If Wiktionary doesn't have a {{smallcaps|[[:s:WP:IAR|wp:iar]]}} analogue, you need one. We're here to improve the entries, not just make ourselves feel big by screwing with people and maintaining errors on procedural grounds.

:: Yes, we're here to improve the entries, but reasonable people can disagree about how to achieve that, and reasonable people can do things for other reasons than to "make ourselves feel big by screwing with people". There's a difference between argumentation and argumentativeness, between logic and ad hominem. Please try to stay on the right side of it. You're very sure you're right, and you want everyone to let you do things your own way, but then, the same could be said of [[User talk:Nemzag#DI‑GAMMA / VAU : Smooth‑breathing & SIGMA / SAN : Rough‑breathing|this guy]]. He would have said it was all about improving the entries, too.
:: Now, to the merits: there are reasons for the current transliteration scheme that have nothing to do with anyone being dropped on their head when they were little. [[X]] is open to confusion: not only does it look like [[χ]], but it's been used to represent it, for instance in {{w|beta code}}. There's no doubt about what "ks" represents. It's also a matter of being consistent in using digraphs for both the consonant + s series and the aspirated consonant series. Your way has merit, but it's not the only way that makes sense.

:: {{ping|LlywelynII}} please note that it took a single edit to change not just the entry you were screaming bloody murder over, but every single entry that uses a template to link to any Ancient Greek word with that letter in it anywhere on Wiktionary, and every link using the templates that will ever be added to Wiktionary as long as the module is in its current state.

* One should not be confused about the status quo ante at [[Module:grc-translit]], which was created on 8 September 2013 by [[User:ZxxZxxZ]]. The decisive thing should be the status quo in the manually entered transliterations that were used in Ancient Greek entries before the module was created. I recall [[User:Atelaes]] had some cards in Ancient Greek transliteration.

== Derivation categories for multiple homonymous morphemes ==

Many languages have morphemes that are spelled and/or pronounced the same, but have different origins and different uses. An example is the English {{m|en|-er}}: it has a variety of unrelated uses. Currently, {{temp|suffix}}, {{temp|affix}} and family would put words in the same category even if they are derived from different underlying suffixes. Consequently, the categories are a bit of a mess, just see [[:Category:English words suffixed with -er]]. The same is now also happening with PIE root categories; some roots are actually two distinct but homonymic roots, and it's necessary to distinguish which of them a word came from. I think this should be fixed somehow, but I'm not sure in what way. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:24, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
: Perhaps we could put a disambiguation suffix on the category names so that different homonyms go to different categories (maybe <nowiki>[[Category:English words suffixed with -er/2]] or [[Category:English words suffixed with -er:2]]</nowiki>?). That would require adding a parameter to the affix templates to specify the disambiguator. It would also require adding the same parameter to the catboilers so they could accommodate the suffixes. The catboilers would need to add the unsuffixed category so the suffixed categories would show up as subcategories in the unsuffixed categories. It would also be a good idea to add a parameter for a sense ID or similar anchor to the catboilers so that they could add the anchor to the url in the same way that catfix adds the language tag. It might make it easier if the anchor and the parameters/suffixes were all the same.
: The difficult part would be keeping the unsuffixed category empty: I don't really see a way to inform people who add the affix templates to etymologies about whether the morpheme they're adding has suffixed categories- they would have to check. I suppose you could have the catboilers check for both suffixed subcategories and entries being present at the same time, and adding the unsuffixed categories to a maintenance category. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 01:51, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I was thinking of numbers as well at first, but you mentioned senseid. If we're going to be using senseid (which we should) then why not use the senseid itself as the disambiguator? We'd have something like [[:Category:English words suffixed with -er (agent noun)]], and the page {{m|en|-er}} itself would have {{temp|senseid|en|agent noun}}.
:: This does bring up a shortcoming of senseid though. It's designed and intended for tagging individual senses. But what if we want to tag whole etymologies or parts of speech? Do we need a new template, or should we just continue using the existing senseid? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:37, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
: How about using the part of speech in the category name? English nouns suffixed with -xyz? This would require a pos= parameter in the template call, though. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 13:09, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
:: That's not going to work if many have the same part of speech. Part of speech is not enough to uniquely separate them. Consider for example {{m|en|bystander}} versus {{m|en|bylaw}}. Moreover, it doesn't work at all with the PIE root categories or any other case where POS is not relevant. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 13:33, 2 August 2015 (UTC)

== Category:(langname) plurals and Category:(langname) noun plural forms ==

:''Continuing the discussion from [[Module talk:category tree/poscatboiler/data/non-lemma forms#Plurals and noun plural forms|Module talk:category tree/poscatboiler/data/non-lemma forms § Plurals and noun plural forms]]''
Right now both Category:(langname) plurals and Category:(langname) noun plural forms exist, their descriptions are the same "(langname) nouns that are inflected to be quantified as more than one (more than two in some languages with dual number)." And they are used in mostly the same way. The main difference is that there are counterparts to Category:(langname) noun plural forms, such as Category:(langname) noun dual forms, which don't exist for Category:(langname) plurals. And this also follows with the naming scheme of (langname) adjective * forms.

I think we should either change plurals to be more general ((langname) terms that are... (vs (langname) nouns that are...)) and move it out of noun forms, or better yet just remove it. Note that (langname) singularia/dualia/pluralia tantum categories exist. [[User:Enoshd|Enosh]] ([[User talk:Enoshd|talk]]) 18:56, 2 August 2015 (UTC)

:: I thought the goal was to merge any plural category into their appropriate forms category. For example [[:Category:Hungarian plurals]] were merged into [[:Category:Hungarian noun forms]] a long time ago. So there is no separate category for plurals at this moment. Isn't the goal the same for all languages?

: ''Finally'' done for English. That was a lot of work for sure. A lot of entries needed manual fixing too so it wasn't just a simple bot run. In many entries, the plural-of definition was mixed in with other "proper" lemma definitions even though these should be kept to separate noun sections. There were also many entries where the headword line specified a noun lemma, rather than a noun plural form. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:24, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

== Thai transliterations with tones ==
{{movedfrom|Wiktionary:Grease pit/2015/August#Thai transliterations with tones}}

Native speakers seem to dislike dictionary and textbook transliterations designed for learners, which includes tones and replace it with {{w|Royal Thai General System of Transcription}} (RTGS). I see my older edits replace toned transliterations with RTGS.

I think it's a problem. The standard Thai transliteration system (RTGS) lacks not just tones but displays short and long vowels the same way, merges some consonants. I think it can be used as one of the systems but not the main one. I mentioned this in [[User_talk:Iudexvivorum#Fixes_to_.E0.B9.80.E0.B8.A8.E0.B8.A3.E0.B8.A9.E0.B8.90.E0.B8.A2.E0.B8.B2.E0.B8.98.E0.B8.B4.E0.B8.9B.E0.B9.84.E0.B8.95.E0.B8.A2|this discussion]].

I insist that transliterating Thai tones is very important, not just the nominal but irregular tones as well. We could include RTGS along with phonetic transliterations (another parameter in Thai headwords?).

For example, {{l|th|ฉัน}} is nominally "chăn" but normally pronounced "chán" (pronoun), also {{l|th|ไหม}} (sense 1) is pronounced "mái" (nominally "măi"). I suggest we should use '''toned''' transliterations, as dictionaries and textbooks do, not as prescribed by the Thai government. {{ping|Stephen G. Brown|Iudexvivorum|Iyouwetheyhesheit}}. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 12:17, 3 August 2015 (UTC)

# I agree that we need a romanisation system that better reflects tones, short and long vowels, etc.
# What system should we use then?
# The system developed by Thai2english (T2E) might be okay. But the [http://www.thai2english.com/ T2E machine transliterator] should be used with caution, as it sometimes gives incorrect transliterations (see the table below).
# Some other systems that might work:
## The now-defunct 1939 version of the RTGS ([http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1941/JSS_033_1d_RoyalInstituteTranscriptionOfThaiIntoRomanCharacters.pdf English translation]) contains a general system and a precise system (which records tones, short and long vowels, etc.).
## The [http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf ALA-LC system] is generally used by libraries in English-speaking countries. But this system lacks tone marks. (Could we add tone marks ourselves?)
## {{w|ISO 11940}} is used in academic context.

:I completely agree that transliterations need to reflect long vowels and tone marks. If I'm trying to learn Thai, it will do me no good to have important phonetic information like this left out. Native speakers should not be the ones determining transliteration; translit is not designed for them. However, I think that this T2E system looks just awful, and I don't think it will help. People expect foreign words to follow the usage where a e i o u stand for the sounds they have in Latin and Spanish, rather than using weird things like ''ay'' for /e/, ''oo'' for /u/, ''or'' for (presumably) /ɔ/ (this latter notation is especially unhelpful for American English speakers), etc. ISO 11940 won't work either because it's a translit system in the narrow sense in that it reflects the writing rather than the pronunciation (properly speaking, Wiktionary misuses "transliteration" to mean "transcription" but that is a discussion for another day). Adding the tone marks to the ALA-LC system is not a bad idea; you could imagine taking the T2E tone marks and adding them to the ALA-LC system. You could also imagine rewriting long vowels as e.g. ''aa'' instead of ''ā'', to avoid the stacking up of diacritics when long vowels are combined with tone marks.

:{{ping|Iudexvivorum}} Thanks. Good job! I was going to suggest the system used by Benjawan Poomsan Becker. In his dictionaries he uses special characters for vowels "ʉ" for {{lang|th|อึ}}, "ɛ" for {{lang|th|แอะ}}, "ɔ" for {{lang|th|เอาะ}} and "ə" for {{lang|th|เออะ}}. Long vowels are simply duplicated, e.g. {{l|th|ตืน}} is "dtʉʉn". Tone marks are used on the first vowels only, e.g. {{l|th|เบิก}} is "bə̀ək". Tone marks are (using "a"): "a" (1 - no tone mark), "à" (2), "â" (3), "á" (4) and "ǎ" (5). Like T2E he uses d-dt-t, b-bp-p.
:Using that system the examples above become:
:* ไม้ใหม่ไหม้มั้ย: máai mài mâi mái
:* กรุงเทพมหานคร อมรรัตนโกสินทร์: grung-têep-má-haa-ná-kon a-mon-rát-dtà-ná-goh-sǐn

:I agree that Thai2English may not transliterate words correctly, which it doesn't have in their dictionary. (I wonder if [[อธิกมาส]] has various readings, though. Both T2E and http://www.thai-language.com transliterate it as "atíkmâat".). Are "a-tí-gà-mâat" and "a-tík-gà-mâat" irregular alternative readings? --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 12:32, 4 August 2015 (UTC)

:{{ping|Atitarev}}:
:# The term [[อธิกมาส]] is never pronounced "a-thik-mat" (a-tík-mâat). Grammatically, it is pronounced "a-thi-ka-mat" (a-tí-gà-mâat), as it is from Sanskrit [[अधिकमास]] ''adhikamāsa''. But people also pronounce it as "a-thik-ka-mat" (a-tík-gà-mâat) and this pronunciation has become so popular. The {{w|Royal Institute Dictionary}}, the official dictionary of the Thai language, therefore accepts both pronunciations.
:# There are many other similar cases. Some are shown in the table below.
:# FYI: The Royal Institute of Thailand publishes a popular book called "อ่านอย่างไรและเขียนอย่างไร" ("How to Write?

The 2014 edition (22th edition; {{ISBN|9786167073965}} seems to be its latest edition. But it is in Thai only.

:If I were to design a Thai translit system, I'd want the following:
# Use diacritics for tones rather than numbers; numbers look ugly to me and take up extra room.
# Use double letters rather than macrons; this is necessary with diacritic tonal marks to avoid double diacritics.
# Don't separate syllables with hyphens; that looks ugly to me and takes up lots of extra room.
# Use ''t th d'' rather than ''d t dt''.
:However, if Benjawan Poomsan Becker's system satisfies 1-3 but not 4, then maybe we should go ahead and use it in the interest of using an existing system rather than rolling our own. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:31, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Iudexvivorum}} Thanks for providing this info. Irregular pronunciation was a side question. We still want to transliterate Thai words with irregular pronunciations phonetically. BTW, you can use automatic transliterations for Sanskrit, e.g. {{m|sa|करणि}}, {{m|sa|गर्हा}}, {{m|sa|प्राज्य}}, etc. Unfortunately, it seems that some online dictionaries, including [http://www.thai2english.com/ thai2english] and [http://www.thai-language.com/ thai-language.com] don't always provide phonetic transliterations or respellings for irregular words. (The latter uses yet another transliteration system, which is great for learning but not good for dictionaries) If I get some words wrong, I'd appreciate your corrections!
:: {{ping|Benwing}} I favour Benjawan Poomsan Becker's system but it also uses hyphens, like Thai2English. Hyphens can be either removed or added regardless of what system we choose. It's easier to read Thai correctly when syllables are split by hyphens. Initials and finals are pronounced quite differently in Thai like in many East Asian languages and like many East Asian languages, consonants change pronunciations when they are finals, specifically - s, ch, j, d, dt, t are all pronounced as a clipped "t" [t̚] when they are finals, p, bp, b, f are all [p̚], g, k are [k̚] and n, l and r become [n]. It's important to separate clusters like "kla" from "-k-la", "tra" from "-t-ra", etc. [[User:Stephen G. Brown]] also favours using solid words, without hyphens. There are pros and cons with languages like Thai with both. Textbooks and dictionaries favour hyphens, sometimes spaces after each syllable.
::Shall I make proposed full tables with Benjawan Poomsan Becker's system? --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 11:39, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
::: {{ping|Atitarev}} As for hyphens, I guess I'm used to Pinyin, written without them. But I also kind of would have expected final ''s'', ''ch'', ''j'', etc. to be transcribed as ''t'' to follow the pronunciation. But I imagine whatever Becker does should work fine. If dictionaries tend to use hyphens, for example, then that's what we should do. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 21:35, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

== Feedback on alternative layout for [[Template:de-decl-adj-table]] ==

I created an alternative layout for this template, see [[User:CodeCat/de-adj]]. The three sections for strong, mixed and weak are now merged into one piece, with the distinction instead shown through columns. Please comment; is it better, worse? Should we use it? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 14:50, 3 August 2015 (UTC)

:Your table is more compact. On the other hand, the current arrangement with all strong forms in one place, all weak forms in one place, and all mixed forms in one place seems better for what I expect is the main use of the tables: someone has "[definite article] _ [noun]" or "[indefinite article] _ [noun]" or "_ [noun]" (i.e. they know whether they're looking for a strong or weak or mixed form), and they want to know what ending to put on "rot", for the case and gender they're dealing with, when they plug it into to that blank. Both online ([[:de:Flexion:rot|de.Wikt]], [//www.canoo.net/inflection/rot:A?lookup=caseSensitive Canoo]) and print references seem to favour the "all strong (etc) forms in one place" format. Notably, I would expect printed works to prefer a more space-saving compact format if they didn't think there was a compelling reason for the longer format. OTOH, if your table were rotated 90°, it might be compact enough to have the advantage of fitting all on one screen for mobile users (but as it is, I imagine it's still too wide). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 00:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:: The main reason I made it was to show the similarities of forms between strong, weak and mixed declensions. This is something that I personally always struggled with, so I though a different table layout might help. But I'll leave it then. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:34, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: A slightly different issue -- surely the order "nom gen dat acc" is unhelpful for German? My German textbooks use "nom acc dat gen", which IMO is far better since nom and acc are so often the same. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:37, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: I agree that this order is more helpful. The order used for old Germanic languages is generally nom acc gen dat, and this is still used for Icelandic. I never saw the point in having accusative fourth; it's "traditional", but traditions are superceded when we realise they're stupid. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:11, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Like Benwing, I'd prefer nom-acc-dat-gen. Nom-gen-dat-acc was traditionally the most common order, but I wouldn't mind improving upon tradition, and there certainly are references which have already done so, as Benwing notes; e.g. Günter Kempcke, ''Wörterbuch Deutsch als Fremdsprache'' (2000); Paul G. Graves, Henry Strutz, ''Master the Basics: German'' (1995, {{ISBN|0812090012}}; David Crowner, Klaus Lill ''Impulse: Kommunikatives Deutsch Fur Die Mittelstufe'' (1998, {{ISBN|0395909341}}; Karsten Fink, ''Workbook Deutsch: Das Übungsbuch zu Eine wesentliche Grammatik'' (2014); and even Robert P. Ebert, Oskar Reichmann, Hans-Joachim Solms, ''Frühneuhochdeutsche Grammatik'' (1993), which all use Nom-Akk-Dat-Gen order.

::::::: My only objection is that I am so used to nom-gen-dat-acc that I get confused every time I see nom-acc-dat-gen. But I'll get over it if it's really a better order and we start using it more.

:::::::: Heh, I have the reverse problem. (*looks at second row of inflection table* "what?! there's no way that's the accusative form..." *looks at legend* "oh, it really isn't.") I don't think all languages can necessarily be handled the same; perhaps for some (e.g. Latin) there really is a case for nom-gen order, while for others we already use nom-acc order (e.g. Proto-Germanic, Middle Dutch). I'd rather handle German first and worry about unrelated languages I don't speak later (e.g. Finnish, which uses nom-gen-part-acc, in contrast to Hungarian which uses nom-acc-dat). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:11, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: I agree with [[User:-sche]] that we should do one language at a time. Different languages may have different orders that make the most sense, and also there's the issue of tradition -- German textbooks often prefer nom-acc-dat-gen but Old English textbooks use nom-acc-gen-dat. Sanskrit has a traditional order nom-voc-acc, inst-dat-abl, gen-loc which makes total sense for Sanskrit (and for PIE, and it looks like we indeed use it for PIE) but for Latin the order that makes the most sense might be something like nom-voc-acc, gen-dat, abl-loc, which is similar but moves the genitive. Lithuanian seems to have its own order nom-gen-dat-acc-inst-loc-voc and people working on it might object to changing the order (although personally I think the first two should be nom-voc because they're the same in the plural). [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 01:32, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::: For Slovene, the traditional order is nom-gen-dat-acc-loc-ins, but on Wiktionary that's changed into nom-acc-gen-dat-loc-ins. So here, too, genitive precedes dative. For IE languages with a vocative, the order should indeed be nom-voc-acc, like for Proto-Germanic. Balto-Slavic languages tend to put the vocative last; for Proto-Slavic and Proto-Balto-Slavic we currently use the order nom-acc-gen-loc-dat-ins-voc. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 01:40, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::: Russian seems to do nom-gen-dat-acc-ins-prep which reverses the order of the last two from Slovenian (since "prepositional" is really the locative case). But it would make a lot more sense to move the acc to come after nom, like we do for Slovenian, since the acc is usually the same as either nom or gen (presumably Slovenian is like this too). I guess the point is that the most appropriate order depends somewhat on the language ... for German, acc-dat-gen makes sense since dat and acc are often the same but gen is different, whereas for Russian, acc-gen-dat makes sense since gen and acc are often the same.

They should be left alone until someone manages to fix them up to specify which inflection is involved.

The fact that more languages than were initially thought use {{temp|inflected form of}} may mean we want to go back to the general-purpose template and use langcodes, rather than using language-specific templates — if so, we can do that, since nothing was deleted, but rather only renamed.

* Manual creation of a subset of word's inflected forms should be banned, and such entries deleted. Making such entries only complicates botting the rest of the inflection in the future. Too much time is wasted cleaning up such entries. If you are creating inflected forms manually either create it entirely for a lemma, using one and only one template, or don't create it at all. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 09:13, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
*: No it shouldn't, and no they shouldn't. I don't know how to use a bot, and I don't always have the time to create entries for all the inflected forms. I often create entries only for those inflected forms that already exist as spellings in other languages. For example, if some random Irish or Old Irish verb form happens to share a spelling with an existing Spanish entry, I'll create the Irish form there, but I won't bother creating brand-new entries for all the other forms of the verb. In other words, I'll work to remove orange links from inflection tables, but not (always) black/red ones. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 10:39, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
*:: Extinct languages like Old Irish which have irregular paradigms and limited attestation of inflection should of course be manually treated.

== {{temp|ux}} in Eastern Mari? ==

Recently, {{user|CodeCat}} changed the format of the examples in Eastern Mari ''[[лум]]'', inserting {{temp|ux}}. The result looked like this: [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BC&oldid=33764187#Eastern_Mari]. I certainly understand the need to use standard templates, but the resulting format was much less compact and less practical: three lines per example (including transliteration). Since I thought one line per example would be nicer on the eye and easier for anyone actually interested in seeing how the word can be used, I reverted her change. But I wondered if it wouldn't be possible to change said templates (or create a new one) that has the one-line-per-example format, and keep using it. Would that be a problem to anyone? Is there a reason why the three-line-per-example format should be preferred to the one-line-per-example one? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:02, 4 August 2015 (UTC)

:::: It's hard to determine length other than by counting characters, which is not so accurate. I think it is better to leave it as is.

== Sourcing etymologies? ==

Recently, in Latvian {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, I reverted a change that introduced a Proto-Baltic reconstruction in the Etymology section, without proper sourcing. Given the way the text was written, it would seem that the Proto-Baltic proposed reconstruction came from Karulis' ''Latviešu Etimoloģijas Vārdnīca'', when in fact it came from an as yet unpublished article by R. Kim. I changed the format, to make it clearer where the Proto-Baltic form was taken from. Can't we perhaps agree on a general policy for Etymology sections whereby we try to explicitly source what is what -- so that, if two protoforms from different sources are cited, the reader can know which was proposed by which source? The format doesn't have to be the one I used in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, of course, but it would be nice to have something that would avoid this kind of confusion.
A second, unrelated question is whether unpublished sources should be accepted in Wiktionary. I'd say no: let it be published before it can be cited here. But I don't know what the others here think. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:19, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
: My general issue with your etymologies is that they're huge blocks of text. They need to be structured better in order to be readable. The long list of cognates is not necessary either, especially if we already have PIE pages and, more recently, categories to hold them. At the very least, they should be made collapsible or presented in a separate paragraph to make the rest easier to read.
:: This is of course not the problem I wanted to talk about here, but OK, there we go...
:: The 'huge blocks of text' are necessary when the etymology is not simple, or is disputed, or involves changes, semantic or otherwise, that are not obvious, as in {{m|lv|liegt}}. When the etymology is simple -- just PIE to PB to the word, without semantic changes, as in {{m|lv|acs}}, you have only one short sentence. I suppose your problem here is how much information should be given: should there be only a reference to the etymon, with no indication of how you got from that form and from that meaning to the current state? Or should more information be provided? I, for one, favor the latter, because this extra information is important to judge and accept the etymology, and are part of the history of the word, which is what the etymology section is about. It is also often interesting and brings new light to the understanding of the word, as several other people here told me when commenting favorably on the 'huge blocks of text' that you dislike. Call that 'humanistic etymology' if you will.
::: I don't have anything against presenting a lot of information. My problem is more the way it's presented. One giant paragraph doesn't invite the user to read it, and instead they'll just go tl;dr at it. If I want to know, at a glance, what the origin is, I don't want to have to read through a lot of blabber to get to the point. So what I would suggest is to write etymologies focus first on the known and reconstructed history, and leave the details until later. That way, people who aren't interested in the extra details can skip them, rather than having to sift through. Make the information that users want more accessible by splitting it. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:26, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Most users don't want to look at etymologies, they just want to see what the word means; so they won't read the etymology (or at the alternative forms, or the pronunciation) at all. If they glance at the etymology section, they're as likely to go tl;dr at mysterious cabalistic symbols like ''*h₃ḗHḱ-ō'' as they are at longish texts. Only if they are interested will they  read it. Interestingly, the information I present is already in the format you suggest: the very first sentence gives the PB and the PIE etymon, you don't have to read any further than that. Perhaps the only necessary change here is to add a carriage return after that first sentence, to put the rest of the information in a separate paragraph? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::The list of cognates is less relevant, I agree. The only problem is that different sources often quote different cognates, and this may be a problem. One solution is to bypass cognates altogether, but this only works for the (relatively few) 'famous' words or roots that already have reconstructed forms here at Wiktionary (where one can add cognates and refer to the specific sources that mention them. But over 90% of Latvian words for which Karulis' LEV gives etymologies are not in this category: rather, they are words with only a couple of cognates, mostly in Baltic (e.g. {{m|lv|liegt}}) or maybe a couple of other non-Baltic languages. It will be a long time before those etyma have Wiktionary pages, so eliminating these cognates looks like a bad idea. I would agree, though, with the cases in which there is already a good Appendix page with the etymon (as long as different cognates proposed by different sources are clearly distinguished there). Do you have one such example, so we could discuss the format further?
::: If sources conflict, then Wiktionary has to find a compromise through the usual consensus process. Consensus may invalidate some sources or even all of them, or choose a particular one that seems most usable by the people discussing the matter. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:28, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Sure. Let it happen, then. The LEV, for instance, cites cognates that are not cited in some Wiktionary reconstructed entries; should I add them? Or should I start somewhere a discussion about whether or not to do this? Or whether or not the LEV is a good source? And, if so, where? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
: Showing different takes on the issue by different people is good. I think the best way to present it would be through an unordered list. See for example {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:24, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Back to the problem at hand. Yes, that would be good, so separate paragraphs for your PBS etymologies (with correct sourcing) might be a good idea. You could start such paragraphs with 'According to a diffferent source,...' and then add the information. Or you could mention the forms with a footnote to the source, as I did in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}. Either way would be OK with me, as long as the wording is fluent and there is no confusion as to what comes from where. What I would disagree with is what you did before: just adding a form with no sourcing to a text that is itself attributed to a specific source, as if that form also came from the same source  (i.e., your original PBS etymon at {{m|lv|ūdrs}} looked like it came from Karulis' LEV, when in fact it came from Kim's unpublished paper). 
:: Besides, note that English {{m|en|fang}} (from {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}) -- where you find one of those 'huge blocks of text' you so much dislike -- does NOT mention the two proposed PIE etyma mentioned under {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}: rather, it only mentions the first one, and without references to sources. So the information under {{m|en|fang}} is misleading at best. Shouldn't such things be changed in a more principled way, so that a reconstructed entry does not seem to be in contradiction with the information found in the etymology section of one of its reflexes? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:: And I would add that I don't think it's a good idea, in principle, to cite unpublished sources. (But maybe Kim's paper has already been published? It was going to come out in a Handbook, as I recall; maybe it is already there?) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:12, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: This is the problem with the paragraph approach that you use. You source the whole paragraph, which makes it impossible for anyone to make adjustments to the text. Any edits make it no longer faithful to the source. Instead what should be sourced is individual facts. That way, people can add or change things without invalidating the references. Again, splitting etymologies into separate sections with paragraph breaks and lists should help with that. Again look at {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}: each list item has its own separate sourcing.
:::: Yet I did source other forms in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, for example, so that it is clear that the PBS form is not from the LEV; just put the footnote next to the material from the other source, not at the end of the paragraph. Why not make it standard practice? Another possibility is simply to start a new paragraph with a different source, perhaps starting with "A different source claims that..." or something similar. So this isn't a problem. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: I'm not sure what you mean by unpublished sources. If they are available, then they are public, right? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:26, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: An unpublished article has not yet passed peer review. It may be complete nonsense, or more likely it may have a few minor errors that will be corrected before publishing. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:20, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Nowadays everything is on the internet: manuscripts, unpublished sources, papers at various levels of completion... because we always want to invite comments from other interested researchers, comments that may improve a paper even before it's completely finished (academia.edu is a great site for this, as are individual researchers' pages at their institution website). When a paper is ''published'', however, it is officially released, be it on paper, be it in a publishing website. After that, it can no longer be edited or altered; and the year of its publication becomes fixed. Also, a published paper went through a refereeing process in which it was read and commented upon by two or three of the author's peers; an unpublished paper, of course, didn't. So the jist of it is that an unpublished paper is (supposed to be) less good and less final than its published version. Its author, for instance, wouldn't like you to cite an unpublished version if there is a published one alreday. (Kim's paper states quite clearly -- at the end, I think -- that it is an unpublished version, to appear in a Handbook of something or other). --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Different pages conflicting on each other is an unfortunate effect of how Wiktionary works. There's not much that can be done about it other than checking and updating things regularly. I would say that generally, the reconstruction pages are more reliable than the etymologies within entries, as they've been created and reviewed by more knowledgeable editors. Etymologies in entries often tend to be copied from just one source, often an outdated or nonspecialised one. They are then inserted into entries by editors who are relatively inexperienced with such matters, so that they are not able to spot and correct problems in their sources. And then, when new entries are created for cognate terms, then the etymologies are just copied over. This tends to propagate old/bad etymologies. And it's one of the reasons I prefer keeping etymologies to a bare minimum and letting the proto-language pages handle the rest. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:33, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: This is, again, difficult for words that have a more complicated history, as I mentioned above. For such words, their etymology section is the only place where, say, discussing a strange semantic evolution or comparing two or three different etymologies is logical: after all, in the reconstructed entries, you are not interested in the details of the semantic evolution of one reflex in one sub-branch of the family (I haven't seen a single reconstructed proto-entry here that does that); rather, the focus is on the reconstructed protoform and how it fits in the proto-system. So I think you would lose more than gain by doing that. The only thing that I would indeed relegate to the reconstructed entries is the list of cognates -- assuming that we can source cognates that occur in only one source, for instance.
:::: And here's a final thought: if inconsistencies are unavoidable at Wiktionary, if no policy can be devised to address them, then we're basically giving up on the idea that Wiktionary can become a quality work. No -- I'm sure something can be done. Wikipedia found solutions, so can Wiktionary. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)

* I support banning original research with reconstructions in etymologies, as well as inventive editorial corrections, such as how "ū́drā́-" (the form cited in the article by R.K.) became "ūdrāˀ (which is what CodeCat inserted in the etymology). Additionally, for protolanguages, when there is no accepted general framework, which is the cases with Proto-Baltic/Proto-Balto-Slavic, all of the competing theories should be presented on an equal footing. That means that there can be no single and "true" reconstruction, and that there could be multiple inflection tables for a word according to different sources. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 10:19, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
::Agreed. And since the number of reconstructed entries in Wiktionary is not so high, this is probably quite feasible, isn't it?

:: I oppose a ban on editorial corrections; to fail to harmonize notation schemes is misleading. In both Menominee (living language) and Proto-Algonquian (reconstructed language), for example, most people notate long vowels like <samp>a·</samp>, but some people write <samp>aː</samp>, <samp>a:</samp> or <samp>ā</samp>. To have individual words/forms in different systems based on who attested the particular word/form (e.g. <samp>''fooba·r'', plural ''foobārs''</samp>) would confuse readers into thinking the vowels were of some different quality.

:::I agree with -sche here; notation schemes should be harmonized to the extent that this is a simple case of equivalent notations. As for "ū́drā́-" vs. "ūdrāˀ", it's not obvious to me what's going on here. Do the two acute accents indicate Balto-Slavic acute? If so, then it's fine to convert them to use the superscript glottal stop, which can be viewed as simply another way of indicating the BS acute register -- the fact that it expresses an opinion as to how that register was phonologically realized is irrelevant here. But then shouldn't it be "ūˀdrāˀ"? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 07:16, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Using acute accent marks to indicate the acute is actually very misleading, because Proto-Balto-Slavic ''also'' had a proper phonemic word accent like that of PIE. We should definitely use the same symbol, ´, to denote the accent in both of them. Anything else would just be unnecessarily confusing. That said, it does seem that there is somewhat of a linguistic consensus that the acute register involved some kind of glottal feature. The Latvian broken tone is a direct continuation of the acute, and is realised as glottalisation. So if there is any ''serious'' disagreement among linguists about the approximate nature of the acute, then I would like to hear about it. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:42, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

:::::::I think it does have an acute, it's just mis-written.

== Sourcing etymologies ''bis'': a proposal ==
Well, here is a modest proposal for sourcing (and otherwise formatting) etymologies in etymology sections:
* For "simple" etymologies (A < proto-B ''AA'' < proto-C ''AAA''),
(a) State ''in the first sentence'' what the path is from the current form to the oldest protoform you want to cite ('From proto-B ''AA'', from proto-C ''AAA''). Make it a separate paragraph.<br>
(b) Further infomration (semantic evolution, irregular transformations, etc.) can be described in the following paragraph, if need be, as succinctly as possible.
* For "complicated" etymologies (there are several suggested paths or etyma):
(a) Start with "There are (two, three, several) proposed hypotheses:";<br>
(b) State each hypothesis in a single sentence in a separate paragraph, starting with a letter -- (a), (b), (c), etc. -- to identify the hypothesis;<br>
(c) If further information is necessary on a given hypothesis, add it in a separate paragraph after all the hypothesVes, referring back to it by its letter.
* Cognates would be listed, ''in full agreement with the source'' (i.e., no tampering with the data!) in a separate paragraph at the end. If one of the protoforms (preferably the oldest) already has a good, consensus-approved entry in the Appendix, then all, cognates to that entry, ''making sure that each cognate is duly and correctly sourced''. (This is not the current state in most reconstructed entries here, and those interested in entering protoforms should add their sources.)
What do y'all think?
:I'm impressed with the detail you put into [[ūdrs]]. My only suggestion would be to put the cognates into a separate paragraph to avoid the "wall of text" feeling. It sounds like you're in agreement with this. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:37, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

:: In this case I actually agree. But before removing them, we need to solve inconsistencies. So there are cognates in my source that aren't mentioned in {{m|ine-pro|*udrós}}. Should I copy them and source them there? How about the fact that my source menitons a Proto-Baltic form, whereas {{m|ine-pro|*udrós}} lists only Proto-Balto-Slavic? I agree that basically cognates (at least for the 'richer' words with cognates in many branches) should be in the reconstructed entry page, but we need to know which forms should be there, from which sources... or else we simply don't know what kind of information we have there. In [[ūdrs]], at least I know who made the claim and where.

::: Yes, you can add the cognates to the proto-entry and source them there. That way the information from LEV can be enjoyed by everyone, not just the viewers of the Latvian page. For the format of referencing individual descendants you can look at {{m|ine-pro|*tep-}}. As to which descendants should be there and from which sources, I think at first ''all'' descendants from ''all'' sources can be added. If people have objections, a centralized discussion will happen on the talk page of the proto-entry or in [[WT:ES]]. The bad cognates from outdated sources will be eventually weeded out.

Sure, LEV says "from Proto-Baltic", but we understand that in essence what he is saying is that {{m|lv|ūdrs}} is from PIE {{m|ine-pro|*udrós}}, whatever the intermediate details. When my dated Armenian equivalent of LEV says {{m|xcl|հոտ}} is from PIE *''ōd''-, I understand that I should list it under modern PIE {{m|ine-pro|*h₃ed-}} and still reference my old source. I have seen it done by academic scholars. Martirosyan 2010 can write that a source in 1920s derives a word from such-and-such PIE root and use modern reconstruction for that root. It seems to me that you are trying to give a literal translation of LEV in Wiktionary. That is a job for Wikisource, not Wiktionary.

I can understand CodeCat's objection to the form ''ū́drā́'' with acute accents indicating the acute register (i.e. it conflicts with the conventional use of accents to indicate stress, which is also phonemic in Balto-Slavic, and it's inconsistent with the way other Balto-Slavic entries have been formatted in Wiktionary [granted, it was CodeCat doing that formatting]), but in that case, she should have just undone that one change, with explanation, rather than the whole thing. I also agree with Vahag that we should feel free to modernize/canonicalize proto-forms and such. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 10:05, 7 August 2015 (UTC) 
:::::::: This is not about canonicalization. Those glottal stops are phonemes on their own in the reconstruction of Proto-Balto-Slavic by the Leiden School, and according to it only after the parent language disintegration did individual branches developed their own acute/circumflex distinctions. The notation with acute accents by R. K. is an entirely different reconstruction, where acute accent marks indicate intonation/tone. Those two also have different originating points - the glottalic theory of PIE vs. the standard PIE Frankenstein's monster with laryngeals, genders and thematic inflection existing contemporaneously. You can't mix those two notations, because they refer to two different protolanguages, in two different chronological stages. There are also other differences that go beyond mere characters substitutions. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 12:19, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: I think my point still stands, though, that these ''can'' be viewed as equivalent notations, with acute register vs. non-acute register marked either by acute accent vs. tilde (or circumflex) accent or by presence or absence of superscript glottal stop, without necessarily committing to a phonological interpretation of the notation. As long as it's agreed that there was a two-way register distinction -- regardless of whether that is interpreted as tonal, as glottal, or whatever -- then the notations are equivalent in that you can convert from one to the other without loss of information, and we may as well be consistent. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 12:53, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::: What does the "two-way register distinction" actually mean? It's a meaningless notion, vague and abstract. Those symbols mean different things in different protolanguages. Leiden School theory also has short *o and *a, and different assumptions on ''Auslautgesetze'' and paradigms leading to different endings and forms in inflections. Also, some of the origins of the glottal stop or "acute" are disputed (Winter's law formulation, long/hyperlong vowles), which in particular renders the acute accent notation inapplicable, whereas with the glottal stop you can just use parentheses as is the customary notation for optional parts of reconstruction. Lastly, the superscript notation is baised as to the phonation character of what you call the Balto-Slavic "acute register" - there are different theories (rising/falling tone, glottalization/stod). It's best not to mix those two protolanguages, and use two different reconstructions. There are some Proto-Slavic appendices that already do it like that. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 13:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
{{outdent}} "register distinction" is an abstract way of referring to a distinction with unknown phonetics, but it's certainly not meaningless, and more than the three laryngeals of PIE, which are equally abstract. No one would have any problem regularizing e.g. Ringe's laryngeal notation, where he writes something like ''ç x xʷ'' in his Tocharian book, into more standard ''h₁ h₂ h₃'', even though they may have a completely different interpretation of what these symbols mean phonologically. Differences that cannot be treated as notational variants, e.g. differences in which register or vowel length is reconstructed in a particular word, or in numbers of vowels, obviously shouldn't be confounded, but when there's an equivalence to be made between notational variants I don't see the point of not making it. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 17:00, 7 August 2015 (UTC)  
: But the difference is that the glottal stop is not a mere "abstract register". It's a phoneme with a very specific phonetic value. Nobody disputes the phonemic status of PIE laryngeals. The differences between the protolanguage described by Ronald Kim (which has no glottal stop as a phoneme, and "acute" is a property of certain vowels) and the one of the Leiden School are irreconcilable and these two should not be mixed. This "canonicalization" is a thinly-veiled attempt at giving undue prominence to certain theories at the expense of others. It should be resisted and denounced. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 17:09, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:: The difference you mention is nothing more than relative chronology and allophony. Compare the sequence -Vnh- in Proto-Germanic. It eventually gave way to -Ṽ:h-, with a long nasal vowel. It doesn't matter in the slightest whether we write one or the other, because they represent the same phonological units. It's merely a matter of phonetic interpretation, but notation certainly does not have to indicate any particular phonetic reality. The same applies here with the acute. The interpretation in which there is an actual glottal stop, and the one in which there is merely glottalisation or some other change in the vowel, are different interpretations of the same phonological units. How you interpret it phonetically, or denote it in writing, is completely irrelevant to what it ''is''. It's the acute, nothing more, nothing less. Whatever symbol we choose to show that it's there is equally valid, because it's just a symbol that says "acute is here". —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:00, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::I am not trying to give prominence to one theory over another. I'd be just as happy if you denote the acute with a superscript A, and the non-acute with a superscript B (or vice-versa). That makes it obvious that we're talking about what is ultimately an abstract register difference. It is entirely analogous to the situation in Old Chinese, where everyone agrees there was a distinction between "Type A" and "Type B" syllables but no one agrees what the relevant feature was. Some think type B syllables have an extra /j/ phoneme before the vowel, some think type A syllables have pharyngealization of the syllable-initial consonant, some think the difference is vowel length, some think it's a phonation difference (creakiness/breathiness/whatever), etc. But these theories are hardly irreconcilable just because of this. My concern is not to favor one theory over another but to avoid needless complication introduced by notational differences. Since you don't seem to ever believe in canonicalizing notations, we might end up just having to agree to disagree. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 19:45, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

:Two points that have been made in previous discussions: one, we have to recognize that many obvious derivations are not cited, e.g. it is unlikely that a dictionary has gone through Spanish's (or, even more likely, Rumantsch's) massive corpus of words inherited from Latin and noted, in each and every case "yep, ''this one too'' was inherited from its obvious Latin predecessor, rather than, like, borrowed from Welsh or something". The same sort of research we undertake to determine what words mean, and e.g. how they inflect (in contradistinction to [[Appendix:English dictionary-only terms|what scholars and authorities think they mean]] and [[regnen|how scholars and authorities think they inflect]]), will sometimes be necessary when tracing etymologies. Two, it would be misleading and foolish not to allow for standardization of notation schemes, [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary%3ABeer_parlour%2F2015%2FAugust&type=revision&diff=33768829&oldid=33768735 as I note above].

:{{ping|Pereru}} There's still a bit of a "wall of text" effect, since the paragraph break is barely visible. If it could be set off better, I think people would object less. An alternative is to just list a few cognates, the subjectively most "interesting" ones (e.g. Greek, Sanskrit) and put the rest on a reconstruction page; and if such a page doesn't exist, create it. I personally don't object to seeing all the cognates listed on the Latvian page, but I understand the objections of the others, and I also see how it's likely to lead to inconsistencies (e.g. you give an etymology for the unexpected ''l'' and ''t'' in {{m|la|lutra}} whereas the reconstruction page doesn't and says it's unknown. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 07:23, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
::Does indenting the cognate paragraph make it look better (see [[ūdrs]])? As for cognates in general, I do understand the feelings, but there are too few reconstructed entries in Wiktionary for all cognates to be easily transferable (and given that there are discussions about "what the right form" is, I'm a bit afraid of creating hundreds of new reconstructed pages on the authority of my Latvian source, the LEV, just to see them moved to other titles, or incorporated into other pages, etc.; I'd rather wait till there are more solid criteria. I frankly think Wiktionary simply follows no real policy on dealing with reconstructed entries, etymological sources, etc. -- everybody pretty much does whatever s/he wants... For differences between sources, case in point: Latin ''l'' in {{m|lv|lutra}}. I simply copied what my source had on this problem, while the reconstructed page made that claim apparently on the basis of an old etymological dictionary of Ossetian (though it is not clear whether the reference refers to the entire page or only to the reconstructed protoform -- again, we lack a good format for these things). Should we mention both? Only the most recent? The best source? Again, where's the policy?... --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 08:43, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
:::Indenting is better, although not perfect. I also tried indenting with ':' (where you don't see the bullet point) and setting the paragraph off with two blank lines. All are possibilities.
:::As for there being no real policy on reconstructed entries, I think you're right.

[[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:11, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'd like to have OP's third point clarified a bit. First, "listing cognates in full agreement with the source": sources on languages that have been unwritten or scarcely written until recently will often utilize technical or otherwise non-standard orthography or transcription; but I would suggest that this does not mean we are obliged to provide a separate source for the actual native orthography. E.g. the Udmurt reflex of Proto-Uralic {{m|urj-pro|*käle}} is {{m|udm|кыл}}, but all basic sources appear to list only the transliteration ''kyl'', ''kïl'', ''kɨl'' or ''ki̮l''. (And, as mentioned above, I agree that transcription schemes should definitely be unified here as well.)
:Second, would "making sure that each cognate is duly sourced" involve simply watching that people don't add new cognates out of the blue, or actually adding an inline citation for every single cognate? The latter would sound like overkill, whenever the majority of a cognate list is based on a reliable and comprehensive source, such as authoritative major etymological dictionary (or dictionaries), and is not explicitly contradicted by other equally reliable sources. Not every language group necessarily has such a source available of course, and establishing what sources to consider "reliable by default" (and to what extent — often a source might be quite reliable for ''cognates'' but outdated for ''reconstructions'' or ''etymologies'') should be determined by the consensus of editors involved with the language or language group in question.
:For "unexpected" cognates that are added from somewhere else than from a standard source (say, if someone were to release a paper arguing that Mongolian {{m|mn|хэл}} is a Uralic loanword), I'd be in favor of annotating the etymologies in more detail, but it should probably be sufficient doing this on the "main" etymology hubs — the entry's own page and its posited origin's entry (whether an attested form or a reconstructed proto-form) — rather than on every single page that refers to it. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 11:52, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::Here are my personal opinions on the clarifications you ask about:
:::'''(a)''' "In full agreement with the source" is not supposed to mean that you can't regularize transcriptions, as long as this is described in a policy page (e.g., [[WK:Etymology]] or [[WK:About Proto-Uralic]] or something like that), so that the interested reader can always see what can be one to source transcriptions.
:::'''(b)''' "Making sure that every cognate has a source" is meant as making sure the reader can tell where cognates came from. So, if all cognates come from the same source (some authoritative etymological dictoinary, for instance), you can refer to it only once at the end of the page. But then it becomes necessary to indicate deviations if they occur. If someone adds a new cognate to this page that happens not to come from the common source, then this cognate needs a footnote indicating its source, so the reader isn't fooled into thinking it is from the same source as the others. In short: don't necessarily add a footnote to every cognate, but always make it possible for the reader to know where the cognate comes from. If it's an original suggestion of a Wiktionarian (e.g., CodeCat, who is into original research), then also say so by adding an "original research" template. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:55, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
As I see it, a discussion on '''allowing "Notes" as a valid header''' should be considered.

Vahag has brought this up ([[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#.7B.7Breflist.7D.7D]]) and I'm running into a similar problem all the time. As ridiculously silly of an argument as it may be, I do, in fact, agree that numbered and bulleted references together look ugly AF. (I have even went to such ridiculous steps as removing a reference that didn't add anything critical just because it was bulleted while the other ones were numbered because of how unappealing it looks.)

In more general terms, I kind of get the feeling that there seems to be consensus that references are in fact valuable and add value to the entry, perhaps the discussion should focus more on how to allow more elegant ways of faithfully citing content, particularly in "controversial" cases, e.g., obviously one bulleted reference is enough under, say, an assertion that et {{m|et|kala}} and liv {{m|liv|kalā}} derive from the same source because, well, it's pretty obvious but then if there is a "weird" controversial cognate there isn't even a way of citing it inline (unless you want the awful looking mixing of numbered and bulleted refs.)

== Transliteration obligatory? ==
It seems that transliterating non-latin scripts has become obligatory in all templates, but in certain cases -- "latin-like" scripts like Cyrilic or Greek -- I think transliteration actually annoys more than it helps. Why is transliteration, especially of Cyrilic and Greek, obligatory in all cases, including inflection tables and examples? I would rather have it only next to the headword... Case in point: Eastern Mari ''[[лум]]'', where having two Mari lines is somewhat disruptive. Can't we have a parameter <code>tr=-</code> (which is what I used in this case) to avoid the obligatory transliteration? As things are, the only option is not to use templates... which I would prefer not to do. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:47, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
:Generally, we transliterate everything in Wiktionary -- we don't assume readers are able to handle foreign scripts.

[[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 07:48, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
::I would also say that translit is especially important for an obscure language like Eastern Mari -- even though it's "just" Cyrillic, it invariably has different conventions from more familiar languages like Russian.

::{{ping|Atitarev}}, maybe I'm making this seem more important to me than it really is. It all boils down to an esthetical preference: examples plus translations tend to already be long enough, if you still add transliterations the result will often be longer than one line, and that offends my sense of proportion. I would prefer no transliterations even in languages whose script I don't read (I can read the Thai script, so that's not a big deal for me, but, for instance, I don't read Chinese characers; and yet, for me, lines with just the original Chinese example and a translation look nicer than those with the transliteration). The esthetics gets especially bad with inflection tables, which become at least twice larger than they need to be only to accommodate transliterations. Now, I understand and agree that others have a right to think differently, and I won't mind too terribly if things remain as they are.

== Eastern Mari possessed forms ==
I'm thinking about how to do a template that will include possessed forms in Eastern Mari, but because every possessed form ('my house', 'your house', etc.) can also be inflected for ten cases, singular and plural ('my house', 'in my house', 'in my houses', 'to my house', 'to my houses', etc.), we end up having 6 persons x 20 cases x 2 numbers = 240 forms, most of which are predictably formed. This means creating tables that are rather big and unwieldy. I was wondering if someone working with similar cases (in other Finno-Ugric languages, or in Turkish, etc.) has found a better solution that just creating big tables? (Right now, I'm tempted to make each non-possessed declined form -- e.g., 'my house' -- an independent sublemma, with its own case inflection table under it, but I'm not sure this is the best solution.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:56, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
: I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I vaguely remember someone saying that you can nest collapsible boxes.

== Make Proto-Baltic an etymology-only language ==

Linguists don't all agree on the nature of the Baltic languages as a group. There are three main proposals, that I know of:
# Balto-Slavic splits into Baltic and Slavic. Baltic then split into East and West Baltic. (this is the traditional view)
# Balto-Slavic splits into East Baltic and Slavic-West Baltic. Slavic-West Baltic then split into Slavic and West Baltic.
# Balto-Slavic splits into East Baltic, West Baltic and Slavic.
Proto-Baltic only exists in the first of these proposals. Moreover, it has been noted that there aren't really any common linguistic changes that separate Proto-Baltic from Proto-Balto-Slavic. As reconstructed, the two are essentially identical.

In the past, we've deleted and merged different proto-languages when there is no definite agreement on their existence and definition, and when they are too similar to their parent language to make separate pages for them worthwhile. For example, Proto-Finno-Permic and Proto-Finno-Ugric were recently merged into Proto-Uralic. There was also a discussion on merging various Polynesian languages, although I'm not sure where that went. In any case, I don't see the value in having separate pages for Proto-Baltic reconstructions when they're all just going to be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic reconstructions. So I think that Proto-Baltic should be changed into an etymology-only language, so that it can be mentioned with {{temp|etyl}}, but there can be no entries or links to it. All existing links would be changed to Proto-Balto-Slavic. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:14, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

(I tentatively support ''a'' merger between the appendices; bear in mind that we could still cover in prose differences between Baltic and Balto-Slavic of they were to come up.

* '''Support'''. Like Benwing, my understanding of the scholarship is that Baltic is not a genetic group and there was no Proto-Baltic. Even Derksen, who writes of Proto-Baltic, says "I am not convinced that it is justified to reconstruct a Proto-Baltic stage; the term Proto-Baltic is used for convenience’s sake." ''Reconstructing Prehistorical Dialects: Initial Vowels in Slavic and Baltic'' says "Baltic scholars who have concerned themselves with this question conclude that one cannot reconstructed a Proto-Baltic." The situation seems comparable to Proto-Algonquian, which was initially reconstructed as Proto-Central-Algonquian (contrasted with Eastern and Plains), before scholars realized that only Eastern was a genetic group with a proto-language ([[PEA]]), and that what had been reconstructed as [[PCA]] was, with only a few minor changes here and there, simply Proto-Algonquian.

*: But there is the question of accuracy. Since PBS still hasn't really been reconstructed (no etymological dictionary), mentioning fleeting forms or original research should only be done ''explicitly'', which is not (yet) done here as policy. What is available out there often does have PB, not PBS, forms -- only those few words that are important for an author's paper, such as the Derksen paper you cite. In the absence of a body of consensus reconstructions for Proto-Balto-Slavic, disregarding the Proto-Baltic ones or changing them automatically into Proto-Balto-Slavic is simply too hasty. The work hasn't been done yet to justify this. We're still at "Proto Central Algonquian" time; to assume that the work of demonstrating that all those forms are simply "Proto Algonquian" has already been done is at best temerary. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:36, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

::::: One of them tried to hijack the Wikipedia pages on the subject not that long ago. As to Benwing's confusion: the issue isn't whether it's a clade, but whether the details have been worked out on the proto-language. Also, proto-languages are theoretical constructs that are only as good as the information on which they're based: including Slavic in a reconstruction provides extra material to work with, so a PB reconstruction may not be as a complete a picture as a PBS one. I have no problem with documenting that a referenced reconstruction was for PB rather than PBS. My main issue has been with ''categorizing'' entries as ''derived from'' PB.

== Adding our own diacritics in quotations of prose works printed without them ==

I've had an ongoing debate in the past with [[User:Atitarev]] about whether we should add stress marks to quotations of Russian prose. He believes that this is helpful to readers, but I am against this for a number of reasons. Firstly, I believe that out of respect to the author and publisher, all of our quotations should reproduce as closely as possible the original work with the exception of the bolding we add to the word(s) that the quote is demonstrating. Secondly, this forces us in some instances to choose between two or more equally acceptable stress variants of some words, or worse in some cases between two or more homographs with different meanings. Note that this does not apply as much to poetry from which stress can be inferred by the meter, or to songs or movies in which the stress can be heard. This problem is significantly exacerbated in languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, where would not only be inferring stress, but also vowels, leaving much more possibility for ambiguity.

The question is: Should we (Wiktionary) do this in general? Should we do this for languages like Russian, even if not for languages like Hebrew and Arabic? Should we do this even for languages like Hebrew and Arabic? Should we remove diacritics from quotations where we have already added them? --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
: As far as I know, the practice is to leave quotes relatively unchanged. I don't think we add macrons to Latin or old Germanic quotes, for example. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:37, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Adding macrons to Latin is a completely different story, because these texts are often already printed with macrons. I'm not talking about always sticking with the most original quote version of the quote, but about sticking to existing publications. This question mostly applies to relatively modern quotations. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:55, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::: As for Arabic, stress of course doesn't really apply, but I think it would be a huge help to the reader to add the vowels to the extent that they can be inferred reasonably unambiguously. Reading Arabic is '''hard''' for non-fluent speakers due to the underspecified text, esp. with verbs. I think in the case of Russian, similar arguments could be made -- if you're concerned about ambiguous cases, just leave off the stress in those cases or (perhaps better) follow [[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]]'s convention of putting a stress mark in each possible place of stress. I'd also like to see individual words inside quotes linked -- again it would be a great help for the language learner. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 16:26, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Not all the quotations we include need to be targeted toward beginners. We can have usage examples with the full diacritics, which would be helpful for beginners. But quotations are meant to show how the words are really used in reality; and in reality, Russian is not written with stress marks and Arabic is not written with vowels. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: In reality we always (or should always) transliterate Arabic text, at the very least. (And who's to decide what's targeted towards beginners and what's not? The same arguments could be made for not transliterating at all.) [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 19:49, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: What I mean is that not ''everything'' needs to be targeted toward beginners who can't read without vowels. And even for people who are not so comfortable reading without vowels, it's not as hard when you already know what word you're looking at. With transliteration, we're not actually altering the original text; the original is still there and anyone who doesn't want or need the transliteration can ignore it. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:19, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

: When we're giving a direct quote, we should keep the original spelling of the whole quote, i.e. without Russian stress marks (unless we happen to be quoting some text that for whatever reason uses them). We should also keep '''е''' for '''ё''' if that's how it was spelled in the original. (I don't quite understand why we allow '''ё''' in page names in the first place.) We can include stress marks in the transliteration if need be, though that will mean writing the transliteration out manually instead of letting it happen automatically. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 10:55, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
::We allow '''ё''' in the page names because this is a dictionary convention, it's so also in the Russian Wiktionary. The Russian Wikipedia makes the letter mandatory throughout articles and many native speakers prefer to write it all the time. Letter '''ё''' isn't exactly banned in Russian! It's also considered a separate letter, not a '''е''' with '''two dots''' (две точки). Every Russian dictionary uses it in the alphabetical order. Knowing that '''ё''' is replaced with '''е''' by native speakers lets you figure out how to spell it in the real world. For the same reason, I don't see how adding stress marks, normalising texts with '''ё''', adding Arabic or Hebrew diacritics, Japanese furigana is a problem in quotations. Many editors suggest photographic image of the original texts, even using the glyphs. Modern Russian books don't reprint texts in the pre-1918 reform spellings. China republished all old books in the simplified script. Japanese publishers partially follow the post-war reform.
::Another point, some Russian books appear in accented forms with consistent usage of '''ё''', designed for foreigners or children. Or Arabic texts can be with or without vocalisations. Japanese texts appear with [[furigana]] ([[ruby]]) to help with the pronunciation, especially when aiming at young readers.
::My strong opinion is that dictionary should be user-friendly and help master languages, it's about the language, not the facts. Showing how languages are written out there in the real world can be described in appendices. Learners learn this as the first thing. For me, a learner of Arabic, is much more useful to have vocalised Arabic then telling me over and over again that diacritics are not used by Arabs.

WikiTiki's and Anatoli's disagreement is very deep and philosophical. It stems from the disagreement over the purpose of Wiktionary. Anatoli and his camp see Wiktionary mainly as a learning tool for non-native speakers. Hence the reading aids in quotations, the note in [[Template:ru-adj1]] and the unscientific, pronunciation-based transliteration system for Russian. The other camp, which includes me, sees Wiktionary as a scholarly resource, a kind of an encyclopaedia of language, useful for native speakers too. One side wants to write an ''[[w:Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|OALD]]'', the other an ''OED''. Both projects are useful and have a right to exist, but we have to choose one. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 13:56, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'm not sure what you mean by "unscientific" here. Also, maybe I'm an optimist but I think it's possible to resolve this issue through compromise. As for OALD vs. OED, keep in mind this is the English Wiktionary, and hence designed for English speakers. That means that foreign-language entries are inevitably geared somewhat towards language learners, just like all cross-language dictionaries. I don't think there's much disagreement over this. This means the OALD isn't the right point of comparison. We're rather trying to create something like the OED for the English-language entries and the Hans Wehr dictionary for Arabic language entries (this is the best dictionary of Modern Standard Arabic I can think of), and similarly for other foreign-language entries.  [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 21:25, 9 August 2015 (UTC)

::[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]]. Neither OALD nor OED cover topics in detail we do here. Published Russian dictionaries lack transliterations, there's nothing to compare with. Well-known dictionaries are unconcerned about the Russian transliteration, they simply don't do it. When they do (in citations, etc.), you get both "narodno'''v'''o" (phonetic) and "narodno'''g'''o" (graphic) transliterations (genitive or animate accusative of {{m|ru|наро́дный}}). You made negative comments about word stresses and genders as well but most users and editors find them useful, AFAIK. Therefore, I have to use other languages again as examples, for the umptieth time.
::Examples of irregular pronunciations and transliterations, using very common words in various scripts:
:* Thai: {{l|th|ชาติ|tr=châat}} (written as "châa-dti") but the final "i" is silent. Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "châa-dti" or similar, with a transliterated "i"?
:* Korean: {{l|ko|십육|tr=simnyuk}} (written as "sibyuk"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "sibyuk" or similar?
:* Japanese: {{l|ja|今日は|tr=こんにちは, konnichi wa}} (written as "konnichi ha"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "konnichi ha" or similar?
:* Arabic: {{l|ar|شُوكُولَاتَة|tr=šokolāta}} (written as "šūkūlāta"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "šūkūlāta" or similar? Perhaps a better example is {{l|ar|إِنْجْلِيزِيّ|tr=ʾinglīziyy}} written as "ʾinjlīziyy".
:: I can give more examples where phonetic transliteration (closer to pronunciation) is considered standard and scientific.

I was merely pointing it out as an example of ''scientifically rigorous'' vs ''convenient''. The issue at hand are the usage examples. When you are giving a quote from Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin'', I want it do be without stress marks and in pre-reform orthography, as it was published [http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=8967 in 1833].

* Adding stress marks to attesting quotations of Russian prose is a poor practice, IMHO. Adding these to headword lines is acceptable; adding these to lists of terms such as synonyms and derived terms is equally poor, IMHO. In most places, terms should be presented in the form in which they appear in print. I don't believe the learners of Russian should be reminded on every single occassion how to pronounce; the headword line itself should suffice. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:40, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
*: I agree with Dan in principle. Language learners are smart enough to click the link if they forgot the stress or pronunciation of a word. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:59, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
::As a (admittedly not very committed) learner of Russian, I would find more pervasive usage of stress marks very useful. Looking up the stress every time is very tedious and a drag on learning. Seeing the stress mark in quotes, examples, links and synonyms would make learning faster through repetition and reinforcement. --[[User:Tweenk|Tweenk]] ([[User talk:Tweenk|talk]]) 22:48, 26 August 2015 (UTC)

== Tagging unsourced reconstructed entries ==
I've just made {{temp|needsources}} to tag reconstructed entries (protoforms) that were created without explicit published sources. Since, after all, reconstructed forms are simply hypotheses, not attested words, they need sources (who proposed that reconstruction, in what publication, and based on which cognates) just as much as a "normal" word needs usage examples so we know it really exists. I therefore suggest that any reconstructed entries that have no sources in them be tagged, so that those interested in them can add the sources. (I started doing this, but my edits were reverted since the issue had not been discussed here first, so I am doing this now.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 01:40, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
: I don't understand why they must absolutely have sources. From its conception, Wiktionary has been a dictionary and therefore stands on par with other dictionaries. Other dictionaries do not source all their definitions to another linguistic work; they interpret and present their research independently. In the same way, Wiktionary and its editors have directly interpreted evidence in the form of attestations. Parroting other dictionaries has always been explicitly forbidden and independent research of lexicographic content has been a requirement, enshrined in [[WT:CFI]] and the process of [[WT:RFV]]. For lexicographical content, we have never once required corroboration by an outside source; we require evidence and make our own decisions based on that through consensus and peer review.
: Because Wiktionary presents etymological information as well, it's also an etymological dictionary. That means that other etymological dictionaries stand on par with Wiktionary. Etymological dictionaries, too, present independent and sometimes novel interpretation of the evidence, and are not required to take all of their contents from other linguistic sources. Of course, when information is corroborated by another source, they can and do indicate this, to strengthen their own claims. But etymological works may equally question or refute what other sources say; they're not limited to parroting others.
: Wikipedia is an encylopedia, a compendium of existing knowledge. This makes sourcing vital to Wikipedia, and original research a problem. But as I have shown here, Wiktionary is of a very different nature, and through this nature it is bound by different rules. It's not a compendium of lexicographic or etymologic knowledge presented by others; it's an independent source of this knowledge. We are not subservient to other linguistic sources, we are their equivalents, or even competitors. Original research within Wiktionary is important, it's an integral part of how Wiktionary works and has always worked. Therefore, it's not appropriate to require sourcing to another linguistic work for information presented on Wiktionary. This goes directly against what Wiktionary is, and the principles and processes written down in our policies. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:09, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Contrary to the above, requiring references for etymologies is not against en wikt policies since we do not have any on the matter. [[WT:ATTEST]], the important evidence-based criterion, says nothing about etymologies. Some people are even pushing a requirement that etymologies should be referenced into [[WT:ETY]]; my removal ({{diff|32447868}}) of an undiscussed addition of such a requirement was undone. I think the whole section References in WT:ETY should be removed as not traceable to a discussion or vote showing consensus, but I have better things to do at this point; maybe a couple of months later. Again, while for definitions we have [[WT:ATTEST]] and [[WT:CFI]] in general, for etymologies we have a policy vacuum. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:10, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:::Let's see if I can help CodeCat understand why sources for etymologies are a good thing:
:::'''(a)''' Etymologies are '''hypotheses''', not '''the truth'''; the interested reader should be able to see why a certain etymology is given here rather than others, without havaing to trace some discussion of its correctness somewhere in the archives.
:::'''(b)''' Etymologies, being '''hypotheses''', have authors: unlike words, they aren't simply "in usage" or "out of usage" or "dated" and whatnot, they were actually ideas, good or bad, proposed by someone. To omit this information is (a1) a disservice to the interested reader, since it hides available information, and (a2) unethical, since it amounts to not giving credit to an author for his/her idea, which is a kind of intellectual theft
:::'''(c)''' To the non-specialist, more information is better than less information. I am sure that a specialist can probably quickly assess and evaluate the goodness of a specific etymology, but others would need more than that. Claiming you don't need this information because "expert Wiktionaries" can access the correctness of an etymology anyway is like claiming that attestations are not necessary to qualify a word for inclusion because "expert Wiktionarians" can tell if a very rare or dialectal word actually exists...
:::'''(d)''' "Other dictionaries don't do that" is not a good argument ("Wiki is not paper", etc.). Some do: etymological dictionaries, where the sources are so important they are usually listed at the beginning of the book rather than at the end, because the author knows that the interested reader will want to form his/her opinion on the author's choice of sources. Non-etymological dictionaries indeed often don't, but they also often don't cite any etymologies at all, and they certainly don't have appendices with reconstructed protoforms -- if we want to follow them, then we should delete all reconstructed entries, shouldn't we?
:::'''(e)''' "Etymological dictionaries present independent and novel interpretations of the evidence" -- indeed, ''and they always label it as such''! And they also ''always give sources for ideas that are not "independent and novel"''! Why should Wiktionary be any different? Personally, I am not against independent research, as long as it is (e1) labeled as such, and (e2) argued for, preferably on the same page. Why are you not doing that? Īn other words: Etymological dictionaries <u>do distinguish original ideas from other people's ideas, which they give sources for; why don't we -- why don't YOU -- do the same?</u>
:::'''(f)''' Mentioning sources '''is not equivalent''' to parroting other dictionaries' definitions--quite the opposite! Mentioning sources means ''respecting'' other people's intellectual property rights, and also giving the reader the possibility of exploring the basis for a given etymology being used here. 
:::Besides, both [[Wiktionary:Reconstructed_terms#References_and_verifiability]] and [[Wiktionary:Etymology#References]] mention the need for sources in etymologies. Why shouldn't we follow these guidelines?
::: '''{{reply to|CodeCat}}''', you seem to believe that sources vs. lack of sources boils down to Wikipedia vs. Wiktionary. It doesn't. The reason for writing adding sources to etymologies is that it ''is'' a good idea (see above), not a simple imitation of other wiki projects. Please get off the soapbox!... Also, it's not a question -- at least not to me -- of "original research". As I said elsewhere, I have nothing in principlpe against original research; I just want it to be labeled as such. If the reconstructed protoforms you created entries for are all your own work, then '''they should be labeled as such''', and your reasons for creating them with that form should be on their page (or on a page like [[WK:About_Proto-Indo-European]], or [[WK:About_Proto-Balto-Slavic]], etc.). I'm not "requiring sourcing ''to another linguistic work''", I'm just "requiring ''sourcing''"-- if it's your work, say so on the page! That's what etymological dictionaries do: they label their own work as such. It's also not about "criteria for inlcusion or deletion": I'm not saying 'delete it if it's original research', I'm saying 'label and argue for it if it's your work' -- not just in obscure discussions two years ago in the Scriptorium, but right on the reconstructed entry page! WHY THE HELL NOT? Something I really don't understand is why you are hellbent on obscuring the reasons why a certain protoform is included here. In what way does hiding the reasons/sources for including a form help Wiktionary become better? Claiming that "expert Wiktionaries" can judge it so we don't need to argue for them on their page is like claiming that "Expert Wiktionaries" can tell if, say, Arabic usage examples are correct or not, so we don't need to translate them into English on the page of the word they are an example for...--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:05, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: (a) Sourcing doesn't actually tell the readers any reasoning. It just suggests that the reasoning might be found in another work instead, but even that's no guarantee as plenty of other works just give forms without any arguments. I am completely for reasoning and giving arguments for reconstructions, within reason. Some widely known and accepted sound changes like Grimm's law should not need to be pointed out in every etymology. So I'm not sure how this point is relevant. External sourcing doesn't change anything about it. If anything, I understand your argument to mean that we should provide argumentation for etymologies in addition to, and regardless of, sourcing.
:::: (b) It can be assumed that all information on Wiktionary is the result of Wiktionary's own editorial process. All content on a wiki is already sourced through the page history, so that gives credit to everything users have ever added to pages. Adding references to Wiktionary users only complicates things. External sources are fine, but we should not be required to tag everything we add with our own usernames, that's just stupid.
:::: (c) Again, a source provides no information, it merely says where information came from. We use many specialised linguistic works as sources on Wiktionary, and I don't think many Wiktionary readers will have access to them. So to the majority of readers, the source is nothing more than a name.
:::: (d) I have nothing against providing a reference to a source when information is taken from them. I admit I have been rather sloppy about this, and still am to some degree. But I am trying to improve things, as you may have noticed from my recent edits to PIE root pages. Do as I say not as I do. Just because I'm not perfect doesn't mean I'm not right.
:::: (e) Again, I have nothing against sourcing information that ''does'' come from an external source. What I disagree with is requiring that all information comes from an external source; this is what your new template's wording appears to imply. I also disagree with sourcing particular ideas to individual editors. Wiktionary is a wiki, and information can and should be edited and improved by other editors. This means it's not right to place certain parts of pages on "lockdown", not allowing anyone else to edit them. Etymological information originating from within Wiktionary should be sourced to Wiktionary editors as a whole, and to editorial consensus. But since ''all'' information not sourced to external sources can be assumed to have been provided by Wiktionary editors, this is entirely redundant.
:::: (f) Copyright doesn't apply and never has applied to information alone. So intellectual property is not relevant here. Scientists give each other credit and require it from others, because of plagiarism, but that's not intellectual property as far as I know. And I have no idea what the laws and rules are on plagiarism anyway. Wiktionary doesn't have any rules for it.
:::: Those two pages you mentioned were written long ago, long before there was really any significant number of reconstructed pages. I also doubt whether they actually reflect consensus and common practice, so they should be changed to reflect what we actually do. My objections to your proposals, now and before, are that we should not be required to have an external source for all etymological information on Wiktionary. This is where my comparison with Wikipedia comes in. Wikipedia has a simple rule: unsourced material that is challenge can and should be removed. I object to bringing this practice to Wiktionary, as we are a dictionary (lexicographical, etymological and other) and it is in the nature of this project to be able to interpret, research and peer review available evidence (attested words) on our own.
:::: So, again, to recap: I have nothing against sourcing. If information comes from somewhere else, source it. That's a good thing. Explaining reasoning for particular reconstructions, in the entries themselves, is also a good thing. I have no problem against that either, but within reason. Very obvious things like Grimm's law probably don't need to be mentioned, but there is no objective standard for this and if we want to go this route, we should figure out among ourselves which information is obvious enough to leave out. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:39, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

:{{reply to|CodeCat}},
::'''(a)''': Of course, only if you mention bad sources. Good sources do have the reasoning behind the proposals. It's up to you if you cite good sources or bad sources. Don't cite bad ones; cite good ones. If you see bad sources being cited, mention that to the author or start a discussion about that source. Don't just omit it -- as always, <u>there is nothing to be gained by using a source -- including your own original research -- and not mentioning it</u>. How many etymological dictionaries do you know that fail to mention their sources? And they are not Wikipedia... Now, it would indeed be better if you added the entire reasoning behind a suggestion rather than just reference the source, but the latter is easier and is the standard practice in etymological dictionaries. And most reconstructed entries here -- especially the ones you made -- still lack such an explanation, which is why they should be tagged with {{template|needsources}}.
::'''(b)''': Sure. But as others have said there is no policy with respect to etymologies and their sources, so saying "it's the result of Wiktionary editorial process" still tells us nothing about what was done. What if I want to know the reasons? Where do I find this information -- an information that most etymological dictionaries give by means of, among other things, indicating their sources? And by giving detailed reasonings when it's their own idea?
::'''(c)''': A good source '''does''' provide information. Are you familiar with good etymological dictionaries? They provide further sources, so you can trace it down to the original proposer, and they provide rationales for deviant forms. They also compare different hypotheses, and often provide further evidence for preferring one or the other. Plus they list correspondences and sound laws, especially the least known ones. They're full of argumentation, reasonings, rationales... What the heck are you talking about? What sources are you talking about?
::'''(d)''': Good! Please continue doing that. If you add sources to your pages I have problems with them. In fact that is my entire point: not having sources and reasons for including a particular protoform on the page itself is '''not''' a plus for Wiktionary, it's actually, as you put it, being sloppy. I'm glad you're fixing that, and you'll get my support for this. The goal, of course, should be to fix everything.
::'''(e)''': And here we are apparently in full agreement: I am in favor of referencing external sources only when the information comes from an external source (duh!...). But now, "if" a given word is the result of your own original research, then this should be sourced, so that the reader knows that it is your original research. If you have your reasoning on the page, what the heck is bad about saying it is your idea? In what way is that bad for Wiktionary? And again, good etymological dictionaries do that (Karulis adds a big "K" to every paragraph in the LEV that contains his own ideas, for instance. That is what good etymological dictonaries do: they do not shy away from original research, but they label it as such and argue for it on the entry itself! Why is that so bad?) 
::'''(f)''': Intellectual property is not simply a question of law; it's a question of ethics. "Plagiarism", i.e. people taking advantage of other people's ideas without mentioning them, is exactly what the concept of intellectual property is supposed to prevent; why else do you think it exists? I think scientists don't own the legal copyright over their own ideas after they're published, but they certainly have the moral/ethical copytright. Do you think Dr Kim would be happy if you wrote him an e-mail telling himv you've mentioned Proto-Balto-Slavic protoforms he proposed in a public forum like Wiktionary ''without'' mentioning his name? Would you, if you were in his place? Maybe he thinks Wiktionary is "just internet" or "not trustworthy" and thus not worth the trouble, but I'm sure he wouldn't think that not mentioning his name is the right thing to do -- in fact, I'll bet he would mention this as an argument ''against'' taking Wiktionary seriously. Which in fact it is.
::'''(g)''': Maybe the pages should indeed be changed; two other Wiktionarians in the rfd discussion have already suggested that I myself "be bold" and edit and change them. I don't want to do that, though; but if you feel so strongly about it, why don't you? I do point out, though, that several others have said there is no official policy, so I'm not sure that there is a "what we do" yet: you seem to be placing the cart before the horses here. I think you still need to argue for "what YOU do" as being "what we should do". And frankly, I don't see how you can argue that not mentioning sources actually enhances Wiktionary. There is no self-respecting etymological dictionary that doesn't mention sources and doesn't label independent original research as such; why should Wiktionary?
::'''In sum''', if you don't have anything against sourcing, then remove the {{temp|rfd}} from a template that merely asks for what you say you have nothing against. If you are in favor of explaining reasons for particular reconstructions in the entries themselves, then do so. In fact create a framework for doing that, with a special page in the Wiktionary namespace for listing all correspondences, all sound laws, etc. so you can easily refer to them in the shorter explanations in every reconstructed entry. By all means ''do'' so! The problem thus far is that this is not being done, and when I started requesting that it be done ("source" = "published source" OR "original research rationale") you reverted all my changes and asked for my template to be deleted. Be consistent! Do as you claim to believe! --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:34, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:{{reply to|CodeCat}}, to summarize:
::It seems we agree in most things. We both think it's good to have sources if the information comes from an external source. We both think original research is OK, and we're both in favor of writing down the reasons for a certain reconstruction in the entry itself. I'm further in favor of you also mentioning yourself as the author of a given idea if indeed that is the case, or at least of referencing/copying the discussion that led to a given form being accepted here. So why not do it? And what is the problem with tagging the entries where this wasn't done yet? I also add {{temp|rfap}} to basically every new Latvian entry I make, because this puts them in a single category where Latvian native speakers like Neitrāls vārds can comfortably find the words they want to add pronunciation files to. Because, just as in the case of etymologies being sourced (and I don't mean only external sources), this actually adds value to the entry.

:I don't accept the notion that we need to cite sources to list descendants; that would hobble us. Regular inheritance by a language of a word from an earlier stage of that language (including from a proto-language) is usually so obvious and non-noteworthy that it is not mentioned except for common words in well-documented languages, or for proto-language terms that an author needs to grasp at less-documented languages to demonstrate; [[good luck]] finding a reference that confirms, for any sizeable number of words from e.g. Rumantsch, that they indeed derive from Latin/PIE ''foobar''. Even borrowing may be obvious but unreferenced; no reference in {{m|en|supra}} confirms that the word derives from Georgian, but it's fairly obvious. <br />I do think the sheer ''existence'' of a word in a proto-language is something we need to provide a reference for, though if a reference attests that a certain word existed in a proto-language, I think we can and should certainly adapt that reference's potentially outdated notation; when I do this in Proto-Algonquian appendices I write <samp>source (has ''form'')</samp> (sometimes visibly and sometimes in an HTML comment). If no previous scholarship attests the existence of a word, we could put a template at the bottom of the entry (a bit like {{temp|LDL}} and {{temp|Webster}}) saying something like "this reconstruction is the product of deduction by Wiktionary editors"; users could then (as with every other claim on every non-talk-page) look to the page history to see who added what. Such a template would provide a nice way of tracking and periodically revisiting such entries to see if references for them had become available, since it seems to be obvious to everyone except CodeCat that citing external authority [[wrt]] the existence of words in proto-languages is better than leaving it at "well, a random, vehemently anonymous person on the internet thinks so". [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:15, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:: {{reply to|-sche}} the problem here is simply when you have cognates proposed by different sources. Cognates can be sourced by default (they will mostly come from the same source anyway), without necessarily adding a footnote to each of them; but those who come from some other source will need to be footnoted, so that we are clear the source in question did not claim cognacy in this case. This applies even to words suggested as cognate by Wiktionarians: we could add a little superscript "W" to those, for example. This happens because "obvious" is not always true. French {{m|fr|parler}} looks like a cognate of Portuguese {{m|pt|falar}}, but it isn't. In fact, it's standard scientific practice: when you are presenting cognates, they must be either (a) sourced, or (b) your claim, or at least (c) be attested in some very well-known source, so they can be presented as "known to everybody already".--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:48, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I'm still being misunderstood here it seems. I do think that citing an external authority improves etymologies and reconstructions further. However, I don't think that reconstructions are necessarily less reliable without them. Sometimes, the reconstruction is just so obvious that there's nothing else it could possibly be. A great example is Proto-Finnic {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}}. It's exactly the same form as its ancestor and many of its descendants. If we can find sources that agree with our own ideas, then all the better, that just shows that we're not alone in thinking that. But the same applies to sources with respect to each other, too. If we have two sources that disagree with each other, then we can mention the idea from both of them. But we should also feel free to poke holes in these proposals. Maybe we (through [[WT:ES]] or a talk) could decide that one of them has more merit than the other, and we can mention our reasoning in the entry. As editors and researchers, we don't have to consider all sources equally valid. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:28, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
::: I think the misunderstanding is actually yours, about how science works. Yes, {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}} is maybe an obvious case, but it was not discovered by you or me. It has a proposer, and saying who it is is, I think, something an etymologist would be interested in. See, this is like saying we don't have to provide usage examples or definitions for words that "everybody knows". Yes, everybody knows what [[time]] and [[happy]] mean; yet Witkionary provides them with definitions. Is this useless? No. Is it useless to provide a source for {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}}? Again, no. Just ask any scientist: is it useless to provide sources for 'obvious' things? No, both for credit/historical reasons (the guy who said it first deserves the credit), and for scientific reasons ('obvious' ideas sometimes turn out to be wrong...).  If the source is well-known ('everybody knows who proposed that'), then scientists will not mention the author (everybody knows the laws of gravitation were proposed by Sir Isaac Newton).
:::: Looking for "the proposer of" obvious etymologies is not a good idea. Finnic is a dialect continuum, and it has ''always'' been known by the speakers that people in nearby areas use plenty of the same words. This would be sort of like asking "who was it that proposed that ''fish'' in British English and ''fish'' in American English are cognate?" (Or: "who was it to discover that the moon has phases?")
:::: It's possible to do historiography on when does an etymology like this start turning up in scientific literature of course, but that's more constrained by the development of linguistic methodology and publication practices themself. {{temp|R:fi:SSA}} mentions appearences of ''kala'' spanning 350 years; the earliest inter-Finnic comparison found by them is Finnish ~ Estonian from 1786, followed by Karelian in 1799, Veps in 1830 (in the first linguistic report on Veps to be published), Votic in 1856 (in the first grammar of Votic to be written), etc. (There's no specific date on who was the first to claim that this is also a Proto-Finnic word; but if we grant modern theoretic understanding, this is already implied by the Finnish-Hungarian comparisons from the 17th century, so essentially the date would be as soon as someone came up with the concept of "Proto-Finnic" in the first place.)
:::: I agree that this is information that someone ''might'' be interested in, but just referencing SSA itself should be enough so that people interested in the history of etymology would know where to look for more details. At Wiktionary we're only working on etymology ''itself'', not its history. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 13:47, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Indeed, I agree, especially because a source like SSA would probably give you the beginning of the trail leading to the first proponent if need be. I'm not saying that you need to find out the very first historical source ever to make the claim; but that, unless the claim is yours, some source should be indicated (so the interested reader can follow the trail). And it seems that we agree on that, right? (The "fish" in AE and BE case is not really parallel: I don't think these words were popularly believed to be cognates, but rather they were believed to be the same word, much as when I use "fish" as opposed to when you use "fish": we are using the same words, even if we pronounce them differently. Now, English "fish" and German "Fisch" or Dutch "vis": that is not perceived as the 'same word', and cognacy enters the picture.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:20, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

From the above discussion, it seems to me that most people want to keep the automatic transliteration of non-latin-script examples.

Light grey text is hard for people with bad or limited eyesight (e.g. partial blindness) to read, although such people are probably only a tiny minority of our readers. I'd prefer parentheses to lighter text. I like the suggestion (made above) of putting transliteration on the same vs a different line according to the length of the line, but I guess it has no chance of actually corresponding to "fits on one line" vs "doesn't", given the variety of phone- and computer-screen sizes (unless we implement it is a css feature?).

== When adding RFC to entries ==

Would it be too much to ask whether when an RFC is added to an entry that the date be added as well (perhaps automatically), so that it can be traced back much more easily in the RFC records. Some RFCs remain in entries for years and get forgotten about, and are not easily traceable in the entry's history. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 16:00, 9 August 2015 (UTC)

:Wikipedia has a bot that goes around adding dates to cleanup templates. Perhaps we could ask the folks who run it to run one here, too. You can find always the RFC discussion via the whatlinkshere (restrict it to searching the Wiktionary namespace and ctrl-f "cleanup"), unless the page was tagged but not listed. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 01:59, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

:::We already have the capability to deploy "oldest" and "newest" tables (such as the "oldest" table at the top of this page) for categories, which addresses on of your concerns.

== Templatizing usage examples ==

FYI, I created [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-08/Templatizing usage examples]]. Let us discuss the proposal, and postpone the start of the vote as much as the discussion requires. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:38, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
:I support this and I don't see why anyone wouldn't. It's analogous to why we templatize headwords and such. Templatized foreign-script languages, for example, allow for automatic translit. And likewise, the format can be changed, either by the end user through CSS or by editing the template -- e.g. if we figure out how to automatically use CSS to decide whether to put such an example on one line or multiple lines, which should definitely be doable since things like Bootstrap (a CSS library released by Twitter) can do it. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 01:39, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

:::: I too oppose votes on matters of formatting and template usage (and have stated as much in the past). Such votes could be seen as, at best, pointless, or as disruptive attempts to block the implementation of relatively minor changes by requiring the changes undergo more hurdles and meet a higher threshold (compare how US congresspeople use the filibuster to raise the threshold for passing legislation from 51% to 60%, blocking legislation which has enough votes to pass but not enough votes to come to the floor). Once before I started an "oppose having this vote" section on a vote, which garnered as much support as the vote itself; one could consider such an action if this vote is opened. (Side note, all the examples in the vote are English usexes, but I think it may be wise to consider English usexes — which don't need transliteration or translation — differently from foreign-language usexes.)

I find the above implication that editors at large should not have a consensus-based say in matters of template use in the mainspace and formatting in mainspace disconcerting. The wiki and template markup is the user interface and it matters a lot. The formatting instructions [[WT:ELE]] are a policy and cannot, in most circumstances, be edited without a vote. I oppose the use of ux and usex templates in English and Czech entries; it adds almost no value and makes the markup ugly to read. I never said so since I did not have the energy to do so; there are usually all to many things to discuss, in part since there are too many unnecessary changes being introduced by various editors without discussion. I have finally lost my patience, after seeing an editor chastise another editor for ''not'' using these templates. If I am a lone voice, the vote will easily pass. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:03, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

:::I asked not about the generalized benefits of templates, but of ''this'' one. I was hoping there were more. 
:::So the total benefit is in the statement "the format can be changed, <u>either by the end user through CSS</u> or <u>by editing the template</u> -- e.g. if we figure out how to automatically use CSS to decide whether to put such an example on one line or multiple lines"

:::# Generally it seems that the features of templates quickly become Luacized, which dramatically reduces the ability of more casual contributors like me to make changes, especially since there is no group of responsive technical contributors willing to respond to requests, rather than implement their own cryptic agendas.
:::# All benefit depends on either: 
:::## total implementation of a very capable (ergo, hard to develop successfully) template or 
:::## allowing user-option non-use of the template when it fails to provide good output by the person using the template, ie, some who knew or was willing to learn the switches etc.

Some people recently mentioned they missed [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-03/CFI: Removing usage in a well-known work 3]], despite the fact that the vote was opened for 5 months.

== Rare senses x rare forms ==

I have noticed that the parameter "rare" of the {{template|template:context}} categorizes entries into the [[:Category:Terms with rare senses by language]], while the parameter "uncommon" into the [[:Category:Rare forms by language]]. What is the difference between these two categories? Originally I thought that "rare forms" contains only forms of some lemma, which are rare (e. g. common Czech word "{{m|cs|pes||dog}}" has a common plural "psi", but rarely "psové" can be found too), but the real content of the category does not look so. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 00:19, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

:The fact that various rare, historical, dated, archaic{{,}} and obsolete things are categorized differently is due to (1) a desire to categorize terms with only obsolete/rare senses (like {{m|en|heleth}}) differently from terms which are still current/common in some senses (like {{m|en|land}}), combined with (2) the fact that categorizing such entries differently requires a lot of work (edits to entries, templates, etc), most of which has not been done yet. I think the ideal/plan/hope is that one day terms like {{m|en|heleth}} will be in [[:Category:English obsolete terms]] (I am not sure why [[:Category:English obsolete forms]] exists with the name and content it has; as you note, it should properly be used only for e.g. {{m|en|low}} as a form of {{m|en|laugh}}), while {{m|en|land}} et al will be in [[:Category:English terms with obsolete senses]].

== Retiring the codes of spurious languages ==

As of this year, the ISO has retired or has received requests to retire the following codes on the grounds that they are spurious and the languages they ostensibly refer to never existed. I suggest we also retire the codes.
# ''cbh'' Cagua, ''kox'' Coxima, ''cum'' Cumeral, ''ome'' Omejes, ''toe'' Tomedes, ''rna'' Runa. I quote from the change request forms ([//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-034.pdf cbh], [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-035.pdf kox], [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-030.pdf cum], [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-031.pdf ome], [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-033.pdf toe]): "Alan Wares, in correspondence with Barbara Grimes (5/28/1971), stated that [each one] should be deleted as 'non-existent.' Moreover, the Ethnologue has not added any information to the language entry in nearly 40 years. Mention of this language is missing from all the major sources on South American languages (Adelaar 2004, Campbell 1997, Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Loukotka 1968, Crevels 2007, Voegelin & Voegelin 1977).

([//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-023.pdf rna]'s change request is similarly blunt about the total lack of evidence that it exists.)

Hammarstrom (2014, in press) cites two additional sources (Landaburu 2000, Ortiz 1965) for the non-attestation of Chipiajes." The comments on ''[//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-032.pdf pod]'' are similar.
# ''xbx'' Kabixí. See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-026.pdf the change request form], where it is noted that the term Kabixí is a catch-all for any hostile tribe, and the linguist who studied it "concedes that there was no information on" it.
# ''iap'' Iapama. Quoth [http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-037.pdf ]: "There is no evidence that this language exists.  No information has been added to the Ethnologue since the 1980s.

Hammarstrom (2014, in press) cites two additional sources (Grenand & Grenand 1994, Gallois & Ricardo 1983) for the non-attestation of Iapama."
# ''svr'' Savara. Quoth [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-010.pdf ]: "Hammarstrom (2014, in press) states that it has been checked quite carefully that no Dravidian language exists matching the name Savara or any of the other information in the entry (p.c. David Stampe 2011) , nor, for that matter, the Indo-Aryan Oriya variety labeled Sahara/Saora in Mahapatra (2002:183-184). Barb Waugh, in an email dated 10 November 2009, responded to queries about Savara stating that she did not believe that the language existed at all.  She only knew Savara as an alternate name for Sora [srb], a Munda language. She pointed out that Ruhlen (1987) lists Savara as a Dravidian language.  Around the same time, Kirk Miller (UCSB) wrote questioning the existence of this language."
# <s>''yds'' Yiddish Sign Language. See [//www.jewish-languages.org/yiddish-sign-language.html jewish-languages.org's entry] for more.</s> [has been removed from Wiktionary]
# ''btl'' Bhatola. See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-047.pdf ].
# ''myi'' Mina (India). See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-048.pdf ]. Neatly, retiring this will allow us to include ''hna'' Mina (Cameroon) without a disambiguator.
# ''pry'' Pray (aka "Pray 3", as Ethnologue called it because they just gave up on disambiguating it in any of their usual ways). This one is not strictly spurious; rather, it turns out to be no more than a duplicate of ''prt'' Prai (aka Pray). See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-045.pdf the  change request form with data from recent field research].
# <s>''yos'' "Yos" was retired and merged it into ''zom'' "Zo", with [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2012-035.pdf the change request] noting that Yos is simply the English plural of Yo which is no more than a variant form of Zo.</s> [has been removed from Wiktionary]

== About gloss parameter in term templates in all other sections, except etymology ==

I am not sure how helpful is a gloss in Derived and Related terms or even in Synonyms.
A term, as all words, may have many different senses. These can include a figurative one, a literal one etc.
The existence of a gloss definition in etymology section is usefull since possibly (but not always) only one sense is the specific one that "caused" the people to use the word (or phoneme). 
I came to these conclusions after {{ping|Saltmarsh}} [[User_talk:Xoristzatziki#RelatedDerived terms|pointed out]] that I should add some gloss definitions to my additions. I tried it for start, but there where some "mind" troubles when I had to add terms that have more than one wide used sense or more than one gender. Someone might say that in such cases do not add a gloss. But even if only one sense is wide used we "provoke" the rejection of all other senses that user may find in the article. --[[User:Xoristzatziki|Xoristzatziki]] ([[User talk:Xoristzatziki|talk]]) 06:05, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
:Synonyms should use {{temp|sense}}. Derived and related terms should specify a gloss but it can be of the form {{para|gloss|foo, bar, baz}} with multiple defns; doesn't have to be all possible senses but should be the principal ones. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:45, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::[I've been away] &nbsp; '''Reasoning''':  the gloss may be interesting/relevant and having it there saves the user linking through to find out. User [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] shows the syntax. &nbsp; '''Gender''': I think I would do this for multiple gender forms of different meaning:
::*{{l|el|φοοβάρος|gloss=foobar|g=m}}, {{l|el|φοοβάρος|gloss=cadscab|g=n}}<br>
::'''Idiomatic phrases''': I would normally link each term (do we want all of these with a separate entry) and these certainly need a gloss.&nbsp; &mdash; <span style="color:#1e90ff">[[User:Saltmarsh|Saltmarsh]]</span><sup><span style="color:#ff1493">[[User_talk:Saltmarsh|συζήτηση-talk]]</span></sup> 05:57, 15 August 2015 (UTC)
* Synonyms and Derived terms sections should not specify a gloss, by my lights. It is not only my preference but also a long-term overwhelming practice not to specify a gloss. Some people prefer glosses, obviously, but it is nowhere close to being a prescribed or recommended practice. Similarly, these sections should not provide gender, IMHO, but here the practice varies language by language. As for rationale, glosses make these sections too busy with information that is available elsewhere. Gender is okay as for being too busy or not, but is available in the lemma, and IMHO not so important that it should be available in term lists. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 17:42, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

== Allow Etymology as level 4 header ==

Me and some others (I don't know who, or where the discussion was) have expressed in the past a desire to have the etymology section nested under part-of-speech sections, rather than floating alongside them (both on level 3) or having the part of speech nested under the etymology. I think it makes more sense to put etymology underneath an individual word:

# Users generally look up terms for their definitions, etymology is of lesser importance overall. Therefore, it makes more sense to put it below the definitions.
# Etymology always applies to a single word and part of speech. If it happens to apply to multiple parts of speech, then the chances are that one of them was first, and the others were derived from that. That's something we can and should note in the etymologies of each individual part of speech.
# Having to increase the heading level whenever there are multiple etymologies is annoying. It also makes it look less consistent; sometimes POS is level 3, sometimes level 4? Level 5 headings are hard to distinguish visually from level 4, so I think level 4 should be the highest level we use.
# For non-lemma entries, we generally don't have or need etymologies, but we're forced to create etymology sections for them whenever there is another word in the entry. For example, {{m|en|rose|gloss=rise|pos=past}} needs an etymology header to separate it from the header for {{m|en|rose||flower}}, but the etymology section itself is left empty or doesn't have any useful information, because the etymology is at the lemma, {{m|en|rise}}.

So I'd like to ask/propose that etymologies be allowed to be nested underneath the POS header, as level 4. It would be added below the definitions, usage notes and inflection headers, but above synonyms, antonyms and derived/related terms. This is done in accordance with the general principle in our entry layout that information about the current term precedes information about relationships to other terms.

This proposal is intended as an indefinite trial, to let users who prefer this alternative format apply it to entries and evaluate its merits and problems. The original format will continue to be allowed as well, at least until there is a decision to phase it out. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:50, 12 August 2015 (UTC)

: "If it happens to apply to multiple parts of speech" -- isn't that overwhelmingly common? It would be tiresome to have ety sections repeated all over the place when they are basically the same word/sense. Do other dicts do that? [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 18:54, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I've not found it particularly common in the languages I've worked with, it's quite rare. Maybe English is just an exception. But this is why I'm not proposing to get rid of the old format just yet; we can still keep using it in situations that we haven't found alternatives for yet. That said, I think it's pretty easy to handle this with nested etymologies, as I noted in point 2. Just put the etymology on the term that was first, and the rest get etymologies saying they were derived from that first term. For example, {{m|en|up|pos=preposition}} is derived from {{m|en|up|pos=adverb}}, which our entry fails to note. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:01, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::: For many words, it might not be known which POS came first. Other dictionaries do not do this. They generally list all the parts of speech and give one etymology at the top or bottom of the entry (which sometimes mentions different derivations of specific senses of the word, is still in one section). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:12, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::::"English is <u>just</u> an exception."  And also merely, technically the host language of this wiki.
::::No matter how many times this is proposed, it still seems like a bad idea. The structuring advantage of having semantically related terms that are different PoSes is enormous for English. Though it is not particularly helpful for one not familiar with large dictionaries, it is quite helpful once one get the hang of it. It is almost essential where there are homonyms both with, say, nouns as PoSes. Is it the proposal to combine all of the noun PoSes, no matter what the etymologies? We have spent a fair amount of effort trying to split etymologies where semantically warranted. To run the definitions through the blender as seems to be proposed seems like a regression. We may have come to accept them in technical areas as people abandon the project and their creations lapse, but I don't see why they should be allowed in content.

:::::::* To clarify my concern about merging POS bits, I'm not talking about nouns and verbs being thrown together.  Instead, I'm concerned about terms that have multiple senses of a single POS type, and where those separate senses have different etymologies.  If the etymology header is made subordinate to POS, then things get confusing pretty quickly.  Consider the Japanese entry at {{m|ja|柄}}, for instance.  This term has nine different noun senses, all with distinct etymologies (and eight distinct pronunciations even).  The proposed structure of an <samp>====Etymology====</samp> header at level 4, under a <samp>===Noun===</samp> header at level 3, would make this entry a complete mess.  ‑‑&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 18:07, 14 August 2015 (UTC)
: See {{diff|34038360}} for an example of how I think etymologies should be handled. Each POS has its own etymology, including (especially) forms of another lemma. Two different lemmas can't possibly have the same etymology, because after all, if they have the same development history, why are they still different?
: As for Eirikr's entry above, I'm not really seeing the issue. The entry already has one etymology section for each POS, so all that would be left to do is to switch the headers around. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:09, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
:* [[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]], have another look.  As visible in the page's TOS, some single etymologies cover multiple POSes -- noun and prefix, noun and suffix.
:: In addition, I still don't quite understand your proposed layout.  Further up the thread, it ''sounds'' like all nouns would go together under a single <samp>===Noun===</samp> header -- which then leaves me wondering how the disparate etymologies would be accounted for.  Even if your intention is to have as many <samp>===Noun===</samp> headers as there are etymologies, this produces a strange circumstance where we are organizing higher-level headers in a way that's dependent on lower-level headers.  Just in terms of hierarchical organization, that seems backwards.
:: And that still doesn't account for the case where an entry has multiple etymologies, and some of those etymologies apply to multiple POSes.  Numerous Japanese terms have a single spelling, with multiple POSes under a single etym and pronunciation.  Fewer, but still numerous, entries have multiple separate etymologies, each etym with its own pronunciation and possibly multiple POSes.
:: Would you be willing to edit the {{m|ja|柄}} entry into your proposed structure, as you did for {{diff|34038360|text=''dice''}}?

* I agree that conlangs should be handled separately from reconstructed terms. In contrast to how we handle proto-languages, our current approach to conlangs actually ''is'' fairly well suited to the appendix namespace, in that we have one page (one appendix, total) on each conlang. '''However''', most of them are constant copyvio magnets, since we can only allow short appendices, but the inclusion of any appendix at all tempts people to expand said appendix: see e.g. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Quenya&action=history] ([[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2014/July#Inclusion_of_Dothraki|BP discussion of copyright issues]]). I wouldn't mind deleting most of them, perhaps moving a few (''de minimis'') words into our mainspace entries on the ''names'' of the conlangs, using {{temp|examples-right}}, like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=L%C3%A1adan&type=revision&diff=33838599&oldid=33838581 this].

* '''Support''' a separate namespace for reconstructed languages (for one, it's the by far busiest part of the Appendix: namespace, and trying to find out whatever is going on with all the ''other'' appendices is a pain). — I do not think that a mainspace-type approach to lumping "homographic" roots from different protolangs on the same page is a good idea though. Notational systems for protolangs vary greatly, and this could imply a senseless amount of repetition of "Alternate spelling of…" sections in the future. The basic object of protolang pages is an ''etymological group'', not the graphical representation of its proto-form, per se.<br/>In fact I could suggest that the new namespace be named simply ''Etymology:'', and that it could include appendix pages tracing the descendants of attested words just as well (a la [[Appendix:Names derived from Marcus]]). --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 14:10, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== Eskayan ==

Last year, the ISO approved the code ''[//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=esy esy]'' for Eskayan. Should we follow suit, and if so, should we allow it in the main namespace? It's technically a conlang from the early 1900s, but it comes with a mythology that claims it's much older and it functions as a medium for recording traditional stories (both in Roman script and in a native script which lacks a ISO 15924 code). It has no native speakers but a few hundred secondary speakers and a few schools to teach it. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:50, 14 August 2015 (UTC)

:I've added it to [[Module:languages]]. It is spoken by a few hundred people, and schools teach it and literature is published in it and has been for almost a century, so I suppose it is allowed in the main namespace like Esperanto. Its creator intended it for widespread use (by his ethnic group) and attributed it to his tribe's mythical ancestor rather than to himself, and then he (the actual creator) died in 1949, so as far as copyright concerns go, it seems similar to e.g. Esperanto and different from e.g. Dothraki. Shall we update [[WT:CFI#Constructed_languages]] to note the existence and inclusion of Eskayan, or is that not necessary because the ISO doesn't categorize ''esy'' as a constructed language, and it does not itself admit that it is one (even though it is identifiable as such by linguists)?

As I see it, a discussion on '''allowing "Notes" as a valid header''' should be considered.

Vahag has brought this up ([[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#.7B.7Breflist.7D.7D]]) and I'm running into a similar problem all the time. As ridiculously silly of an argument as it may be, I do, in fact, agree that numbered and bulleted references together look ugly AF. (I have even went to such ridiculous steps as removing a reference that didn't add anything critical just because it was bulleted while the other ones were numbered because of how unappealing it looks.)

In more general terms, I kind of get the feeling that there seems to be consensus that references are in fact valuable and add value to the entry, perhaps the discussion should focus more on how to allow more elegant ways of faithfully citing content, particularly in "controversial" cases, e.g., obviously one bulleted reference is enough under, say, an assertion that et {{m|et|kala}} and liv {{m|liv|kalā}} derive from the same source because, well, it's pretty obvious but then if there is a "weird" controversial cognate there isn't even a way of citing it inline (unless you want the awful looking mixing of numbered and bulleted refs.)

* '''Oppose'''. The solution to the layout problem is to not use bulleted references. Usage notes already covers any notes relevant to the entry. Anything that would go into a Wikipedia entry's "Notes" section should either be addressed in the appropriate section directly (as with contested etymologies) or simply removed (as with Ungoliant's "[https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=arachnogenic_necrosis&oldid=33965530 a. necrosis]" example). Giving people ''yet another'' section in which to include errata isn't an actual solution to the problems people are listing.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<span style="color:Gold">II</span></span>]] 14:07, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
** IMO this makes little sense. You basically think people should never create references sections listing refs; that's an impossible standard to meet and often way too awkward. In my Arabic entries that I add, I routinely add a "References" section under each part-of-speech entry listing the books where I got the entry definitions from. There's no simpler way of doing it, since the reference really does refer to the POS section as a whole in most cases. And many languages do this. So we really do need Notes and References separate. Likewise if we're using Harvard-Style references, with short footnotes under "Notes" that are linked to a list of references under "References".

*** IMO you're confused as to what's being proposed which probably goes back to the original discussion's misunderstanding of Wikipedia's #Notes section. #Notes (as the name implies) are for actual notes; they are not for references of any sort. #References are for both generated inline references (what's being called numbered references here) and bibliographic lists. If you feel the layout requires it, you can create subsections for #Citations and #Bibliography or #Works cited or #Whathaveyou.<br><br>There's no call whatsoever for a (second) #Notes section at Wiktionary and creating one will ''increase'' the level of errata our users will add to entries, which the editors above felt to be a problem. The [[w:1st rule of holes]] suggests not expanding the areas of the entry devoted to random information, beyond that included in the existing and needful areas.<br><br>As for having a subsection of #References for linked #Citations and another for stand-alone #Works... I fall back on my position that you're just being lazy and should create appropriate references as you create entries. At the same time, there's no real problem with creating ''a subsection within #References'' to deal with the layout issues, if people really want harvard style references and a separate list of works.

*'''Oppose'''. I also oppose the notion (expressed by some above) that all references need to use ref tags. In particular, because Wiktionary has a longstanding practice, which I support, of not cite other dictionaries inline for definitions, but Wiktionary does allow other dictionaries ("mentions") to [[WT:ATTEST|verify]] words in many languages, there will always be many entries which have references which apply to the whole entry, as Benwing notes. I personally don't find a mix of bulleted and numbered citations problematic, but if you do, a solution like the one deployed on [[բալախ]] is preferable to a new section which, I agree with Llywelyn, is unnecessary and also apparently misunderstanding what Wikipedia uses ==Notes== for (hint: not references, but actual clarificatory notes, which often don't cite references). Practically speaking, the continued use of "related terms" by new users to mean "semantically related" when it actually is for "etymologically related", and the only very slight distinction that is proposed to be made between ==References== and ==Notes==, convinces me that only a few veteran adepts would use ==Notes== correctly, and other people would either not use it "correctly" vis-a-vis ==References==, or fill it up with trivia.

== Nouns mostly used in plural - redirection to singular ==

I see reduction of content going on in nouns often used in plural, via soft redirection to singular forms. That includes [[crocodile tears]], [[savings]], and [[scrambled eggs]]. This seems inferior to me and I would like to refert. We should IMHO host the definitions in the most common form, and if the most common form is the plural, we should host it in plural. What do you think? Anyone has a link to a previous discussion? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:10, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

:One concern I expressed in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/August#Template:in_the_plural|this previous discussion]] (see also [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/December#Entries_that_mix_form-of_definitions_and_lemmas|this one]]) was that most people are able to figure out when a word is plural even if they can't tell what it means, and will look up the base form (e.g. ''foobar'', if what they see in the text is "the foobars are blah"), so unless there is some explicit and obvious notice that additional senses are to be found in the plural's entry, readers may never think to look there. <br />If ''all'' senses are most common in the plural, I agree that the plural should be the lemma, with the singular using [[Template:singular of]] or a similar template. If only some senses are most common in the plural, I think it's more helpful to the reader to have them all in one place with appropriate labels (like "chiefly plural"). I could live with splitting them, though, as long as there were explicit, obvious notices to readers that they need to look in the other entry for more senses. (I don't think bare [[Template:singular of]] as an additional definition-line after some substantive definitions makes it sufficiently obvious that there's more ''semantic'' information to be found in the plural, but [[Template:singular of]] with a gloss specified might work.)

:: The way I see it, there is one and only one lemma entry (one with definitions, inflection, -nyms, etc) per lemma. A single lemma should not have more than one lemma entry. So either these should all be concentrated on a single lemma page, as our normal practice is with respect to lemmas and non-lemmas, or we should treat them as separate lemmas entirely and keep them completely separate. I have done this with some entries as well, such as {{m|en|dialectics}} and {{m|en|darts}}. Note that in the former case I made sure to split the etymology as well, as different lemmas always have different etymologies. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:20, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
::: We also need to establish some limit for how much more common the plural is.

== What to call plural noun lemmas? ==

We have the template {{temp|en-plural noun}} to categorise nouns whose lemma is grammatically plural. But this template also categorises in [[:Category:English pluralia tantum]]. Is every noun that is used primarily in the plural a plurale tantum? I'm thinking a better category name would be [[:Category:English plural nouns]] or [[:Category:English plural-only nouns]]. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 14:28, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:Very many "plural only" nouns can be found to be attested in the singular, eg [[scissor]]. It would, IMO, be misleading to eliminate the category for this reason, but it means that we need a good explanation in the category header. If we have a good explanation, we don't need to worry as much about the category name. I think what users need to know is not that the lemma is plural in form, but whether it is more commonly ("correctly") used ("agrees") with a singular or plural verb. I think this is an empirical question for many such terms, rather than something that follows from the categorization. I wonder whether the category shouldn't be hidden and the "plural-only" display replaced with something that focused on the agreement issue. As a hidden category it would retain its usefulness in directing contributors to reviewing the entries to determine whether they adequately and correctly addressed the agreement issue.

::: With such nouns that do have a singular, we have to ask what the singular actually means. For the derivation singular > plural it's easy, it is simply multiple of a thing. For plural > singular, if the plural form clearly does refer to multiple objects, then I'd reason that it should simply be a non-lemma and the singular is the lemma. But for plural nouns that are not clearly multiple instances of something, it's more difficult. "Scissors" is a single object, so a hypothetical singular form doesn't have a predictable meaning. What is a "scissor"? Saying it's the singular of "scissors" doesn't actually make it clear what it is. So I think that we should evaluate cases where the singular parameter of this template has been specified. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:00, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

== Guidance requested on religious terminology ==

'''Quaker terms''' I would like to make entries or a listing for Quaker-related terminology, as some of it is very particular but I'm not sure if it belongs in the main body of the dictionary or an appendix or what-have-you. For instance, Quakers traditionally didn't refer to the days of the week by their common pagan-derived names but used "first day" for Sunday, "second day" for Monday, etc. I could easily imagine someone reading about a "Friend going to meeting-house on first day" and not realizing that this means a "Quaker going to church on Sunday".

== French French, Spanish Spanish and the like ==

This came up [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Category:Spanish_Spanish|tangentially in May]], but I'd like to raise it in its own thread. Currently, most regional categories are named "[place-adjective] [language]", as in "[[:Category:French French|French French]]", "[[:Category:Welsh English|Welsh English]]" and "[[:Category:Austrian German|Austrian German]]", while a minority are named "[place-noun] [language]", as in "[[:Category:Louisiana English|Louisiana English]]" (not *"Louisianan English") and "[[:Category:Quebec French|Quebec French]]". <br /> I and some others find "French French" (and also to some extent "Welsh English") awkward and confusing, because it's easy to interpret both instances of "French" (and "Welsh") as referring to a language rather than a place. The "[place-adjective] [language]" scheme is also impossible or undesirable for some languages: "Swiss German" was felt [by some people, not me] to be so similar to the name of the Swiss German ''language'' [which Wiktionary calls Alemannic] that its category was moved to "[[:Category:Switzerland German|Switzerland German]]", and it's currently impossible to distinguish French terms specific to the [[DRC]] from those specific to the [[ROC]], because both go in "[[:Category:Congolese French|Congolese French]]". OTOH, "Austrian German" and most other category names are fine.<br /> I propose we move all the reduplicated categories (like "French French") to either the "France French" format some categories already use, or to a format like "French of France". (Should we move ''all'' categories, including "Austrian German", etc, to one of those formats? It'd be consistent, but unnecessary in most cases.)

::: Yeah, that's a concern I have, too — "Austrian German" and most categories have perfectly good names as-is, it's only a minority that are problematic. I certainly don't want to have ''three'' competing formats ("[place-adjective] [language]", "[place-noun] [language]", "[language] of [place]"), so if we're not prepared to switch in general to a "[language] of [place]" format, I suppose the status quo of occasionally deviating from "[place-adjective] [language]" to "[place-noun] [language]" is functional, if a bit ''[[unschön]]''.

== Get rid of the parentheses around inflections in headword lines ==

Instead of putting parentheses there, I'm thinking it might look cleaner to separate the inflections with an m-dash or something similar. Something like this:

: {{head|en|noun|head=test}} &mdash; ''plural'' '''{{l|en|tests}}'''

An advantage is that it looks nicer when you put qualifiers or transliterations there. Those features aren't used much, but they are available.

== The dot before the first transliteration on some entries' headword lines ==

The thread above this prompted me to look closely at how headword-lines are formatted, and it strikes me that having a dot before only the first transliteration on only the headword line of only some entries creates an awkward and inconsistent amount of space. For example, in [[буква]]: why should "(búkva)" be further away from "бу́ква" than it is from "f inan"? and why should "(búkva)" be further away from "буква" than "(''Latin spelling'' žagati)" is from "жагати" in [[[[жагати]]]], or than "(''romaji'' aizōban)" is from "[[あいぞうばん]]" in that entry? The dot is especially awkward in entries like {{m|ar|حَدُثَ}}, where the headword-line goes on to give another word and its translit, and the second translit is ''not'' separated by a dot. I propose we eliminate the dot. <br /> I know that for the tiny number of languages which have <samp>WT:_ transliteration</samp> pages, the dot serves as an easter egg for the tiny number of people who notice that it contains a link. The link could either be moved to the transliteration itself, i.e. <samp>бу́ква ([[Wiktionary:Russian transliteration|búkva]])</samp>, or just omitted because a nearly unnoticeable link that only exists for a few languages and points to a page that's frankly not very useful is, well, not so useful that it needs to stay... I mean entries don't even normally link to <samp>WT:About _</samp> pages AFAIK, and those are frequently more useful. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 08:30, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== [[User:Pereru]] and sources again ==

This user has started adding all kinds of templates like {{temp|needsources}} and {{temp|needref}} to entries again. These templates don't serve a purpose as there is no strict need for sources. You can't ask for sources if there aren't any.

More annoyingly, the user is now also preventing me from editing and fixing up etymologies, reasoning that I may only write what agrees with the source. This is complete nonsense; if sources restrict what edits Wiktionarians may make, then the sources need to go. Or better yet, the users need to stop doing that and let editors do their work. If sources prevent me from improving Wiktionary, I'm going to start removing them. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:39, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:The template {{temp|needsources}} was kept, as in the decision above, and is believed to be useful. Adding it to an entry does not change any of its contents, it merely points out that there are no sources and that it would be an improvement to add them. If there are no sources, add a rationale -- the template says so. If you want, we can talk about how to do that. But adding information that is based on something -- even original research -- wihtout mentioning its source or rationale -- that is in no way an improvement.
:Ahn... Please don't misrepresent me. What I'm saying is that etymologies cannot float in the vacuum. If you don't have a source to add, add a rationale. You often do a quick'n'dirty one in the edit summary -- why not add a better one to the text itself?
:I insist: '''I am not preventing you from fixing etymologies: I merely think that, by letting them float in the air, you're making them worse'''. Ground your etymologies, and I'll have no problem with what you do. Please, don't misrepresent what I say.--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:45, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Why is a rationale needed? Specify which parts of an etymology are in doubt. Or better yet, take it to [[WT:ES]]. Putting a template on the entry solves nothing at all. The template itself needs a rationale just as much for it to be useful.
::: Because the reader is not a Wiktionarian. He's not trying to discuss etymologies. He wants to know what the jist is of the reason why this form is here rather than some other form. He is not a critic: he just wants to know ''how Wiktionary decided that this was the right form''. It's information, it's relevant, it should be on the page. Why is this even a problem? Are you trying to hide something?
:: I'm also not amused by your continued stance against Balto-Slavic. Balto-Slavic is accepted and has consensus among linguists, yet whenever I add it to an entry you put brackets around it and add "perhaps", while keeping your own Baltic-only etymologies displayed prominently. Wiktionary is not here to promote your fringe anti-Balto-Slavic views. We should show the current state of research. I think if you continue to exclude Balto-Slavic or play down its relevance or acceptance, then you should stop editing etymologies altogether. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:07, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Not the linguists I've talked to, no. But even if it were a consensus -- I don't have a problem with you adding Proto-BS to Wiktionary. I have a problem with you not ''arguing'' for the forms (same for Proto-IE, by the way). If you've invented them yourself, say so and state why. Why is this so difficult? If you're proposing a hypothesis, ''justify it'' on the page! If it's an argument that is generally valid for many words, write it up somewhere and link to it on the page! The "perhaps" there is meant to show that there is no reason for that form ''given here in Wiktionary'' -- if you add a reason, a justification for that form, then I'll be happy to delete any hedges.
::: Let me turn the argument against you: Wiktionary is also not here to support your anti-source, anti-rationale agenda. Being against sources and insisting on hiding the reasons why you choose one specific protoform when there are other in the literature and when there often is disagreement among Wiktionarians (see Štambuk and you on Kim vs. the Leiden school) does not make anything better here -- it arguably makes things worse. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:15, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

:::::: Yes, and which reasons are unclear? What needs explaining? Specify which aspects of the etymology are unclear and need explanation. And don't say "all of it" because that would make no sense; not a single etymological source explains ''everything'' about an etymology. The reader is always assumed, by every work, to have an understanding of the linguistics. What etymological sources do is they explain special parts of the etymology that may be surprising or unexpected, or aspects of a language's development that are unknown or not fully consensus. So you need to specify which parts of the etymology are unclear and need motivating.
::::::: I need to see the rationale in order to tell you if I think there is something wrong about it. Just as I need to see the definition of a word to see if I think it's wrong. A word without a definition is not useful in a dictionary. An etymology without a source or rationale is just floating in space, it is a speculation of its author. This should be obvious. Ask yourself: why is it that every good etymological dictionary known to man has both sources and justifications for the protoforms it lists? Are they really all wrong in doing that?
:::::: Also, aside from all of this, you do realise that all this applies to you as well? You'll have to give motivations in all your etymologies as well. ''Especially'' the ones that promote Baltic while dismissing Balto-Slavic. Fringe and unusual ideas should always be subject to higher scrutiny. So if you have a particular reason for going against the majority view that Balto-Slavic is a real thing, then you will have to explain this ''and'' why this view should be preferred in Wiktionary etymologies. Because I don't think there is a consensus for excluding or minimising Balto-Slavic. It has more support among linguists than Baltic does. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:43, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

::::::: I'm all in favor of scrutiny! My entire point is that ''you provide no scrutiny''.

Please, do some scrutinizing. And '''write it down''' for other to see and scrutinize, too! Your distaste for justifications and/or sources is the fringiest idea I've seen: I don't know a single person interested in historical linguistics who supports that, including the other Wiktionarians here.

== Sources, despite [[User:CodeCat]] ==
Frankly, here is my personal approach to this. If anyone (except CodeCat, who really isn't impartial about this issue) thinks I'm wrong, please let me know.

* I think sources <u>and/or rationales</u> (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) make etymologies more trustworthy, because they show to that Wiktionary has done its homework and allow the more educated user to check whether or not s/he agrees with Wiktionary (this is especially important when an etymology is Wiktionary's own).
* Sources <u>and/or rationales</u> (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) are easy to add: if you're copying the info from somewhere, write down where from. If you're creating it yourself, write down why this is better.
* If an entry doesn't have sources '''and/or rationales''' (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason), then it's OK to add a template that says so, so that those who are interested can take care of it. It's not different from templates like {{temp|rfap}}, which I also use extensively to encourage Latvian speakers to add audio pronunciation files.

What is wrong about any of the above? And in what way does any of the above prevent anyone from working?

CodeCat and I have been reverting each other's edits for a few minutes. I will no longer do that -- it's more than a bit childish -- but I will leave here my request that something be done about it. This page is a discussion forum where such problems can hopefully be resolved. Let us talk about that, then, and come to some sort of conclusion, so that we can finally go on doing things without sudden tantrums from our estimated colleagues. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:03, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

*CodeCat, I think previous discussions have made abundantly clear that the only person here who thinks there is no need for reconstructions to have some kind of reference is you. Given that fact, it would be wise of you to stop edit-warring {{temp|needsources}} (which was RFD-kept per consensus) out of entries. Let's start working on a template or format for presenting "Wiktionarian research" / "rationales" on entries which lack scholarly references. For reconstructions based on known sound correspondances, perhaps we could document the sound correspondances on an 'About' page (or similar page) and then have a template that says "Reconstructed by Wiktionary according to [[foobar-link|known sound correspondences]]" which could be placed in the references section or at the bottom of the entry {{temp|Webster}}- and {{temp|LDL}}-style.

** The issue I have is that these templates are telling me to add references and sources. There aren't any, so I remove the template. What point is there in asking for something that doesn't exist? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:11, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
*** The template says ''sources '''and/or rationales'''''. If there is no source, add a rationale. Are you claiming the rationales also don't exist? Supposedly you haven't been picking protoforms randomly... have you? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:20, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
*** (e/c) The template explicitly asks for either pre-existing scholarly sources, or what it currently calls "original research" (that wording and the format it prescribes need to be improved, but the meaning is clear). On Wikipedia and some other Wiktionaries, like de.Wikt, you would be blocked if you kept adding original etymological research. We're offering you a big concession, a big compromise — you get to keep adding your OR (whereas newer users even on this wiki have been threatened with blocks, as recently as last week, for adding OR etymologies), but you have to provide your rationales for it — for each reconstruction you invent. If you aren't willing to do that, previous discussions have made clear that there are quite a few people who would be happy to simply delete and ban all etymological OR. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:23, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
**** You're making it sound like there's this big change that has to be made to allow unsourced etymologies. But it's just the status quo. So I keep doing what has always been done, as there hasn't been a policy change. Don't make it sound like a concession because it isn't. If you want to require sources for all etymologies, '''make a policy and enforce it''' (which would mean removing somewhere around 90% of all etymology sections and reconstructions). That's all I ask for. Until then, you need to be clearer about what's wrong with the etymologies. Just asking for sources and rationales is going to get ignored. Pereru can patrol his fringe etymologies all he wants, that's fine with me. Latvian is not my responsibility.

@Pereru ''And since nobody disagreed, I suppose this means we have a policy?'' From what I gather CC insists that a lack of voted-on, explicit policy negates the fundamental clause that "Wiktionary is a secondary source" (which means that wikt allows some elements of synthesis but the synthesized sources still need to be cited.)

Anyways, can this be a thing? In case I disappear I would like to document my '''support''' of a potential policy requiring sources, including for synthesis [e.g., "''bebe'' could be considered derived from ''baba'' because source X says that ''ebe'' is derived from ''aba''" and so forth, the keyword here being ''source X''.] [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 21:51, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== Is [[User:CodeCat]]'s behavior a problem? ==
I have personally nothing against CodeCat's work, which is excellent in many areas of Wiktionary. But his/her behavior with respect to sourcing and providing support for his/her etymological choices are causing increasing concern. Despite the majority view that {{template|needsources}} was useful, and that sources '''and/or rationales''' (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) improve an entry (just like audio pronunciations do, which is why there are templates like {{template|rfap}}), CodeCat is doing his/her damndest to make this particular part of the job -- selecting the entries that need this improvement, and then going about doing it -- irritatingly difficult. Again, I have nothing against all other contributions by CodeCat, who, as far as I know, is a good person. I'm not against the person, I'm against the behavior, which, as I think most people agree, is not justified.<br>

== Czech possessive adjectives - etymology and related terms ==

First off, the term "Czech possessive adjective" does not find much use but I do not find a better one. Czech possessive adjectives would be the likes of [[orlův]] (eagle's) from [[orel]] (eagle). They are much like English possessive forms that we do not include for the reason that the apostrophe makes them effectively sum of parts; that is not the case with the Czech forms. In Czech, there is still a distinction between [[orlův]] and [[orlí]]; the latter would be used in the translation for "eagle's nest".

Now, how to treat them as for '''etymology and related terms'''?. I want that entries for them do not repeat the etymology of the base term, and I want to see no "Related terms" section. I prefer that they be treated a bit like items in [[:Category:Latin participles]]. In this, I seem to differ from [[User:Jan.Kamenicek]].

A possessive adjective is created for great many animate nouns, most often referring to humans but also sometimes to animals. They include matčin (and forms matčina, matčino), otcův, sestřin, bratrův, synův, orlův, etc. They are not to be confused with koní, orlí, kočičí, psí, člověčí, etc.

I am asking for input from other people. I am looking forward to getting a view from other languages that have a similar feature, maybe Russian and other Slavic languages, but also other languages. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:38, 23 August 2015 (UTC)

:The term "Czech possessive adjective" does not find much use because there are not many English books dealing with them. The term "Czech hard adjectives" seems to find even less use, but they do exist. It is also not easy to filter them out, because not all books dealing with Czech possessive adjectives use the phrase "Czech possessive adjectives", they can talk simply about Czech language and use only the phrase "possessive adjectives" (such as here: [https://books.google.cz/books?id=EdjXAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false]).
:I believe that all the expressions like {{m|cs|orel}}, {{m|cs|orlice}}, {{m|cs|orlí}} or {{m|cs|orlův}} should be listed in the categories like [[:Category:Czech terms derived from Proto-Slavic]] and therefore their etymology sections should include information that they "come from  {{cog|sla-pro|*orьlъ}}", which also puts it into the correct category.
:As for the "eagle's nest": it can be translated in both ways (depending on context) as ''orlí hnízdo'' (talking about the kind of nest), or ''orlovo hnízdo'' (nominative neuter of ''orlův'') The latter is used quite rarely, usually when referring to a nest belonging to a specific eagle, but examples when it is used as a synonym for "orlí" can be also found (usually in poetry or in old texts, one of them is in the quotation in the entry {{m|cs|orlův}}).

:::: Maybe possessive adjectives should be ranked as non-lemmas, along with Latin participles and Czech comparatives ([[menší]]). It would be consistent with the practice of PSJC and SSJC. But I do not think it obvious that there should only be lemmas and non-lemmas, and that's it. For instance, many editors prefer to create some entries as ''alternative forms'', and prefer to centralize etymology in the main entry and avoid it in the alternative form. The alternative form is still a lemma, but it is a secondary entry from the standpoint of information management. I have even seen some editors use the word "lemma" to mean "main entry" rather than "the word form representing all the inflected forms of the word".

:Was ''orlův'' separate from ''orel'' in Proto-Slavic, or was it only formed in Czech? If it was only formed in Czech, then I agree with Dan and Neitrāls: just say how it's derived from ''orel'' and put the history of ''orel'' in that entry. Just because something is its own lemma doesn't mean we have to duplicate (knowing it will come unsynced) information in multiple entries; ''[[rigidify]]'' is its own lemma independent of ''[[rigid]]'', but doesn't repeat ''rigid''’s etymology. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:12, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
::Generally speaking, possessive adjectives appeared already in Proto-Slavic, see [[Appendix:Proto-Slavic/-ovъ]]. The possessives with the suffix *-ovъ changed in Proto-Czech (between 10th and 13th century) to -óv and later -uov, which changed into modern -ův.
::Unlike huge x hugely, there are often more changes taking place when creating Czech possessives than adding the suffix, compare e. g. [[Radka]] x Radčin.
::Besides this, I think that all words which have roots in proto-languages, should be listed in the categories like Terms derived from Proto-... . I don't think that only one representant of a group of related words should be listed there. Using the {{template|template:etyl}} in the etymology section is a good way to do so. Or should the category be added manually? [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 21:01, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
::: The fact that going from "matka" to "matčin" does not look like plain suffixing does not matter; it is the property of Czech morphology (inflectional and derivational alike) that it often does not work like plain suffixing on the surface level. For instance, "bedna" --> "bednář" = "bedna" - "a" + "ář"; "samec" --> "samčí"; "vyrobit" --> "výrobce" = "vyrobit" - "it" + "ce" with "y" made acute or the like; "dům" --> "domeček" (ů went to o); "orel" --> "orlíček" (e dropped); "hrdlo" --> "hrdelní"; etc.
::: What matters is that we are dealing with a very productive derivation or inflection pattern, like in English for -ly, -ness, -hood, -ify, -ing, etc. And what matters is whether we want to have etymologies like the one currently in [[orlův]], which says this:<p> "From orel + -ův. Noun orel comes from Proto-Slavic *orьlъ, which is from Proto-Indo-European *h₃er- (“big bird, eagle”).[1]"</p><p> As you can see, the etymology first indicates the suffixing, and then goes into detailing the etymology of the component "orel". That is really like "swimming" detailing the etymology of "swim", and "merrily" detailing the etymology of "merry".</p>
::: Whether possessives ''in general'' originated early or not does not seem to matter. What matters is the particular etymology, and whether it is of the form "base + suffix. Base is from base-etymology" rather than what we see e.g. in [[windmill]], which could conceivably be "wind + mill", but can in fact be traced to Old English *windmylen. I do not think that ''all compounds'' should provide the etymologies of the component terms on the pages of the compounds. Put in general terms, I do not think that all etymologies of all terms resulting from derivation (prefixing, suffixing, compounding, etc.) should repeat the etymologies of their base terms. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:10, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

== Question (re: sourcing) ==

So, there was this thing that I wanted to get a feel of the general attitude.

Do passages/statements attributed to an author or a book need to actually reflect what the author/book says? Can they be changed ("corrected") with something that author doesn't say while still attributing it to them?

My answer would probably be "are you effing kidding me?" (lol) Then again en.wikt can be a serious "land of the bent mirrors" [don't remember the correct idiom] and things that I see as common sense some others don't even consider.

This is referring to a discussion 3 headers up (that I actually missed) where (to sum it up somewhat snarkily) CodeCat says that that book is stupid and needs her corrections while still proudly displaying the reference [1] at the end despite (in some cases) all the core information being changed. For example in {{m|lv|akmens}} the direct parent root was changed, then extrapolating from that the proto-group was changed and a different PIE root introduced (none of these things are to be found in the source cited.) I call this manufactured references/misattribution but maybe I'm dumb...?

Would like others' input.

And more generally this thing has been lingering on for years, the crux of the matter is that CC demands an explicit, voted-on policy, why not just do it, it could be something very simple, something to the effect:
*Wiktionary by previous consensus is a secondary source, this explicitly applies to etymologies, sources need to be provided, in case of synthesis, the synthesized works need to be attributed.
**Usage of templates to keep track of unsourced pages is to be encouraged.
**Attribution of statements to an author that they didn't make is to be avoided.

What do you think about that? Perhaps [[User:Dan Polansky]] could help set it up? [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 14:57, 23 August 2015 (UTC)

: As for ''policy page'', the main thing is ''consensus'' and ''evidence of consensus'', IMHO. A policy page by itself is a poor evidence of consensus; it merely makes things convenient for newcomers who then do not need to wade through previous votes to find what the decision was. Thus, a policy page is not strictly necessary, IMHO.

== Recreating Proto-Baltic (and other "deprecated" languages) with a different status? ==
Proto-Baltic was recently discontinued as an accepted language in Wiktionary. I was against it, because it doesn't seem to me that the discussion is over (and because there is no real authoritative source for PBS etyma yet), so it seemed premature, but OK, I can live with that. The problem, it seems to me, is that this forces changing quotes from sources in ways that don't seem legitimate. If a source reconstructs a form as Proto-Baltic, renaming it as Proto-Balto-Slavic without any further changes (e.g., replacing it with a different source) seems to me illegitimate. So: how about having a different status for Proto-Baltic? Say, "older/deprecated/obsolete Proto-language" or something like that? In this manner, we could list deprecated protoforms here (with templates duly identifying them as such) in the same way we list "misspellings of" or "alternative forms of" or "obsolete forms of" words in the main namespace. Here are a couple of reasons:
# People will still come upon older reconstructions -- they are, after all, attested in papers, etymological dictionaries, and other similar sourcces --, and may want to know what they were and why they were abandoned; it would thus be useful to have pages with these forms (clearly tagged as "deprecated" or something like that, and linked to the most recent and most widely accepted form), just as in biological taxonomy it is useful to have lists of old, deprecated scientific names so that older articles can still be read and understood correctly
# To follow the history of a proposed protoform, knowing its predecessors is important -- often, a new protoform is proposed in explicit opposition to, or as an explicit correction of, an earlier proposal. Being able to track these would be useful in understanding the state-of-the-art.
What do y'all think?

: You can still reference a source that reconstructs a Proto-Baltic term in a Proto-Balto-Slavic entry. Think of it this way: ''we'' are reconstructing a Proto-Balto-Slavic term based on someone else's reconstruction of a Proto-Baltic term. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:01, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Sure, but the Proto-Balto-Slavic reconstruction will ultimately look different, at least in that it refers to a different level. (Most PBS entries here look very much different from the PB forms on which they are based). Someone who sees a PB form somewhere and wants to know what it is won't find a page about it here. Shouldn't there be one -- in the same way that there are "alternative spelling of" and "obsolete form of" pages? In this way we don't misrepresent sources, and we allow users to find exactly the form they saw in some source and track its status (deprecated) and understand why it was replaced by the PBS form. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 15:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Let me give an example. A proto-Baltic form, like e.g. [[Appendix:Proto-Baltic/*akemns]], would have an initial template saying something like: "This protoform is '''deprecated'''. The current consensus form is [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic/akmo]]. Reasons for this change are indicated below. See also [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] for the current view on this branch of Indo-European." In the page itself, the sources for that form (say, Karulis' LEV) would be cited. In this way, the reader would know what this form is, where it came from, and what it was abandoned for. The end result would seem to me to be at least as useful as "alternative spelling of" or "obsolete form of" pages. (I imagine there would also be a heading in the current reconstruction -- something like <nowiki>==Deprecated forms==</nowiki> or <nowiki>==Older proposed forms==</nowiki> -- to link the currently accepted protoform to its previous incarnations.)--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 15:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::: You may be right about including them in some way, shape, or form, but this has nothing to do with misrepresenting sources.

Their spelling is often exactly what is being claimed -- a *X instead of a *X'. In other words, the sounds that compose the protoform are exactly the theoretical point that is being made; and, in this case, of course the spelling matters, in fact it is what matters most. There can of course be general problems that can be solved in a general way -- researcher 1 uses X for a certain sound (say little glottal stops), while researcher 2 uses Y (say accent amrks) -- and you can adapt the spellings to reflect that (as long as you are consistent, and you write up somewhere why you chose to regularize this difference in the way you did -- and link it to the pages where it is relevant). But in most cases this is not so, and differences in spelling mean something much more serious -- and they should be better documented. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:11, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

Some sources for PIE write h₂ while others write H₂. These are different things in writing, but we know and understand that they mean the same thing; they are equivalent even if they are not equal. So we can exchange one for the other without problems. Likewise, in Wikitiki's example, "colour" and "color" are unequal representations of equivalent meanings (I might call them "equivalent words", but this hinges on the question of whether different spellings make different words). —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:57, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

And since you do know why you preferred h₂ to H₂, explaining it in writing shouldn't be a problem. You would only need to do it once, in one page (where you could explain all the other similar choices you made), and then link it to new PIE entries.

But at the same time, a lot of Wiktionary's practices and conventions are unwritten; we follow them because we learn from existing examples that are already on Wiktionary.

::::::::::::: Good, let's do it like that in the future then. Write up your favorite spelling choices for PIE (h₂ instead of H₂), their reasons (in this case, I suppose because h₂ is more recent?), and voilà: no more for reasons for complains, and people can go back to arguing the merits. The point is not justifying it to other Wiktionarians (though that in itself is not bad: there are always new people coming who don't know where this decision came from, and I'm sure they'd appreciate the information), but to users. If someone checks an etymology here and sees something s/he finds strange, and there is no justification anywhere for it, then this doesn't make Wiktionary look more trustworthy. Again: I'm not suggesting a discussion (unless people think there should be one), I'm suggesting documenting choices, to show, at first sight, that they are choices, not mistakes. Besides, there are things that are much more important than h₂, like your current diatribe about how to spell proto-BS intonations. After this is over, don't you think it would be a service to others to write down somewhere why one variant was preferred?

As for complaints, I did complain against your standards, and I've seen several peole (Štambuk, -sche) disagreeeing with your standards in specific cases, so I think you're assuming a non-existing consensus here.

:::::: There's also the case where different sources disagree on certain sound laws. For example there's a subset of linguists that thinks the change o > a happened independently in all the Balto-Slavic branches rather than in Balto-Slavic itself. In this case, too, we have to pick one particular set of sound laws as the "main" one. Our existing pages treat the o > a change as Balto-Slavic. Likewise, some sources may neglect to indicate accent or acutes even when all descendants are in agreement. You can compare this to Pokorny's reconstructions for PIE: they don't reflect modern understandings so they have all kinds of weird schwas and long vowels while lacking laryngeals. So imagine that the only source we have on a particular form is Pokorny; should we allow ourselves to bring the form up to par?

Things like "different sound laws" can be part of the discussion. All the problems you mention above can be summarized and written up in a page (e.g., [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European sources]]) to which you can refer as part of your explanations for preferring one form over another.

::::::::: We don't have to motivate and discuss every single choice we make. For Dutch entries, we choose the spelling as prescribed by the Dutch language union as the norm for lemmas, even though not everyone uses it and some people advocate alternatives. This choice is not motivated or discussed; it's simply set as a rule and accepted by our Dutch editors. In the same way, it's not necessary to discuss why we picked one particular set of sound laws to base our reconstructions on. In many cases, the choice is arbitrary and we simply picked one because we had to make a choice. I think it's more important for us all to agree on a set representation and sound laws for Balto-Slavic reconstructions, than it is for us to discuss and motivate it all. Not that it's not welcome and valuable to give reasons for choosing one particular thing, but that's secondary to making the choice in the first place.

See, a reconstruction is not a ''word'', but an ''idea''; and, as for every idea, justifying it is important. The spelling of a Dutch word is not an idea that is being discussed by several people right now and with different, equally authorative variants (for a still different, but more comparable case, see Nynorsk vs. Bokmål). That's what historical linguists do -- they justify their reconstructions -- and that's what you should do, too, if you care about reconstructions. When you say "we don't have to justify it", you're making a "petitio principii" without there actually being policy on this. Why don't you start a policy page on why we don't have to justify choosing one etymology over another, one set of sound laws over another (thus disputing [[Wiktionary:Etymology]] and let people vote on it? You keep talking as if everybody agreed with you, when this is clearly not the case, much the opposite. I'd like to see you try to defend and get this "policy" of yours approved. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:08, 24 August 2015 (UTC) 
::::::::::::: Well of course, there must be a consensus. I'm aware that the current representation of Balto-Slavic doesn't have consensus, as both you and Ivan seem to disagree on it. But Ivan's solution was to simply create alternative (duplicate) entries or move mine, which of course is no way to come to an agreement. So the question becomes how do we come to an agreement on things, and if we don't, what should be done with existing and future Balto-Slavic pages? Right now, the majority of them has been created by me, so they mostly reflect the (unwritten) standards I follow. But if we insist that there must be consensus first, what do we do with them? Should they be deleted until there is an agreement on them? What about Balto-Slavic forms in etymologies? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::It's not simply that there should be a consensus -- the consensus shouldn't be hidden, buried in some page that was archived three years ago. The reason for the consensus should be right there, on the page, or at least in [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European]], so that the reader knows what consensus decisions you made, and why. Since you're talking about theories, not words that exist in real languages, then your sources and/or arguments are the basic reason why the protoword is here -- i.e., they are precisely the most important piece of information. (I don't disagree with anyone's spelling of proto-BS, by the way, simply because I'm not sufficiently familiar with it to have a principled opinion. But I see you disagree -- and given this fact, why create pages with one spelling when you can't even agree this is the right thing to do? Why not create a paragraph in, say, [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]], that summarizes this discussion -- after you're done with --, lists your conclusion and the reasons for it? Then you can follow it consistently, and nobody -- or at least not I -- will complain. What I keep not understanding is this need to hide your reasons: that makes no sense to me at all; and it's something that no etymological dictionary I know of has ever done. Why this innovation? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::: Consensus doesn't necessarily have to be formed through discussion. Sometimes all that's needed is for one person to do something and for others to then follow that example. Consensus is often silent, and therefore undocumented, reflected only in practice. There's no documented consensus for most of the edits people make to Wiktionary entries; it's simply the fact that they're left unreverted that creates a sense of agreement for the new status quo. It's only when someone disputes something that a lack of consensus becomes obvious. In the case of Balto-Slavic, you two have voiced your opinions, so that's how I know. I continued creating entries because I figured, the source of the dispute is the naming, but we can still have good content and when we solve the dispute we can rename the entries. I haven't made further attempts to come to a consensus because the attempts I ''did'' make didn't work; Ivan's opinions were fundamentally different from mine on this matter, and nobody else seemed to care enough to provide a third voice, so the matter remained unresolved and both of us just kept doing our own thing. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:28, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::True. And sometimes what is necessary to challenge it is for someone to come here and say "but this is not right, and here's why". And that's what I'm doing, quite legitimately so, since what I am asking for is no more, no less than what every good etymological dictionary known to man already does -- sources + justifications. So: me being here, and the reactions of several others, show that there is no consensus here. If I were you, I would stop adding any new words, and concentrate on justifying the ones you've added already. You know the reasons you had for creating them, so this shouldn't be a problem. What to do with the proto-BS (or IE, or FU...) words? Justify them. If in the future a given justification is abandoned, because a new one came up... then all those pages will need to be moved, and a new justification added. That's how things go with ideas that aren't attested words (and add the reasons why). --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:44, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::: Oh of course, challenge and counter-challenge. And then eventually there's either an agreement, or we all give up until the next time. I actually find it much easier to discuss things with many participants though, that way things are more nuanced and it's not just two opposites clashing and getting nowhere. Much less chance of a stalemate. I will see if I can write up a proposal for PBS reconstructions with those motivations you're after so much. No promises though. I will refrain from creating any more until I do this, but I ask you not to add your templates to the pages. You should also remove them from Germanic pages because the norms are already explained at [[WT:AGEM]], have consensus, and therefore don't need further justification. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:05, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::::: Yes, the Wiktionarian way, isn't it? So conducive to the right result!... I also like it when there are more participants. Please! And I will indeed be glad to see you write up your proposals, so that others can see what exactly are the tacit rules you're tacitly following with the tacit (dis)agreement of your peers. [[WT:AGEM]] is actually quite good -- proficiat! But it doesn't say why sources or justifications should not be added. (I keep saying: you're following a policy that is not used in any goood etymological dictionary anywhere. "Consensus" indeed!...) I will refrain from adding the template to them for now, but unless someone explains why there shouldn't be sources/justifications in Proto-Germanic words I will eventually return to adding them. Why should it be less good to source/justify Proto-Germanic reconstructions than those of any other protolanguage? As in the other cases, they aren't words, their justification is a crucial element to their eligibility for having a page that states they are the "right" protoform, etc.- --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:49, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

::: Of course, the names of Balto-Slavic pages should agree in notation with what is already the current practice for BS entries. Acutes and accent should be indicated when known, and the distinction between ś/ź (former palatovelars) and š (from RUKI) should be maintained, while the letter ž is not used for Balto-Slavic. This means that such things should be corrected for in the redirect as well. If certain features are reconstructible but not indicated in the page name, this should be explained in the entry. For example, if Slavic and Latvian have s while Lithuanian has š, then the expected reconstruction is ś and any difference should be accounted for by the entry. Likewise, if the descendants all indicate an acute but the page name has none, this too needs explaining. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:05, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Hi CodeCat! Glad you're not whimsically blocking people today.<!-- change of someone else's comment deleted by Pereru --> Now, to keep a form that was reconstructed as PB under a PBS heading would be as wrong as keeping a Latvian word under a Lithuanian heading -- it simply disagrees with the source, i.e. it is factually wrong information. The various letters are just notational conventions, differing from author to author, and could probably be resolved with redirect pages. (You could of course also include this information about Proto-Baltic in the Proto-Balto-Slavic page itself, but I don't see how this would be any better -- care to elaborate?
:::: Let me give an example. I'm going to recreate the [[Appendix:Proto-Baltic/akmens]] page -- CodeCat, please refrain from deleting it until the discussion here is complete -- and make it look like what I'm thinking. Then you guys can give your opinions. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:34, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Latvian vs Lithuanian is irrelevant here, that's a completely different case. They are real attested languages, and to label a Latvian word as Lithuanian would be a misrepresentation of the attested facts (not the sources; sources are irrelevant for attestation as we are a secondary source). But for etymologies, sources aren't facts, they're proposals. And as an independent etymological source, we're allowed to make different proposals. So if we think that no, your Baltic reconstruction doesn't make much sense, here's a Balto-Slavic one we agree with more, then we are allowed to do that. Being a secondary source means that we do our own interpretation of the facts. We can of course ''use'' the proposals of others as part of ours, which we do. And we should definitely source that. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:44, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: And reconstructed protoforms are attested as claims at certain levels; and to misrepresent the claims as different from what they were is wrong. If you prefer, compare it to adding a quote to a certain word, but (a) misspelling words in it, or (b) attributing it to the wrong source. Not the right move, ahn?
:::::: Thank you so much for saying the sources are ''proposals'' -- I had said that to you so many times, I thought you never would agree with me. That's exactly why it's so important to ground them. See, when you create a protofrom page here, you're not creating a word: you're creating a ''proposal''. And what makes proposals good or bad are the arguments that support them -- as you yourself said, they are not attested facts. ''That is exactly why sourcing and arguing them is so important: proposals without the accompanying argumentation are not compelling.''
::::::: Finally, I have no Baltic reconstructions -- Karulis does. Take it up with ''him'' if you want, not me. Just like you haven't invented any of the Dutch words you contributed to Wiktionary (right? you haven't, have you? I mean, maybe you think Dutch is like Proto-BS and you should be allowed to add even the ones you invented yourself without further justification...). I have absolutely no problem with you changing any Proto-Baltic etymologies ''as long as you document you reason for doing so, or your source, etc.'' -- so that the reader can see ''why this is supposed to be better''. I repeat: it's not much work, it takes a couple of minutes, and you must have the information already since you're making judgments on the basis of it. There is absolutely no valid reason for you not to do that. Period. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:08, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: Adding a source to our proposals just says "we agree with this idea". But that doesn't make sourcing important necessarily. Maybe there aren't any proposals that we agree with, and in that case we have nothing to source. So what Karulis says may be nice, but they are your reconstructions as soon as you put them in etymologies. Again, the source simply says that Karulis agrees with you, but ''you'' put it in the etymology, so ''you'' are proposing it in the name of Wiktionary. And I'm not required to give motivation for changing the etymology if there isn't one to begin with. Take your favourite edit warring target {{m|lv|suns}} for example; the form is not motivated at all, but simply stated as fact, with reference to Karulis. This seems like exactly the kind of thing you're advocating against. A proper etymology, as I understand your view to be, would provide a motivation for the reconstruction. This motivation may itself come from Karulis's work, or it may be your own supplement. Or, it could be documented centrally in an appendix so that we don't have to write it down everywhere. But would have to exist, even for proposals that are sourced. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: Also an added note: Karulis's reconstruction for {{m|lv|suns}} is demonstrably wrong, because it shows the ō > uo diphthongisation for both East and West Baltic. This change only occurred in East Baltic, and is not found in West Baltic<sup>{{temp|R:Fortson 2004}}</sup> so the form Karulis gives is Proto-''East''-Baltic. This is one of the reasons I am against over-reliance on sources; sometimes they are quite obviously wrong. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:34, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:{{outdent}} If we change ''[[suns]]'' from saying "From ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Karulis, ''Book''&lt;/ref&gt;" to saying "According to Karulis, from ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;''Book by Karulis''&lt;/ref&gt;", does that solve at least some of this dispute? That's what was done once before when there was dispute over the etymology of ''[[bensin]]'' — the entry was rephrased to attribute the etymological theory explicitly, rather than giving it in "Wiktionary's voice". [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:45, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I think it would help, because, to me, the main problem is making sure that everybody's opinion is clearly marked -- Karulis', CC's (or Wiktionary's), etc. It's all a question of knowing we are reporting the right thing.
:: {{ping|CodeCat}}, look: the point is not whether Karulis is right or wrong -- I have no beef with that. The point is ''making sure your reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with him are documented somewhere, so the reader can see them and decide if s/he agrees with you or not.'' So: if you want to copy the paragraph you wrote above and place it, say, somewhere (in {{l|lv|suns}}, or in [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and then link it to {{l|lv|suns}}, adding a few words to the etymology discussion) -- I have no problem with that. My only problem is with you erasing or changing Karulis' opinion, and then contributing something that cannot be checked. Let me see if I put in bold you will finally react to this: '''I am not saying you have to believe your sources unconditionally; I am saying that you have to explain the choices you make.''' You're not explaining your choices; and it would be easy to do so: just create [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and do it there, and link it to other pages. (After discussing the 'best solution' with your colleagues, i.e. after you and Štambuk and whoever else is intersted finally agree on how to spell proto-BS words.) But if you simply take down Karulis' opinion without justifying it -- and obviously you can try to justify doing it, since you just did it in the preceding paragraph -- you are NOT improving Wiktionary; you're just making it look more whimsical. My entire point in a nutshell: why hide the reasons for making a choice, especially when this choice is the crucial thing -- the very name of the page you create depends on it? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Are you saying I need an Appendix page in order to remove an etymology I judge to be bad? Lots of other editors before me have simply edited out bad content, nothing to it. I'm just doing what others have also been doing already. It's you that's now trying to change all this and making it much more complicated, and then complaining when someone doesn't simply do it your new way and they start to butt heads with you. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:32, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Yes, but it's actually very simple. The Appendix page you need is a general guide to why certain things are 'bad content' -- they don't follow accepted correspondences, or they misapply sound laws, or are based on some idea (say, Glottalic Theory) that has been disproved, etc. Only one such page would probably solve all your problems. Then, when you remove an etymology that you think is bad and replace it with one you think is good, you mention in a footnote that so-and-so prosed the bad etymology, but then there's reason 1 and 2 (say, correspondence nr. 35, and sound law nomber 4) why this was bad -- see [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European reconstructions]] -- which is why it was removed here. For deeper differences you might have specific pages, but I don't think there would be many of those, no. And it would also be possible to link Wikipedia pages, in case you see one that you agree with and you think actually explains the issue. The actual argumentation for removing an etymology would probably be one sentence long, and be added as a footnote. You could also mark it as a "Wiktionary editorial decision" if you don't want your name there. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:01, 24 August 2015 (UTC) NOTE: but note also that you'd have to deal with those that disagree with your reason. I suggest that anyone who disagrees with an etymology should first mention it somewhere -- the talk page of the protoform in question, or maybe [[WT:ES]] -- before making the change. If you do make the change, then also be ready to discuss with whoever disagrees with it, and if his/her arguments are good, then incorporate them in your rationale for accepting and/or refusing his/her criticism in the original footnote that explains the change.--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:04, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Unless we make this a rule for the removal of ''any'' content, etymological or not, then I'm not on board with this proposal. It would have to be justified why the rules for removing bad etymologies are different from those for removing bad anything else. Wiktionarians have ''always'' had the prerogative to delete content they think is bad, and they've never had to refer to some kind of standards document to justify their removal. An edit summary has generally been enough, and often even that is not done. This has worked well enough so far that you're the first to propose a change. So I will be expecting a more general support for this idea as it seems like a solution without an obvious problem. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:10, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: You might do this if you want, though you yourself have pointed out repeatedly that etymologies are not words, so it's up to you to argue why they should follow the same rules. Feel free to present your arguments. As for me, obviously, protoforms (to quote your post) are proposals, not words; and, in science, proposals exist only because of their arguments. Unless you've changed your mind and no longer think protoforms are proposals rather than words, you should agree, for the sake of consistency with your own stated opinion.
::::::: I dispute the idea that Wiktionarians have always been free to delete whatever they thought was bad content; if they don't justify their deletions, they are stopped and blocked after a while -- i.e., others have to agree with them, tacitly or not, or else they are not allowed to continue. Adding justifications to protoforms, especially when you're making choices, falls within this general area. I maintain that for protoforms (= proposals), justifications are more important, let's say as important as sources are for quotes. You don't seem to want to address that, so I'll assume you tacitly agree (as you assume those Wiktionarians who don't revert your edits tacitly agree with you -- "tacit consensus", right? :-) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

I kind of like this idea – ''referenced'' Proto-Baltic pages with a clear disclaimer that it's a defunct grouping in its classical sense according to the most recent sources. (Disclaimer: I have yet to see serious challenging of Slavic being a daughter of W-Balt, thus I do not believe that there can be W-Balt + E-Balt grouping excluding Slav).

''We do not misrepresent PB sources by altering the form of the reconstruction to make it PBS-like. --WikiTiki89'' I agree with this, "sadly" that is not exactly the case ("correcting" referenced (even if deprecated by mod. stand.) PB forms to Orig. Res. PBS forms is what lead to edit-warring a while ago, in my reading of things.)

My (personal/pseudoscientific) reading between the lines of Pereru's proposal is that it would serve as another "safety valve" and, baby, we couldn't have enough of those, lol. [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 22:00, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

: From where I stand, PBS does look like a better grouping that PB (the evidence seems to be accumulating). But in the absence of a general work on the topic (say, a PBS etymological dictionary), I don't think it can be regarded as settled -- I'm just conservative on this point. But I have nothing against it as a theory, and as long as things are clearly marked and sources are not misrepresented, I have no problem with it. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
: Also, I'm not in principle against altering the forms of reconstructions -- I just think this should be done ''in the open'', with the rules clearly laid out and placed in some page where others can see them. What is the point of "adjusting" a form to a spelling that was not in the original source, and then doing nothing, not even adding a footnote, thus misrepresenting the original content? And it's so easy to do it right -- just add the footnote, or change the source to the one whose spelling you think is better. This implies adding only a few words, keeps things clean and organized, and doesn't prevent anyone from expressing his/her agreement or disagreement with this or that protoform. Why not do it? Or, worse yet in CodeCat's case, why ''fight'' against it? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:The discussion here (including other headers above) seems to have some of the problems arising from overdoing lexicography:
:# from trying to use sources to "attest" reconstructions,
:# and from treating reconstructions as "headwords" — instead of kind of index words for etymologically connected word groups.
:Creating redirects for alternate reconstructions, and discussion of competing (though not necessarily depreciated) approaches both sound like good ideas, but I do not see the benefit in creating separate pages altogether for reconstructions based on more or less the same data as another one.
:If (and it appears to me that this '''is''' an if) the point of protolang pages is to illustrate the connections between attested languages, then cutting down on repetition is necessary. We do not create separate appendices for things like West Germanic or Anglo-Frisian, even though they are ''known'' to have existed; since this stuff can be adequately discussed already in the "Proto-Germanic" appendices.
:I would hold that, strictly speaking, we have ''no such thing'' as an "accepted reconstructed language" on Wiktionary — that's why they go in the Appendix namespace to begin with. Which is not a namespace that means "just like mainspace, but for second-tier languages". As I see it, an appendix-only status means not only that protolanguages can be subject to new limitations like possibly requiring sources, but also that they don't need, and in some respects probably shouldn't, be treated as lexicographic subjects.
:I also welcome explaining systematic details on how and why to present reconstructions on pages like [[Wiktionary:About Proto-Balto-Slavic]]. That said, if the dispute is about a current inability to establish a consensus reconstruction of PBS that we could use as the index forms, there are a couple of alternate possibilities that can be considered:
:* Picking an index language and listing forms under its' reflex. In the 'stone' example above, we'd perhaps use Lithuanian ''akmuo''. This seems a bit difficult to fit into the Appendix:Proto-Whatever/word notation, though (it might appear to imply that it is a Proto-Baltic or Proto-Balto-Slavic form rather than Lithuanian).
:* Using rough "non-reconstructions". A convention introduced by I think Roger Blench is the symbol "#" in place of "*" when we have a cognate word-family but no systematic reconstruction scheme has been worked out in detail; and adding this to some kind of a "majority representation" (in principle partly arbitrary) of the word root's shape. In this case this would probably bring us to #akmV (since the ending seems to be the main issue).

::[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] said ''(..) problems arising from overdoing lexicography (..) from trying to use sources to "attest" reconstructions'' – Dan brought up that in their opinion protoforms need (in wiki jargon) tertiary sourcing (as opposed to secondary sources.) I completely agree with this (I also think that the vote that's "in the pipeline" essentially implies this.) A way to paraphrase it would be to say that protoforms need to be sourced as "ideas" or "concepts" (which is exactly what they are, imo) as opposed to sourcing them like "real words." On one hand the sourcing requirements are more stringent, OTOH in that they are not "words," things such as "uniformifying" their spelling would be allowed (and prob. encouraged) unlike "real words" where one would need an "alternative/archaic/blah spelling of". There's a bit of disc. on that [[Wiktionary talk:Votes/2013-10/Reconstructions need references#Rationale|here]].
:::It sounds like there might some kind of inflation of "source grades" going on here. In lexicography, an attestation is a primary source, while a mention in a research paper would be a secondary source. However, in etymology, attested words are merely ''data'', while a publication proposing an etymology or a reconstruction is a ''primary'' source. An etymological dictionary would be a secondary source; it'd take something like an etymology section in a general-purpose dictionary to reach a tertiary source. And as usual, there should be no reason to demand tertiary sources specifically.
:::It also follows that basing a reconstruction on "just look at these words here" is not merely synthesis of existing sources, it's unambiguously original research; and, similarly, demanding etymdict-type sources would be equal to positioning Wiktionary as a Wikipedia-type tertiary source. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 20:32, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::::''In lexicography, an attestation is a primary source'' – I think on wikt. this is treated as secondary(?) – their head/brain was the "primary source," then they publish it (which renders it "archived") and then it becomes secondary (in my reading of wiki jargon anyhow.)

::::: Etymological dictionaries are sources of new information as well, not just research papers. I consider them secondary sources, because the primary source is the attestations themselves, and etymological dictionaries and research papers contain interpretations and conclusions based on these attestations. This is the same as what Wiktionary does: Wiktionary collects attestations in the form of citations from primary sources, and then makes interpretations and conclusions as to the meanings of the words and other aspects. Reconstructions are just another kind of interpretation and conclusion drawn from the data, except they're drawn from attestations of many words collectively. Hence, the question that still remains to be answered is whether Wiktionary is an etymological dictionary (secondary source with its own interpretations) or an encyclopedia/compendium of etymological research (tertiary source). Currently, Wiktionary is an etymological dictionary/secondary source as it contains its own interpretations of the data. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:27, 31 August 2015 (UTC)

Just in case, here's the page I was referring to {{w|WP:TERTIARY}}.

I'm also confusing some things myself, it's not the act of sourcing that is to be any "-ary", it is what the project is supposed to be, e.g., wikip. is supposed to be a tertiary source, wikt. is supposed to be a secondary source (well, kind of... the lexicog part at least?), as opposed to secondarily/tertiraily ''sourced'', this is where the "grade inflation" came from, '''sorry, my bad!'''

Also, I don't think there would necessarily be difference in the "grade" of a res. paper and an etyl dict. as the wikip. page seems to suggest that it's the manner of how it is being discussed that determines the "grade", e.g.,
*John Doe wrote in his book "the water is so clear and splashy..." – someone on wikt. makes the judgement that the term "water" is used to mean H2O, J. Doe then is primary source and by using this citation to assert that "water" does indeed mean H2O wikt. is a secondary source.
*But then Jane Doe mentioning a (hypothetical) protoform *wōdor (or whatever) would have to spell out that "wōdor is H2O in Proto-Whatever, because, I, Jane Doe said so." Then this becomes secondary and by quoting this wikt. is being "tertiary."

:An etymological dictionary ''can'' be a primary source, in case its editorial team advances any analyses or etymologies that are entirely new. Most that I have used mainly compile etymologies established by earlier research, however.
:This might be something dependant on the language family though… families like Indo-European or Uralic have a deep research history and there is quite a bit to be cited; but elsewhere, it might well happen that a wider etymological dictionary will be the first etymological source to treat a given language at all.
:(The arbitraryness of the language/dialect division brings up a couple difficulties here, too; if variety X had earlier been considered merely a dialect of language A, then it'll be debatable if old sources on language A will count as sources on X as well.)
:but back to reconstructions: when we're dealing with unattested protolanguages, the crucial point is the lack of lexicographical primary sources. (I'll skip edge cases like Latin or Sanskrit for now.) This means that something ''else'' has to be the primary source, and this is going to depend on what exactly we are sourcing.
:* If we want to establish a proto-Fooian word for let's say 'macaroni' having existed at all, then already someone pointing out that a set of words in Fooian languages for 'macaroni' are of common inheritance is a primary source (common inheritance necessarily requires that a PFooian word existed). Of course, this also presumes that a Fooian language family is already established. After all we presumably do not want to leave backdoors open for Proto-Worlders, Hungaro-Sumerists, everything-is-Tamil-ists, or even partisans for debated families like Hokan or Nilo-Saharan…
:* If we want to know some details about how the PFooian word should be reconstructed, someone's paper or monograph or course handout or whatever, on Fooian historical phonology or historical morphology or semantic change or whatever will be a primary source; and I suppose this holds even if they don't treat the particular word we're interested in. (After all, you don't need to list every single example out there in order to establish that e.g. French ''m-'' usually corresponds to Spanish ''m-''.)
:* If later on Jane Doe comes along to put the pieces together to state "the Proto-Fooian word for 'macaroni' is *nuduly", this would indeed be a secondary source — provided that she's not proposing new details in the process.

== Adding a collocations tab or section ==

[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/April#Collocations_section_in_entries.3F|In the past]], there has been support for listing common collocations somewhere (besides usexes, which only fit a few), such as in ====Collocations==== sections. At [[WT:RFD#sentimental_value]], it was suggested that not only collocations but also translations be provided. IMO, it might consume too much visual and byte space to list translations of collocations within entries, so I propose that we [ask the developers to] create a 'Collocations' namespace with its own tab like 'Citations'. We could also link to it using a {{temp|seeCites}}-type template in entries. In that namespace, we could list common collocations, perhaps as the glosses to translation tables to which translations could be added — I have mocked up an example at [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:goods&oldid=34155370 Talk:goods]; note that SOP translations are linked to their component parts. What do you think; would you like a <samp>Collocations:</samp> tab, a ====Collocations==== section, or neither? Should the tab or section contain translations, like at [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:goods&oldid=34155370 ''goods'']? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:44, 25 August 2015 (UTC)
:Seems like a reasonable solution to a perennial problem, at least if the default search includes the Collocations namespace. If it doesn't, we won't have helped users.

Imagine what that would look like for words like ''set'', ''take'', ''have'', ''head''.

*# German or Translingual entries where their WP habits lead them to expect English;  
*# {{temp|also}} that often leads them to FL entries;
*# alternative forms sections that go to form of entries that convey no additional information;
*# lengthy etymologies, with PIE and cognates;
*# pronunciation sections they can't use without IPA;  
*# translation tables; 
*# semantic relations headers using words that don't occur in normal speech [hypernyms, hyponyms, troponyms, meronyms]).

* Re Derived Terms vs Collocations.  A derived term would normally be a blue link term. E.g. [[mineral water]] is a derived term in the entry for [[mineral]]. A collocation is "use of English". Collocations are generally not going to be suitable as main entries, for SoP-iness. It's, for instance, knowing typical useful verb-noun collocations - such as "follow instructions", or "take aim", or "entertain a doubt". It's also about typical adjective-noun or adverb-verb collocations, etc. Words such as "wedge" would be enhanced if you could read that one "drives a wedge between" things, and so on. Word chunks that, if you know them, can make your English sound "good". However, I repeat, these are not derived terms. I am of the opinion that, by the time any Eng L2 learner is wondering about this stuff, they will already be familiar with the term Collocation, and so will be very happy to see the section, or tab, available as a resource. -- [[User: Algrif |<i>A<small>LGRIF</small></i >]][[User talk:Algrif |<span style="color:#FFD700"> talk</span>]] 15:32, 7 September 2015 (UTC)

== Gender markers in Polish adjective entries ==

{{temp|pl-adj}} currently requires a gender parameter.

== Attributive use of nouns ==

How to we tell for certain that a noun that modifies another noun is or isn't an adjective? For instance, I'm pretty sure that the word {{m|en|donkey}} in "donkey sanctuary" is just a noun, as is {{m|en|beer}} in {{m|en|beer parlour}}. An example of true adjectival usage would be welcome. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 14:57, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
: [[Wiktionary:English adjectives]] which is of course, not policy. [[Wiktionary:About English]] contains no policy that I can see on what separates an adjective from a noun used attributively. I actually don't think it's that hard and in ambiguous cases, there should be three citations which are clearly adjectival not either nominal or adjectival. For example "this desk is wood" would not count as a clear adjectival cite as it's just as easily (or more easily) identifiable as a noun than an adjective. [[User:Renard Migrant|Renard Migrant]] ([[User talk:Renard Migrant|talk]]) 15:11, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
:: It's very difficult to get a wording through a vote, though. Even people who agree that we need such a policy will oppose on the grounds of wording, so getting 70% ish approval is unlikely. [[User:Renard Migrant|Renard Migrant]] ([[User talk:Renard Migrant|talk]]) 15:12, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Would you say that {{m|en|epidemic}} in "epidemic proportions" is an adjective? It seems so to me (but I can't explain why). [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 15:55, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Yes, you're right. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epidemic]. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 17:02, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Yes, "proportions" usually takes an adj; e.g. you'd say "canine proportions", not "dog proportions". [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 17:11, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
:Apply [[Wiktionary:English adjectives#Tests_of_whether_an_English_word_is_an_adjective|tests of adjectivity]], and Occam's razor. ''Donkey'' has not (yet) been shown to be used in contexts that are clearly adjectival, like ''this sanctuary is donkeyer than that one''; ''it was very red and very donkey''. In contexts where either a noun or an adjective could work (''donkey sanctuary'' could be compared to ''noun sanctuary'' or ''improbable sanctuary''), Occam's razor suggests it's more likely to still be a noun than to have acquired a second part of speech which is peculiarly limited to only those varied contexts where the first part of speech could also be used. On the other hand, ''epidemic'' [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=epidemic&type=revision&diff=34278713&oldid=33651599 is used] in contexts where only an adjective could work, so it must be an adjective (some of the time). It's also used in contexts where only a noun could work, e.g. in the plural, hence it is also a noun. When a word that has been shown to be both an adjective and a noun is used in contexts where it could be either (like ''epidemic disease''), I think we've tended to default to the interpretation that it's an adjective unless semantics make the other interpretation more likely: e.g. the adjective is the best semantic fit in ''epidemic fraud'' (widespread fraud), while the noun would be the best fit in *''epidemic storage'' (section of a lab which stores samples of viruses that cause epidemics). But if a prime minister fakes an outbreak of disease in order to push through security measures, you could speak of "his epidemic fraud" with ''epidemic'' as a noun, just like you could mock postmodernism as "that postmodernism nonsense".

General thoughts on this:
# The reason that it's difficult to get a policy through is that there's no bright line.
# This is a particularly confusing subject for non-English speakers.  I speak English 1st and French 2nd.  French isn't big into attributive nouns.  In English, you can construct a sentence "A B", where A is an attributive noun and B is a common noun.  French you usually construct it "B de A", where A and B are nouns and "de" is the preposition "de"

== restoring [[solitary wasp]] ==

Hi,

Perhaps not the best place to post a request but I don't know another place to do it. This is a perfectly attestable expression, and my grammar, though not perfect (I'm not a native speaker) was certainly acceptable, and at least correctable if there were mistakes. Could someone bring back that entry please? I'm really fed up with the cavalier behavior of this admin, really (and not the only one). Thank you [[Special:Contributions/86.69.154.104|86.69.154.104]] 20:50, 29 August 2015 (UTC)

: Hi. Yes, it's a real phrase, but doesn't it just refer to any wasp that is solitary (i.e. not social or colony-dwelling)? Then it's obvious from the two words. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 20:59, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
::It seems that the terms ''[[solitary wasp]]'', ''[[social wasp]]'', and ''[[hunting wasp]]'' have been used as if they referred to well-defined groups, though most modern thinking would apparently have them as SoP. For example, Century 1911 has ''solitary wasp'' as a run-in at the entry for solitary. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  21:33, 29 August 2015 (UTC)

:This has been recreated, and I have rewritten it in English. However, I can't find it in any other dictionary and feel it is sum-of-parts. There are plenty of hits for the two words used together so I'm not sure that RfV would be useful. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 20:33, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::Take a look at the bottom of the entry for {{R:Century 1911|solitary}} where it is a run-in entry. I take this to mean that "the solitary wasps" was considered at least an informal grouping at that time and that the most promising source of citations would be before 1910, though the term may have continued in use past that time. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  22:23, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::I have edited the entry in line with the thoughts above, adding a dated definition with cites from the 19th century and adding {{temp|&lit|social|wasp}} to replace the previous SoP definition. Note that two of the citations are of ''Social Wasps'', the capitalization being suggestive of something other than SoPitude. The entry could be further improved or challenged, of course.

== Which English entries need pronunciation? ==

Can someone generate a list of English entries that don't have {{temp|IPA}}? But somehow sort them in order of importance? I'm not sure how we would go about that, but there are basic entries out there, like [[garbage]], which really should have the IPA pronunciation. [[User:Ultimateria|Ultimateria]] ([[User talk:Ultimateria|talk]]) 04:41, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'd like this too, though "in order of importance" is probably an unattainable goal. I've added pronunciation info at {{m|en|garbage}} now. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 06:52, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Here's a list of top 100 English entries whose English section did not contain "<nowiki>{{IPA</nowiki>" on 28 July 2014, ordered by [[Wiktionary:Frequency lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000]], not constrained to lemmas, based on 20140728 dump: <small>said, no, de, hands, Gutenberg, english, 2, replied, united, john, looking, coming, making, sn, arms, followed, appeared, continued, ety, reached, suddenly, miles, taking, beyond, nearly, laws, comes, natural, laid, copyright, opened, an', 4, makes, tried, Dr, lived, certainly, unto, placed, letters, remained, blockquote, happened, minutes, loved, knows, donations, thoughts, including, filled, seeing, tears, places, raised, moved, giving, laughed, leaving, started, circumstances, c., lines, considered, observed, wished, Charles, formed, trying, allowed, girls, discovered, sitting, ways, officers, offered, happiness, produced, walls, declared, prepared, takes, soldiers, talking, steps, intended, matters, appears, closed, gives, required, ladies, fixed, troops, camp, copies, v., running, cases, names.</small>

If you want to have the list constrained to lemmas, let me know. Basically, let me know:
* a) How many items you want
* b) Whether you want to constrain to lemmas
* c) To what location do you want the list delivered, like someone's talk page, some subpage, or the like

The process is rather simple, based on a dump. The key part is identifying English sections that do not contain "<nowiki>{{IPA</nowiki>". This is done using the following script find-missing-English-IPA.py:
<syntaxhighlight lang=Python>
import sys, re
entryStartFound = False
IPAFound = False
title = ""
for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
  line = line.rstrip()
  if "<title>" in line: title = re.sub(" *</?title> *", "", line)
  if entryStartFound:
    if "{{IPA" in line or "{{audio-IPA" in line: IPAFound = True
    if "----" in line or "</text>" in line:
      entryStartFound = False      
      if not IPAFound: print title
      IPAFound = False
  if "==English==" in line: entryStartFound = True
</syntaxhighlight>
The rest is intersecting the result with the frequency list in such order that the result is sorted by frequency list. The process was as follows:
* find-missing-English-IPA.py enwiktionary-20140728-pages-articles.xml >English-entries-with-no-IPA.txt
* grep -Fx -f English-entries-with-no-IPA.txt frequency-list-English-PG-10000.txt >t.txt
*: That's a set intersection, but the order of files matter.
* head -100 t.txt
*: Output the first 100 lines
You need Python, grep and head. You probably do not really need head, since you can pick the top 100 in your favorite editor. grep is used to do set intersection; if you have another method, you don't need grep.

== Welcome ==
{{welcome}} --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:07, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

== Syllable counting ==

The number of syllables in English is not always reliable based on syllabification. —<span class="Latf" style="font-size: 100%">[[User:JohnC5|John]][[User talk:JohnC5|C5]]</span> 19:36, 25 August 2016 (UTC)

: The number of syllables in any language is always reliable based on syllabification. That is what syllabification is defined to be. I agree it might not be the same as hyphenation. [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]])
:: That is unfortunately not the case for stress-timed languages. See the discussion [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2016/February#Proposal: "Category:English trisyllabic words" and similar categories|here]]. —<span class="Latf" style="font-size: 100%">[[User:JohnC5|John]][[User talk:JohnC5|C5]]</span> 20:08, 25 August 2016 (UTC)

== Request for guidance ==
I simply want to mark English words by the number of syllables so it will be easier to teach friends who are learning English.  Apparently boldly creating the categories is not the way to do it, as they were deleted in less than a day.
(I don't know why there wasn't a Request for Deletion, just a bold deletion.}
How do I accomplish what I want to do ? {{unsigned|Bcent1234}}
:Greetings. See [[:Category:English words by number of syllables]] for multiple syllable categories. I populated them per your request. Unfortunately, the categories for 1 and 2 syllables are poorly populated, because the entries themselves are lacking the correct syllable markers. They may be fixed by adding the dot (.) and stress marker (ˈ) in the {{temp|IPA}} template wherever they are needed.
:The categories for 3 or more syllables seem to be OK. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:52, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

:: Daniel, I note that https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/no doesn't get categorized as 1 syllable. Is that because it uses a complex template instead of just IPA ? [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:30, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::: The entry [[no]] is using a separate template called {{temp|audio-IPA}}. You are correct, that template was not categorizing entries by their syllables, but now it is. The entry [[no]] should be categorized as 1 syllable now. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:17, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::  Also, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acrid#Pronunciation and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adage#Pronunciation doesn't get categorized as 2 syllables. even though it uses the IPA template. I don't understand [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:39, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

:::I changed the category names for 1 and 2 syllable words in English. See [[:Category:English supposedly 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English supposedly 2-syllable words]].
:::The older categories ([[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]]) are being automatically emptied at the moment; it will take some time before they are completely empty. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:19, 9 September 2016 (UTC)


== Primary stress ==

Re a few of your recent edits: you can't have two primary stress markers (ˈ) in one pronunciation. You can use the secondary stress marker (ˌ) or the syllable marker (.) for the remaining syllables. [[User:Keith the Koala|Keith the Koala]] ([[User talk:Keith the Koala|talk]]) 07:34, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

: You ''can'' have two primary stresses in one pronunciation, although it's very rare in single words. The difference is secondary stress is literally less stressed than the primary stress, while two primary stresses are equally stressed. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 10:19, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

== Secondary stress marks ==

These aren't the same as syllable boundaries. Please stop adding them, because you don't understand what you're doing. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 19:26, 11 September 2016 (UTC)
:Maybe you mean to add periods (.), which are used to delineate syllable boundaries where there is nothing to note about stress. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 19:39, 11 September 2016 (UTC)
::I do want to delineate syllable boundaries. I will use a period (.) instead of a ˌ [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 19:43, 11 September 2016 (UTC)
:::In general, if you have a poor understanding of IPA, you should ask before making changes that are actually incorrect and requiring me to waste my time undoing them. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 19:49, 11 September 2016 (UTC)
:::: Actually I did ask about IPA, and no mention was made that there were two separate marks. Perhaps the documentation for the IPA template should be updated. [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:00, 11 September 2016 (UTC)

==Entry layout==
Please put the pronunciation section just before the noun/adj/whatever section. For example, ...[[example]]. See [[WT:ELE]] for more detail. [[User:Ultimateria|Ultimateria]] ([[User talk:Ultimateria|talk]]) 16:03, 13 September 2016 (UTC)

== IPA issues again ==

Please don't use /a/. Here are the symbols we use on Wiktionary for phonemic transcriptions of English: [[Appendix:English pronunciation]]. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 18:24, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
:: You said: ''Please don't use /a/.'' on my talk page. Could you show me where I used it? I really doubt I did as I usually simply copy pronunciations and add syllable markers. I'd be glad to fix it. [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 18:38, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
:: is it possible that you were talking about https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=anthroposphere ? The a in the IPA has been there since the article was created in 2008. I only copied the pronunciation to the plural form and added the syllable markers. Could you guide me in what should be used? 18:53, 16 September 2016 (UTC)

: ɘ is not a schwa! Be careful! [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 18:26, 16 September 2016 (UTC)

: The "long schwa" you added at [[ambivert]] is wrong for that vowel too. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 18:27, 16 September 2016 (UTC)

:: I assume the long schwa you referred to on my talk page is where a schwa is followed by the faint colon (I don't know its name). In tracing back, that pronunciation has been on that page since the pronunciation was first added in 2010. I'm simply adding syllabification, but if it helps us review the pronunciation, I don't mind being the scapegoat. It makes wiktionary more accurate.

== Category links ==

Hi there, please add category links only at the bottom of the language section, makes them easier to find, see the following page for more info: [[Wiktionary:Entry_layout#Category_links|Entry layout - Category links]]. Thanks! – [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 17:23, 28 November 2016 (UTC)
: it's a bit late to tell me your preference. I am sorry, but I will not comply with your request. I have made several thousand by now, and this is the first mention of your preference. I always place the syllable count at the end of the Pronunciation section. That is the easiest way for auditors to see it, and compare the count of syllables with the EnPr or IPA pronunciation. Alternately, I place it after the English tag.  When there is no Pronunciation section, I will comply with your preference and move it to the bottom of the language section, before any tag for the next language, if it exists. [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 17:45, 28 November 2016 (UTC)

::: I am concerned about the auditability of putting the category for the number of syllables in a place other than the Pronunciation section. Will this make the work of a reviewer too onerous ? [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:29, 28 November 2016 (UTC)
:::: I agree that it's easier to handle if related information is bundled together. However it's also important to have consistent formatting across entries. The only solution I could think of would be to have the category be generated by a template/module placed in the pronunciation section. – [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 02:33, 30 November 2016 (UTC)

== Overlinking ==

I have undone [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=tooth&diff=prev&oldid=41861397 this edit] at [[tooth]].  Words in quotations should not be linked per [[WT:EL]].  I also think that is a bad case of overlinking in any case.  You seem to be doing a lot of that, but I'm not sure that it is helpful to link that many words in an entry.  Better to judiciously choose words that may be unfamiliar to the reader, or are being used with an unusual meaning.

== Votes on EL ==

Hey.
I think all of them need to be renamed to something more comprehensible.
[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Language|This one-word vote]] is an example.
For future users ya know.--[[User:Giorgi Eufshi|Giorgi Eufshi]] ([[User talk:Giorgi Eufshi|talk]]) 11:33, 5 January 2016 (UTC)
:I don't know, that could be a good idea. But only a few of those didn't start yet and I wouldn't want to rename them after they already started.
:I chose the name "language" because it's the language policy. It's the explanation of "language" in all entries. A longer name could be "Entry layout: Language section", I think. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 12:15, 5 January 2016 (UTC)
::I won't rename them unilaterally, but you can create a discussion at [[WT:RFM]] about that to see what others think. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 12:16, 5 January 2016 (UTC)

Is [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Template:sort:%E4%B8%80/ja Template:sort:一/ja] a project that got anywhere? —[[User:suzukaze-c|suzukaze]] ([[User talk:suzukaze-c|t]]・[[Special:Contributions/suzukaze-c|c]]) 05:21, 20 January 2016 (UTC)
:No, I probably just created that one template, but I think it's obvious I had some kind of "auto-sorting of Japanese kanji" in mind. Which would be the work of a module nowadays. I took the liberty of deleting that template. The full contents of the template were: "一00". --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 10:50, 20 January 2016 (UTC)

== Reordering L3 headers ==

({{ping|-sche}}, as I believe this is of interest to you.) I think that a major long-running criticism of Wiktionary is how difficult it is to find the information one is looking for. A good way to deal with this would be colour-coding, which some other language Wiktionaries use to some degree, but I expect that'd get a poor reception among Wiktionarians here, so a less aggressive approach would be to push Alternative forms (and maybe Pronunciation) after the definitions except when sorted by multiple etymologies where those sections apply to all etymologies, or something along those lines.

: Angr (IIRC) has pointed out that one difference between how we present etymologies vs how other dictionaries do is that ours have big headers that take up a lot of space. A reason for putting alternative forms at the top of entries is to confirm to people that they've reached the right word, when e.g. they spell it ''kinnikinnik'' but our main entry is ''kinnikinnick'', or when there are UK vs NZ vs etc differences... but the "Alternative forms" header usually (not at ''kinnikinnick'', but usually) takes up more space than the one or two alt forms themselves. There's wasted space to the right of all the headers. Other online dictionaries tend to fill that space, e.g. putting inflection info that we put on the headword line next to the POS declaration, or putting pronunciation info there. If we could do that, resulting in an appearence like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Sandbox&oldid=36866793 this], it might be an improvement, separate from any re-arrangement of headers. It would require us to eschew ===This type of header=== for those sections, though. De.Wikt does eschew ===These=== for unimportant headers &mdash; though they leave all the empty whitespace to the right of the pseudo-headers &mdash; so we know it's doable and doesn't make entries too hard to edit.
: We could also streamline pronunciation sections by making the IPA the link to the audio file. One entries that had only a few pronunciations, the pronunciation section could fit on a single line. This is how other online dictionaries do it.
: I don't like the idea of colours, unless you mean only to colour all the POS headers with the same neutral colour like de.Wikt does. Using different colours for different sections would be an accessibility issue (for colourblind people), and colouring the entire section would be visually unpleasant / distracting (garish), in my view.

:: I like how French Wiktionary formats their headings. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:41, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
:::* Comparing between the POS header styles of dewikt and frwikt, I like the latter more. I'd probably support using that format here.
:::* I support placing "Alternative forms" after the definitions. One reason is: "Alternative forms" are very similar to "Synonyms", to the extent that I've seen occasionally the same word linked in both headers in the same entry.

*Overall, the French style seems better than what we do, I agree. The reason I'm leaving this here is (as usual) laziness; I care about this issue, but I don't know how much effort in BP discussions or polling will be necessary until a vote on it can be created, so I am not especially eager to get the ball rolling on that myself, and I'm hoping one of you will do that soon. By the way, another idea that has been floated before is autocollapsed etymologies, but I'm not sold on that yet. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 16:13, 28 January 2016 (UTC)

== propose a vote to rename (1) i -> q; (2) italbrac -> qualifier q; (3) qualifier -> q? ==

Hi, since you've been proposing lots of votes lately I wonder if you'd be willing to propose another one along the vein of the {{temp|term}} -> {{temp|m}} and {{temp|cx}} -> {{temp|lb}} change. This was originally suggested by [[User:CodeCat]] but I agree with the gist of it. Basically, {{temp|i}} and the longer-form {{temp|italbrac}} are synonyms for {{temp|q}}/{{temp|qual}}/{{temp|qualifier}}, but have sub-optimal names because the names suggest a specific formatting convention (italics + paren) when they really are intended to have a sort of semantic function. So I'd suggest a 4-part vote:

# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|i}} -> {{temp|q}}
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|italbrac}} -> {{temp|qualifier}} (or to {{temp|q}} if part 3 passes)
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|qualifier}} -> {{temp|q}}
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|qual}} -> {{temp|q}}

I imagine (1) and (2) will pass easily; I'm not sure about (3) or (4) since some people have voiced objections to the shorter names and there are already bots that try to rename {{temp|i}} to {{temp|qualifier}}.

:Sure, I don't mind creating the vote page for this. Should we create a BP (or maybe a GP) discussion right now to get feedback from other people? Are there any other discussions about this move? If the answer is yes, then I should link to the discussions from the vote.
:I'd like to get one thing out of the way: I don't know if other people would rather use RFM than a vote. IMO, a vote would be the better option in this case, because this change involves a major template. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 14:41, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

== Wikisaurus and link parameter ==

Years ago, you wanted {{tl|ws}} and {{tl|ws header}} use link= parameter while I insisted on hyperlink= parameter. Given recent trends in short template names supported by a supermajority in [[Wiktionary:Votes/2015-11/term → m; context → label; usex → ux]], and given how easy to understand link= seems to be:

Switching {{tl|ws}} and {{tl|ws header}} to link= (while keeping hyperlink= for compatibility with old page revisions) seems to be in order.

What do you think? Would you change the templates to support the short link= form? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:49, 21 February 2016 (UTC)

:{{ping|Dan Polansky}}: Sorry, I left your message unaswered for quite a long time.
:Regardless of what my opinions were years ago, what I think now is this:
:Yes, in my opinion "link=" is much better than "hyperlink=". But I'd rather use {{temp|ws|word|link=-}} with an hyphen there, to make it clear that the parameter "link" is doing ''something''. To someone unacquainted with the template, it is not obvious that the "link=" (or "hyperlink=") in {{temp|ws|word|link=}} has any meaning.
:Yes, I would change the templates to support the short link= form and would keep hyperlink= for compatibility with old page revisions.
:What do you think about using "|link=-" with the hyphen?
:In order to prepare for the change, I populated [[:Category:ws header unlinked]] and [[:Category:ws unlinked]] with the pages that are going to be affected. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 17:49, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

::* When you saw any category like [[:Category:Finnish redlinks]] with terms appearing or disappearing, it was because I was testing [[Module:redlink category]] and [[Template:redlink category]] to see if it was possible to populate all redlinks categories at once.
::* I checked the code of {{temp|fi-form of}} and I don't think the order of parameters should change whether an entry is categorized in [[:Category:Finnish redlinks]]. That template uses {{temp|m}} to link to your example word "parempi" and that always makes the redlink to be categorized if "parempi" is a redlink. Probably the entries just appeared and disappeared when you checked because I was coincidentally fiddling with the redlink template/module at the time.
::* At some point I made a mistake that caused entries like {{m|en|Abyssinian}}, {{m|en|aardvark}} and {{m|fi|viitisenkymmentä}} to be categorized too, but that was quickly fixed.
::* Turns out if I populate the categories for ''all'' languages, it causes module errors in about 200 entries (as far as I know) with many links, like [[language]], [[water]] and [[eye]]. Apparently I can populate a few categories without generating any errors, so I populated only [[:Category:Portuguese redlinks]], [[:Category:Italian redlinks]] and [[:Category:Russian redlinks]].

:# It does everything {{temp|prefix}} and {{temp|suffix}} do, plus it accepts interfixes like [[-i-]].
:# If I want to just say "-er" without specifying the previous parameter, I can choose between {{temp|suffix|en||er}} and {{temp|affix|en|-er}}. The latter is simpler, because I don't have to use the 1st parameter as an empty parameter. I can simply use "-er" as the 1st parameter and the template recognizes that it is a suffix because of the hyphen.

: How do you see entries like [[smaaart]], [[niiice]], etc. actually helping any real human being with the English language?

But for a learner, imagine a learner seeing this and thinking "oh, so ''niiice'' is an English word that I can use!"; this will make them write weird, strange English and fail essays. I don't know the correct solution here, but I feel we should be explaining somehow (WikiGrammar, a new project?) "you can repeat a letter to suggest a long, extended vocal pronunciation" rather than creating entries for every possible case. It's a bit like "leet" hackerspeak: you can write d0g, b0g, w0g for [[dog]], [[bog]], [[wog]], but this is done by a rule from the original spelling, and they aren't usefully separate words.

I mean, you already know the word ''nice''; you say it in a drawn-out, sarcastic way (step 2); and then someone tries to write down what you said, to capture the sarcasm (step 3). I feel as though some of this stuff is... I wanted to say grammar, but it's not. Let's say "extralexical". The wiki family does have a gap for something that would tell us about grammar rules (French ''ne...pas'', English inversion [''should he wish to do it''], etc.) and stuff like snowclones, but it doesn't seem to fit in mainspace. I suppose appendices are as good a place as any, for now. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 01:53, 5 May 2016 (UTC)

:(e/c) In my opinion, replacing instances of nocap with notext, adding the text manually into the entry where necessary, could work as a step in the direction of removing the "Borrowing from" text altogether from the template. I saw your comment in [[WT:RFM#Template:borrowing]] and I support and agree with it: "We could get rid of the text from the template altogether, and add it manually to the entries instead. Then it would work like {{temp|der}} and {{temp|inh}}, which don't include text either." I consider it an annoying inconsistency that {{temp|bor}} currently returns "borrowing from" while {{temp|inh}} and {{temp|der}} do ''not'' return "inherited from" and "derived from", respectively. In fact, I've seen many entries, with code like "<nowiki>{{bor|it|en}} and {{der|it|fr}}</nowiki>", which apparently means "borrowed from English and French" but the second template was {{temp|der}} (or {{temp|etyl}}), likely to avoid showing up "borrowing from" twice or the need to use "notext=1".
:That said, I believe [[:Category:bor with nocap]] is important, because I'd like to know what are the entries that use "a borrowing from". In most other cases, (that is, when you just use {{temp|bor|xx|yy|word}}, and it is not in the middle of a sentence), I believe "Borrowed from X" is the best option. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 14:56, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

:: There seem to be a fair number of (mostly Latvian?) entries that use <code>nocap=</code> just so that they can say "A borrowing" instead, which is rather silly.

:I'm not finished with the code for letter categories yet. Should I create something like [[Template:letter cat]] (together with [[Module:letter cat]]) and make [[Template:auto cat]] provide the parameters to the letter template? That could be done, but it feels to me like an unnecessary duplication. In the long term, I think it would be nice deleting {{temp|poscatboiler}}, {{temp|charactercat}}, etc. (like {{temp|affixcatboiler}} and a few others were deleted in the past) IMO, we don't need the other templates if just {{temp|auto cat}} is able to do all the work.

== Letter categories ==

The idea as such is pretty good, but are we going to end up for thousands of categories for all of the Chinese characters too? Also, you may want to modify {{temp|charactercat}} to categorise it in there somehow, but again you'll end up with thousands of them. See [[:Category:Japanese terms by their individual characters]]... —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 23:05, 27 July 2016 (UTC)
:Thanks for saying that the idea as such is pretty good. But I feel that what I'm currently doing is different than what {{temp|charactercat}} is doing. We can still use {{temp|charactercat}}, but it would have to be adapted somehow.
:I created {{temp|charactercat}}, [[:CAT:Japanese terms by their individual characters]] and [[:CAT:English terms by their individual characters]] a few years ago. As I know you're aware, they are about categorizing entries that contains certain characters. And the Japanese version already has 4,264 subcategories.
:Today I created these categories: [[:Category:Aa]], [[:Category:Áá]], [[:Category:Bb]], etc. They are about categorizing appendices listing the letters of a certain language, like [[Appendix:Letters/English]], [[Appendix:Letters/Portuguese]]—and possibly [[Appendix:Letters/Dutch]] in the future.
:As it stands, we have:
:* [[:CAT:English terms spelled with É]] => contains entries like [[café]] and [[fiancée]]
:* [[:CAT:Éé]] => contains [[Appendix:Letters/Portuguese]] and [[Appendix:Letters/Spanish]]
:I'm still trying to figure out what would be the best category tree. [[:CAT:English terms spelled with É]] should probably be a member of [[:CAT:Éé]].

(Like, the page may have good formatting at the time but in 10 years it may not have some new templates that most other entries are using: an "ideal" page would use {{temp|etyl}} at some point, today I'd prefer {{temp|der}}. Also, we can't guarantee it's not missing senses, languages, quotations, images for multiple senses and pronunciations for multiple dialects, which are not layout issues but in some way they make the entry less worthy of being called "ideal".)

(which is sensible) I even added a conspicuous note in both categories, warning that if people want to see proper categorization, they must fix the entries first by adding proper syllable separators. This is a problem of the thousands of the entries lacking syllable markers, not the module. So I'm suggesting having separate (cleanup) categories for entries that are automatically recognized as having 1 or 2 syllables, because in fact they often have 3 or more syllables. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 19:43, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::: This is a problem with the module having incorrect expectations of the IPA transcriptions.

Saying: "English syllabification is not well-defined" makes it sound that even a smarter module would be completely hopeless. Either way, what I suggested still stands. We could have these ''empty'' categories: [[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]] (and possibly [[:Category:English 3-syllable words]]), and [[Module:IPA]] could populate separate hidden categories with all the obvious mistakes.

:::::::: How would the module know which ones are mistakes and which ones not? I oppose having any of this code in the live module until we know it works. As for syllabification, the least-defined aspect of English syllabification is to which syllable a consonant belongs, which is irrelevant if what you are doing is counting syllables. It is of course possible to try to count the vowels and diphthongs, but it's not something you're going to get right on the first try, which is why I'm urging you to use a test module and create test cases. The other tricky thing, which we've already discussed is ambiguous cases like ''file'' and ''filing'', which you had mentioned you wanted to categorize as both. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:14, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::: If in the future I decide trying to make the module count vowels and digraphs, then yes, I'll use a test module. Making a smarter module was not my idea, though. I was just basically going to count the "." in each entry, which is why I had considered the module finished.
::::::::: Re: "How would the module know which ones are mistakes and which ones not?" -- see my answer from 19:02, 9 September 2016 (UTC). I just said I was going to change the category names, not that the module would be able to recognize right from wrong somehow. I already started to populate the [[:Category:English supposedly 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English supposedly 2-syllable words]]. Feel free to suggest different names for these categories.
::::::::: Even if it's impossible to separate syllables accurately for many English words, there are many ''other'' English words like [[alchemist]] that currently have no syllable markers and would benefit if someone added the markers. That's one reason why having the "supposedly" categories is useful, in my opinion.
::::::::: About [[file]]: my idea was to categorize it in a separate category named [[:Category:English 1- or 2-syllable words]]. I mentioned we could use a separate template for that, like possibly {{temp|syllables|fi?le}} (1 or 2 syllables), as opposed to {{temp|syllables|fi-le}} (2 syllables). Still if we can do that using only {{temp|IPA}}, the separate template would just duplicate content.
::::::::: If all English words had syllable markers, then [[file]] could have {{temp|IPA|/xxyy/|/xx.yy/|lang=en}} to show both separations of syllables. The module would then categorize it into both [[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]]; but the module could be changed to categorize the entry into [[:Category:English 1- or 2-syllable words]] instead. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:08, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::: I oppose having "supposedly" categories or any other name for these categories. If the content of the categories is not correct, then they are not ready to be live. Why would [[alchemist]] benefit from syllabification? The whole thing I'm trying to say is that syllabification is a mostly meaningless concept in English. {{temp|IPA|/xxyy/|/xx.yy/|lang=en}} is simply wrong, because it's not as though there are two distinct pronunciations of ''file'', but that the same pronunciation of ''file'' can be counted as either having one or two syllables. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:27, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::: "Why would [[alchemist]] benefit from syllabification?" -- {{ping|Bcent1234}} asked for it and is willing to add syllabification in entries. Is that a service we cannot provide? It bothers me that some entries have the separation of syllables and others don't have it.
::::::::::: I wonder if, in English-speaking countries, kids in English class in are taught to separate syllables, and if Wiktionary could help with it. In Brazil, any Portuguese textbook for a given age has exercises to group words into: "proparoxítona", "paroxítona", "oxítona", "monossílaba", "dissílaba", "trissílaba" and "polissílaba" and dictionaries often separate syllables of all words. Visit http://michaelis.uol.com.br and search for an English word; it will show the separation of syllables. (it counts "file" as having only 1 syllable) --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:41, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Who would add this {{temp|syllables}} template and what would it do? If all it does it count syllables, why not just manually add categories? If there is a meaningful syllabification, it can be shown in the IPA transcription, but it is not guaranteed that we can do this for every word. In my school, we were not taught to separate syllables. It is a useless skill when it comes to English (and other West Germanic languages), even though it may be useful in Portuguese and other romance languages (and in Russian and other Slavic languages). I'd imagine that if English schools were to do this, they'd use the orthographic syllables (i.e. hyphenation) and not the actual spoken syllables. The dictionary you link to is also just showing the hyphenation. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:08, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

: {{ping|Bcent1234}}: You're welcome. You don't need to learn IPA to help taking care of the mis-classified words.
: Please see [[acceptableness]] as an example of an entry with correct syllable separation. The page has a "Pronunciation" section with a template called {{temp|IPA}}, which separates syllables using a dot (.) character between all syllables.
: Please try to fix [[aggregate]]. You can do this by adding a dot (.) between all syllables in the IPA template. When you find either of the two stress markers ( ˈ and ˌ ), please place the dot behind it ( .ˈ and .ˌ ), even though the entries would be categorized the same without the dot behind it.
: There are thousands of entries that need to be fixed in [[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]], so feel free to work on some of them if you are interested.

== Edit Filter ==

I think your edit filter needs more work: the main source of the offending syntax is from substing gone wrong, and since you can't see substed text until you save the edit and then look at the wikitext, a very likely scenario is someone clicking "save changes" and having no clue why the system stops them- even if they preview the edit, they won't be able to see anything out of the ordinary. What's more, there will be no trace in the edit history for anyone who tries to help them- only the abuse log will show what went wrong, and most won't think to look there.

Please try to come up with an abuse-filter message to explain the error. Otherwise, you're going to be punishing good-faith contributors without giving them a chance to learn from their mistakes, and causing frustration at the Grease Pit when people try to troubleshoot an invisible, non-repeatable error. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 03:54, 12 October 2016 (UTC)
:I understand. For the record, we are talking about [[Special:AbuseFilter/56]]. It was my first edit filter. I tweaked it and now it shows the standard warning [[MediaWiki:Abusefilter-warning]] and it does not ''prevent'' the edit to be published, but it tags the offending entry with "triple-braces" tag. Is that not enough? Coming up with a specific abuse filter message would solve this problem? I think I could create a separate template with: "Warning: This entry contains triple braces {{{ }}}, which are usually the result of an error when [[mw:Manual:Substitution|substing]]." --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 04:17, 12 October 2016 (UTC)

:::::: Yes, it is offensive and I won't forgive it, because it does not have a reasonable rationale behind it. I can forgive something based on solid arguments, but this is not.<br />First of all, it would be correct by CodeCat to ping us in the post in Beer parlour, so we would know about that section there and could react. Second: none of the reverters ever mentioned to us the "descriptiveness" you mention now, fortiori pointed us to any relevant page where it is clearly and unambiguously described. Third: describing - at least in Czech - means to show the reality as it is. So the reality is, that the disputed spellings are incorrect and not considered as alternative. Paradoxically those, who use them, consider them rather correct spelling and the real correct spelling as misspelling, but nobody considers these pairs as alternatives to each other. The fact that somebody does not know or respect orthography of the language doesn't constitute his creations to be "alternative". Fourth: By keeping the "alternative spelling" instead of "mmisspelling" you (plural) are telling to people (mostly foreigners) that they ''can'' use such form. But that is not true. They are not supposed to, because those are not correct forms but misspellings both by definition and morphology. So you (plural) give heavily misleading information. And last but not least: Even hundred times repeated incorrectness won't become correct. Nobody can not change reality by pushing his/her POV which does not ''describe'' it. If you (plural) are OK with keeping factual mistakes on English Wiktionary, then it's your (plural) choice, but it devalues the English Wiktionary as a whole then.<br />In any case your (plural) behavior to de facto newcomers is very unwelcoming and instead of helping out with explaining and pointing to explanatory places you (plural) simply blindly revert without stating a reason or even protect.

:{{Re|Daniel Carrero}} Just a piece of advice: You better not trust Danny B. Yes, he was a long time admin on cs.wiktionary but only because there were no admin vote rules and for the users it was nearly impossible to make him resign. And for the record, he was repeatedly and by many users asked to have his adminship confirmed or to resign but he blatantly ignored all such requests. After our community finally had admin vote rules and he was forced to confirm his adminship, he totally [[:cs:Wikislovník:Správci/Potvrzení práv správce Danny B.|failed in doing so]]. He was never voted to be a bureaucrat and stays him only because we have no bureaucrat vote rules.

Well, since Auvajs pulled the local dirt here, I have to put it in the context then:
# At first, it should be mentioned that Auvajs is massive (talking about many tens) sockpuppetter on several projects, banned from the Czech Wikipedia because of that. Even nowadays he is still using various accounts.
# Auvajs has personal antipathy to most of the admmins on Czech projects, simply because they are trying to enforce him to follow the rules which sometimes involves blocks.
# Auvajs has been banned for trolling in the form of taking quarrels from one project to the other. The post above and his recent contributions are clear evidence of trying to do the same here.
# Auvajs drove by his aggressive and offensive behavior many productive users off the project for good, which is also a reason why the confirmation he linked ended up such way.
# None of his statements above about myself not being voted are true, which is easily provable by checking the history of the project as well as considering the simple and obvious fact that stewards would not promote someone not voted.
Anyway, ''none of the things mentioned above are relevant'' to the current disputes of whether some words should be called alternative spelling or misspelling, so I would actually kindly suggest to remove this part of this section completely to prevent deployment of totally irrelevant discussion.<br />— [[User:Danny B.|Danny B.]] 01:09, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

And you call it "enforcing to follow the rules" ? Pathetic. 3) I was banned indef by a friend of Danny B. on cs.wikisource after I posted a question to the local village pump if the site had any admin vote rules. If the site had admin votes rules they'd lose their rights so they banned me indef so that I couldn't make an effort to create them and they hold their rights forever.  See [[:meta:Requests for comment/cs.wikisource admins]]. 4) The truth is, most of Danny's supporters voted for him despite being long time inactive or very little active on the project. 5) So please provide evidence on the vote for you becoming cs.wiktionary bureaucrat :) --[[User:Auvajs|Auvajs]] ([[User talk:Auvajs|talk]]) 01:42, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

Per {{diff|41152300}}, you removed a certain series of posts based on an email request by Danny B.

Since to me, it seems inappropriate that posts of one user are removed based on an email request by another user.

To complete the picture, Danny B. is a non-consensual admin (as witnessed by his volume removals of images) making almost no substantive contribution on any project of Wikimedia foundations. Recently, we was desysopped from the Czech Wiktionary as per [[:cs:Wikislovník:Správci/Potvrzení práv správce Danny B.]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:47, 15 October 2016 (UTC)

After you sent me this message, I re-read some sections in [[w:Wikipedia:User pages]] (especially sections "Removal of comments, notices, and warnings" and "Deletion of user talk pages"), which is not our policy, but may serve as an additional reference.

::: Short answer: Yes. Longer explanation: But [[WT:NORM]] was created as a result of [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Voting on normalization of entries|this discussion]] from May 2015 with 13 polls, then one [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries|vote]] that failed on July 2015, but finally served to create [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-07/Normalization of entries 2|this]] other vote that passed on September 2015. Later, it was revised by a few other votes, including [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-11/NORM: 10 proposals|this big one]] with 10 proposals, that ended on February 2016. So [[WT:NORM]] is pretty solid. Even if we find any inconsistencies between the old policy and [[WT:NORM]], these discussions and votes are my reason to believe that we should, naturally, follow NORM.
::: Some things that were in [[Wiktionary:Wikitext style]] but don't exist in [[WT:NORM]] nowadays include deprecated practices like linking all language names on translation tables that are ''not'' part of a "TOP40" list of major languages, and using separate gender templates: {{temp|m}} for masculine and {{temp|f}} for feminine. The old policy also included this rule: "In general, if a definition is a complete sentence, it should start with a capital and end with a period. If it is a word, list of words, or a phrase, it should not." but this is controversial to say the least, so it was mentioned in the aforementioned discussions and was hence removed (also if we ''had'' a rule like this, it would be covered in [[WT:EL]], not [[WT:NORM]], because it affects how the entries are presented to our readers) --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:23, 27 October 2016 (UTC)

==AWB edits to character boxes==

:Hello. As I had proposed in [[WT:RFDO#Template:character info]], my intention is basically deleting all templates like {{temp|Egyptian Hieroglyphs character info}}, {{temp|Combining Diacritical Marks character info}}, etc. The idea is using only {{temp|character info/new}}, which fills most parameters automatically. From what I saw, apparently many pages didn't have the <code>previous=</code> and <code>next=</code> parameters filled, but {{temp|character info/new}} fills that information automatically. A few had incorrect information like in [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%84&curid=3581975&diff=41558711&oldid=41509037 this diff].
:I'm also consistently placing all the charboxes as the first thing on the page, before {{temp|also}} and before any language sections. When the charbox is above all language sections, like {{temp|also}}, it appears no matter what language you are seeing if you have TabbedLanguages enabled. When {{temp|also}} is above a charbox, there's a blank space above the charbox, which I'd like to avoid.

== Complete Wiktionary? ==

Hi, I'm relatively new to Wiktionary and I was taking my first look through the beer parlour. You mentioned that in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2016/November#Favicon proposal]] that you wanted Wiktionary to be completed by the end of this year. Frankly, I'm kind of amazed and I just want to talk about it a little to get a sense of what completeness means. It's really cool that it could be complete! I've always just assumed that Wikimedia projects are an endless work in progress, but I guess everything has to finish eventually. How does one tell if Wiktionary is complete, and what happens when it is complete? Is it really realistic to finish before 2017? [[User:Icebob99|Icebob99]] ([[User talk:Icebob99|talk]]) 20:32, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|Icebob99}}: Actually, I was being sarcastic -- sometimes, people make jokes like saying "I'm going away from Wiktionary for a few weeks, please try to complete Wiktionary before I come back", but Wiktionary appears to be an endless work in progress, as you said. Setting aside the fact that new words and expressions are coined all the time, we would have to cover all words and expressions in all languages already created up to this point in time, with their etymologies, pronunciations, translations, etc. The entry [[water]] has translations in hundreds of languages, and basically all or most other entries should have translations in hundreds of languages too, I believe. Plus, all requests like "check current translations" and "clean up these entries" would have to be fulfilled too. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 20:48, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

==  [[:Category:Han script characters]] and halfwidth/fulllwidth characters ==

Why is {{temp|character info/new}} sorting a bunch of "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms" characters into [[:Category:Han script characters]]? —[[User:Suzukaze-c|suzukaze]] ([[User talk:Suzukaze-c|t]]・[[Special:Contributions/suzukaze-c|c]]) 16:49, 1 December 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|suzukaze-c}}: Apparently, this [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module:scripts/data&diff=24535418&oldid=24531004 edit] caused halfwidth and fullwidth characters (from fullwidth "!" to halfwidth circle) to be recognized as Hani characters. I removed that edit now, and this fixed the categorization. I'm pretty sure that when we had separate full/halfwidth entries, this caused the {{temp|head}} of these entries to be formatted as "Hani" automatically. The old entries were not categorized into any "X script categories" , because they did not have {{temp|character info/new}}. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 02:23, 2 December 2016 (UTC)

:Allright. Can you tell me what characters, or groups of characters would you remove from that category? :If anything, I'd like to keep punctuation marks, including the ones that are used in multiple scripts.

:Allright. Are there any other entries with problems like that? All my edits in etymologies with the "term cleanup" summary are supposed to improve the entries, and they are very similar. I replaced "etyl" by "der" and added "From" because the etym was starting with a language name.

== Wanted entries -- 出て来る ==

I just saw {{diff|41829959|text=your recent addition to Wanted Entries}}.  Generally speaking, in Japanese, if a verb in a group of verbs ends in ''-te'', it's independent.  {{lang|ja|出て来る}} is just {{m|ja|出て|tr=dete}}, the ''-te'' conjunctive conjugation of {{m|ja|出る|tr=deru||to come or go out, to exit, to move outwardly}}, followed by {{m|ja|来る|tr=kuru||to come, to move towards the speaker}} → “to come out”.  This is not a lexical item, but simply two words next to each other.  This construction could just as well be {{m|ja|出て}}{{m|ja|行く|tr=dete iku||to go out}}, or {{m|ja|落ちて}}{{m|ja|来る|tr=ochite kuru||to fall towards the speaker}}, or {{m|ja||帰って拾って連れて行って見てもらって寝かした|tr=kaette hirotte tsurete itte mite moratte nekashita}}, an extreme case of verb chaining that I actually heard from a native speaker, meaning essentially “I went back home and picked it up, took him with me, had him looked at, then put him to bed,” in reference to retrieving a pharmacy form and taking a young son to the doctor and then putting him down for his afternoon nap.  Consequently, I don't think {{lang|ja|出て来る}} merits an entry.  :)  ‑‑&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 05:28, 6 December 2016 (UTC)

== Status of “definition popups”? ==

Can we get Navigation Popups to show the definitions of a word, as at [[:it:abbaside]], where I, with Navigation Popups enabled, get definitions when hovering over the links [[:it:Abbasidi|Abbasidi]], [[:it:pittura|pittura]] (multiple definitions and even a picture) and [[:it:sillibazione|sillibazione]] <small>(while, incidentally,  [[:it:aggetivo|aggetivo]] and [[:it:relativo|relativo]] merely show “''m sing''”)</small>? I for one would find this very helpful indeed, and I imagine I am far from alone.

There was a Grease pit [[Wiktionary:Grease_pit/2012/April#%22popup%22_definitions|discussion]] in April 2012 about this; it seems that back then it could be done with pretty heavy hacking. Our [[MediaWiki:Gadget-popups.js/documentation|documentation]] of our version of Navigation Popups says nothing about this (or about anything, really). This would ideally just happen when Navigation Popups were enabled, and also in page previews, if they exist apart from  Navigation Popups.

== Memory Mystification at [[βάρβαρος]] ==

There's nothing really remarkable about this entry: no translation table, only two language sections, and a descendants list with 14 languages. Previewing the Ancient Greek section shows 22.99 MB of memory used, while the Greek shows 8.67 MB. Commenting out both sections to leave only {{tl|also|βαρβάρα|barbaros|bárbaros|Barbaros}} shows 870 KB.

And yet, after I added the entry to the {{tl|redlink category}} exclusion list to clear an out of memory error, previewing the whole entry shows 47.27 MB. Commenting out {{tl|also|βαρβάρα|barbaros|bárbaros|Barbaros}} at the top causes that to jump to 49.08 MB!

As I always do, I checked for changes in any of the transcluded modules, and these are the only ones with revisions in the past few days: [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module:languages/datax&action=history], [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module:languages/data2&action=history], and [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module:scripts/data&action=history]- all very boring, routine edits that don't seem to be related. The only wildcard I can see is [[User:Isomorphyc]]'s inscrutable sharded data modules, but those are in most Ancient Greek entries, and I've never seen an out of memory error in an Ancient Greek entry before.

Something very strange is going on here. There's absolutely nothing to explain the 14+ MB difference between the memory usage of all the parts as previewed and that of the entry as a whole. I'm worried that this kind of thing may cause more 32MB entries to suddenly run out of memory- and we've got lots of those.

Are all those transliteration removals justified? I think that at least some of them are not, since a standardized way to transliterate do exist (for Indian scripts in particular). [[Special:Contributions/176.147.224.55|176.147.224.55]] 14:16, 19 March 2020 (UTC)

:::{{ec}} ''Are all those transliteration removals justified''? It depends. I support removal of Burmese translations. The current standard is MLCTS but there could be whatever. There are very few cases where the manual is justified, if the spelling is abnormal, as with {{m|my|ယောက်ျား}}. Perhaps such cases where manual transliteration is required (even if an automated exists) for certain languages should be marked in comments. For Indic languages, like any Dravidian no manual is required.
::: Hindi and other north Indian - should be case by case, the majority should be automated.
::: Thai and Khmer - ''if terms are defined and use the pronunciation templates'' - the automatic transliteration is more accurate. Otherwise, the manual may be justified, e.g. Khmer {{m|km|ឆែកកូស្លូវ៉ាគី||Czechoslovakia}} currently showing "chaekkou'''h'''l'''uu'''vaakii" (auotomated) but should be "chaekkouslouvaakii". --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 04:28, 20 March 2020 (UTC)

== Bot Request- frk  ==

15 hours ago, [[User:Mahagaja]] switched the language code frk (Frankish) from a full language to an etymology-only language. He spent 7 hours fixing the resulting module errors, and I've spent about 9 hours. After all of that, there are about 200 entries in [[:CAT:E]]- and there are lots more that haven't shown up yet.

I would like to request for someone with a bot to fix a subset of these that are straightforward and don't need human input.

* To start with, change all instances of:
:<code><nowiki>{{etyl|frk|en}} {{m|frk|</nowiki></code>
to:
:<code><nowiki>{{der|en|frk|</nowiki></code>

You'll also need to add an * to the term linked to if it doesn't already have one

The same goes for the codes ca, enm, es, frm, frp, gl, it, nrf, oc, pt and wa, though the most important ones are en, fr, enm and frm.

These are all languages that cannot have either borrowed or inherited from Frankish. 

* The other part is changing frk to gmw-pro in all instances of {{tl|m}} and {{tl|l}} that aren't preceded by an etymology template with which they could be merged (and adding * as needed).

Since this is just for cutting the task down to size, you don't have to worry about edge cases- when in doubt, skip it.

::::: (edit conflict) I wonder if we should rethink the restriction that disallows etymology-only languages like 'frk' in {{temp|m}} and {{temp|l}}. Consider this, for example (from {{m|fro|estoffer}}):

We could "fix" this by issuing an error that says something like "'frk' is an etymology-only language and disallowed, please use 'gmw-pro' instead", but why bother when we can just as easily accept the etymology-only language? It also seems to me there's useful info in specifying an etymology-only language in {{temp|l}} or {{temp|m}}, it says the term is particular to that lect.

This adds another step to the processing of these templates, including the generation of [[User:Jberkel/lists/wanted]] (pinging [[User:Jberkel]]), but that's easy to do if you already have code that handles etymology templates like {{temp|der}}. In theory it will ease splitting etymology languages into full languages, in the rare cases when that happens: templates would not have to be updated because they would already use the etymology language code, if people use the feature. At the moment using an etymology language code has no effect on the template output, except in {{temp|m+}}. — [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]·[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 23:03, 7 April 2020 (UTC)

== {{temp|t-simple}} is so useless ==

{{temp|t-simple}} is not working as documented. terms with diacritics are linking to wrong entries. The 2nd parameter is actually gender not "The word to link to." What's the point of having all these complex modules and templates if a translation is replaced with this and it's wrong: {{t-simple|be|любо́ў|f|langname=Belarusian|tr=ljubóŭ}} or  {{t-simple|ar|حُبّ|m|langname=Arabic|tr=ḥubb|interwiki=1}}. Of course [[любо́ў]] and [[حُبّ]] don't exist but [[любоў]] and [[حب]] do. Take a look at [[love#Translations]].

The regular templates: {{t|be|любо́ў|f}} and {{t+|ar|حُبّ|m}} work as expected. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 07:49, 23 March 2020 (UTC)
:It is working as documented, but the point of {{tl|t-simple}} is to reduce server load in various ways, including by not having diacritic stripping, automatic language name generation, or automatic transliteration. You type:
 &#123;{t-simple|be|любоў|alt=любо́ў|f|langname=Belarusian|tr=ljubóŭ}&#125;
And here:
*{{para|1}} is the language code, <code>be</code>
*{{para|2}} is the word you want to link to, in its page name form. This should be <code>любоў</code> without the diacritic.
*{{para|alt}} is the form you want to display, with diacritics
*{{para|3}} or {{para|g}} is the gender
*{{para|langname}} is the language name
*{{para|tr}} is the transliteration
:So it works, but it's a lot less user-friendly than {{tl|t}}. That's the price we pay for reducing server load and thus out-of-memory errors. —[[User:Mahagaja|Mahāgaja]] · [[User talk:Mahagaja|''talk'']] 08:39, 23 March 2020 (UTC)

Why is the Chinese version subtly different? The icon is smaller and multiple languages are listed in a single box, while the other has a separate box for each. Also, in all cases except the English, the link shows up on hover as <nowiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{lang}:{term}</nowiki>. This redirects to <nowiki>https://{lang}.wikipedia.org/wiki/{term}</nowiki>, but why doesn't the link point there to begin with?

====Usage notes====
* In the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa, ''black'' typically refers to people of African descent, including indirect African descent via the Caribbean, and including those with light skin. In Australia, Aboriginal Australians are often referred to as or identify as ''black''. In New Zealand, Maori people are sometimes referred to as or identify as ''black''.<ref>Mark Williams, "Ethnicity and Authenticity", in ''Comparative Literary Dimensions: Essays in Honor of Melvin J. Friedman'', edited by Melvin J. Friedman, Jay L. Halio, Ben Siegel, University of Delaware Press (2000, {{ISBN|9780874137156}}), page 194: "'Black' means very different things in different places. In America the word black usually means descended from Africa; East Indians are not generally defined as black there. In Britain, however, Asians often designate themselves as black. In New Zealand, Maori radicals sometimes use the world because it points to their difference from the dominant white culture in terms conveniently binary. Even vaguer uses of the word can be seen, such as the expression &quot;Black Irish,&quot; which refers to Irish people supposedly descended from Spanish sailors, or &quot; Black Maoris,&quot; who are believed by other Maoris to be descended from black sailors who jumped ship in the northern parts of New Zealand in the early contact period."</ref><ref>Carolyn Whitzman, ''The Handbook of Community Safety Gender and Violence Prevention: Practical Planning Tools'', Routledge (2012, {{ISBN|9781136553714}}), page 46:"the term 'black' refers to many different groups, depending upon the country where it is used. In the US, black means African-Americans, usually descendants of slaves, although there are a growing number of recent black migrants from the Caribbean and Africa. In Canada, black means people of African origin as well, usually first- or second-generation migrants from the Caribbean, although there is a smaller, more established, community descended from refugees from slavery in th US. In the UK, black usually means people of South Asian descent, who may be new migrants or who may be second- or third-generation citizens. In Australia, black means the indigenous people or Aboriginal Australians, who are descendants of inhabitants who predated European settlement by over 40,000 years. In South Africa, black means the indigenous peoples as well {{...}}"</ref><ref>[//www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html US Census Bureau definitions of racial groups]; [//www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html PBS article on American use]</ref><ref>See [[Citations:black]].</ref>

====Usage notes====
* Use of the noun ''black'' to refer to a person is often considered offensive, especially in the singular, and several guides and dictionaries recommend against its usage.<ref>{{R:Merriam-Webster Online}} "Use of the noun Black in the singular to refer to a person is considered offensive. The plural form Blacks is still commonly used by Black people and others to refer to Black people as a group or community, but the plural form too is increasingly considered offensive, and most style guides advise writers to use Black people rather than Blacks when practical."</ref><ref>{{R:Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}: "Using the noun black to refer to people with dark skin can be offensive, so it is better to use the adjective: ''black people • a black man/woman'' . It is especially offensive to use the noun with the definite article (‘the blacks’)"</ref><ref>{{R:Dictionary.com}} "As a noun, however, it does often offend. The use of the plural noun without an article is somewhat more accepted (home ownership among ''Blacks'' ); however, the plural noun with an article is more likely to offend (political issues affecting ''the Blacks'' ), and the singular noun is especially likely to offend (The small business proprietor is ''a Black'' ). Use the adjective instead: ''Black homeowners, Black voters, a Black business proprietor''." </ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210816190545/https://www.apstylebook.com/race-related-coverage AP Stylebook]: "Do not use [black] as a singular noun."</ref> It is more appropriate to use "a Black person" or "Black people" in the place of "a Black" or "the Blacks", respectively.
* See the usage notes in the adjective section regarding the capitalization and scope of the term.

====Pronunciation====

====Pronunciation====

==Dutch==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|nl|/mɛn/|/mə(n)/}}
* {{audio|nl|Nl-men.ogg}}
* {{hyphenation|nl|men}}
* {{rhymes|nl|ɛn|ən|s1=1}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|nl|dum|men}}, an unstressed variety of {{m|nl|man|t=man}}. Accordingly, originally pronounced with {{IPAchar|[ə]}}; now predominantly with a full vowel {{IPAchar|[ɛ]}}, especially in those areas where the word is chiefly literary. Compare {{cog|de|man}}, {{cog|enm|men|pos=indefinite pronoun}}.

====Pronoun====
{{head|nl|pronoun|cat2=indefinite pronouns}}

# {{lb|nl|indefinite|subject}} [[one]], [[you]], [[they]], [[everyone]]; [[humanity]], (the) [[people]], the [[public opinion]]
#: {{uxi|nl|'''Men''' zegt dat...|'''People''' say that.... It is said that...}}
#: {{uxi|nl|'''Men''' weet nooit wat er gaat gebeuren.|'''You''' never know what’s going to happen.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* When not used as a subject, {{m|nl||men}} must be replaced with {{m|nl|je|t=you}} or sometimes {{m|nl|ze|t=them}}.
* The word as such is very common in {{w|Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg}} and some other areas, where it is part of the local dialects. Elsewhere it is not downright rare but perceived as formal and predominantly replaced with {{m|nl||je}} and {{m|nl||ze}} even as a subject (similarly to {{m+|en|one}}).

====Usage notes====
The word ''god'' is often applied both to males and to females. The word was originally neuter in Proto-Germanic; monotheistic – notably Judeo-Christian – usage completely shifted the gender to masculine, necessitating the development of a feminine form, {{m|en|goddess}}. (In Old English the feminine {{m|ang|gyden}}, as well as a more explicitly marked masculine {{m|ang|goda}}, existed.)

#* '''1836''', Mihály Vörösmarty, ''Szózat''<sup>[https://mek.oszk.hu/01100/01122/html/vers0302.htm#23]</sup> ''(Appeal)''<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023449/http://www.laszlokorossy.net/magyar/szozat.html]</sup>
#*: A nagy világon '''e''' kivűl / Nincsen számodra hely;
#*:: In the great world outside of '''here''' / There is no place for you
#*::: ({{m|hu||“E kívül”}} would be {{m|hu||ezen kívül}} in present-day Hungarian, formed from {{m|hu|ez}}.)
<!-- Watson Kirkconnell's version has "No other spot in all the world / can touch your heart as home ―", which is less suitable here -->

=====Usage notes=====
A rarer substitute of {{m|hu|ez}}, but unlike {{m|hu||ez}}, it does not take the case of the noun it is attached to, and no definite article is used:
: {{ux|inline=1|hu|ez'''en a''' hely'''en''' ― e hely'''en'''|'''at''' this place|lit='''on''' this place}}
: {{ux|inline=1|hu|eb'''ben a''' ház'''ban''' ― e ház'''ban'''|'''in''' this house}}

Most consonant-initial postpositions can take {{m|hu||e}}, e.g. {{m|hu||e nélkül, e helyett}}, see ''[[Template:hu-comp-postp|Pronominal adverbs from postpositions]],'' in the column “that&nbsp;one, this&nbsp;one”. On the other hand, vowel-initial postpositions take {{m|hu||ez}} (e.g. {{m|hu||ez alatt, ez iránt}}).

They are simply long A, long E, etc. (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). Nor is there any uncertainty with respect to the six mutes B, C, D, G, P, T. Their names are bē, cē, dē, gē, pē, tē (each with a long E).

==Latvian==
{{wikipedia|lang=lv}}

===Etymology===
Proposed in 1908 as part of the new Latvian spelling by the scientific commission headed by [[w:Kārlis Mīlenbahs|K. Mīlenbahs]], which was accepted and began to be taught in schools in 1909. Prior to that, Latvian had been written in German [[Fraktur]], and sporadically in [[Cyrillic]].

====Letter====
[[File:Latin alphabet Ee.svg|thumb|200px|E]]
{{lv-letter|upper=E|lower=e}}

# {{Latn-def|lv|letter|7|e}}

=====Usage notes=====
The letter '''''E'''''/'''''e''''' (like its long counterpart '''''Ē'''''/'''''ē''''') represent two sounds, {{IPAchar|[ɛ]}} — {{m|lv|šaurais e||narrow e}} — and {{IPAchar|[æ]}} — {{m|lv|platais e||broad e}}. In principle, {{IPAchar|[ɛ]}} is used when there is a palatal element (the vowels ''i'', ''ī'', ''e'', ''ē'', the diphthongs ''ie'', ''ei'', and the palatal consonants ''j'', ''ķ'', ''ģ'', ''ļ'', ''ņ'', ''š'', ''ž'', ''č'', ''dž'', and, in the old spelling, ''ŗ'') either in the same or in the following syllable; otherwise, {{IPAchar|[æ]}} is used. Unfortunately, some historical changes have obscured this pattern by removing some previously existing palatal elements; as a result of that, for a number of words the actual pronunciation of the letter ''e'' — {{IPAchar|[ɛ]}} or {{IPAchar|[æ]}} — must be memorized.

This particle accompanies several tonal changes, as well as a simplification or elision of the coda of the possessed noun in some cases. Many nouns can be linked directly in possessive constructions without using this particle, chiefly those that denotes humans or animals when used in the singular, although it is impossible to predict exactly which nouns will follow which pattern based on semantics, ancestral noun class, or morphology.

===Notes===
* In Canada, ''à'' and ''a'' are not homophones, ''à'' [a], ''a'' [ɑː].

===Etymology 1===

====Letter====
{{head|fr|letter|lower case||upper case|À}}

# {{n-g|A with [[grave accent]], a [[letter]] used in French mostly to distinguish some [[homograph]]s and in [[transliteration]].}}

=====Usage notes=====
* Use of accents on capital letters is variable. European usage is sometimes to omit accents, though the French Academy considers it incorrect.<ref>{{cite-web|url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/questions-de-langue#5_strong-em-accentuation-des-majuscules-em-strong|title=Questions de langue|work=French Academy|year=1990}}</ref> This is partly due to the keyboard layout used in France. Quebec usage is to put accents on capitals.

===Etymology 2===
{{dercat|fr|itc-pro|ine-pro|inh=1}}
{{inh+|fr|fro|a}}, a merge of {{inh|fr|la|ad}} and {{m|la|ab}}.

=====Usage notes=====
<ul>
  <li>
    Expresses a report/ratio of place ([[to]]), time ([[at]]), means, manner, price. It can indicate possession ([[of]] or [['s]]), particularly when used with a disjunctive personal pronoun, e.g. {{m|fr|à [[moi]]}}, {{m|fr|à [[eux]]}}, {{m|fr|à [[elle]]}}.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduces several types of grammatical complement: indirect object, attribution, name, adjective.
    <ul>
      <li>
        In French, a good number of [[intransitive]] verbs use {{m|fr||'''à'''}} to mark an [[indirect object]], e.g. {{m|fr|réussir|reussir '''à'''|t=to succeed at}}. Sometimes, their English equivalents are transitive verbs taking direct objects, e.g. {{m|fr|jouer|jouer '''à''' (un jeu)|t=to play (a game)}}, in which case, translations generally do not require any counterpartial element be rendered for '''à''', though some ways of rendering certain verbs will allow for it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When {{m|fr||à}} is followed by a definite article, the two combine to give the following combined forms: 
    {| class="wikitable"
    ! à + article
    ! Combined form
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|le}}
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|au}}
    |-
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|à la|à + la}}
    | align="center" | {{small|''unchanged'' <br>({{l|fr|à la}})}}
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|l'}}
    | align="center" | {{small|''unchanged'' <br>(à l')}}
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|les}}
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|aux}}
    |}
    <ul>
      <li>
        However, {{m|fr|à la}} and {{m|fr||à l'}} are almost entirely not used if the location referred to is a country, subnational division, or continent, in which case, {{m|fr|en}} is used instead. (The same does not hold, however, for {{m|fr|au}} and {{m|fr|aux}}.) Compare {{m|fr|France|en France}} and {{m|fr|États-Unis|aux États-Unis}}. The most notable exception is {{m|fr|Barbade|à la Barbade}}.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Logically following the previously described rule, '''à''' combines with the relative pronouns, which themselves contain an element of the definite article, producing these forms:
    {| class="wikitable"
    ! à + article
    ! Combined form
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|lequel}}
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|auquel}}
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|laquelle}}
    | align="center" | {{m|fr||à laquelle}}
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|lesquels}}
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|auxquels}}
    |-
    | align="center" | à + {{l|fr|lesquelles}}
    | align="center" | {{l|fr|auxquelles}}
    |}
  </li>
</ul>

====Usage notes====
* In contrast to {{m|vi|không}} which is used to make a yes-no question, ''à'' is used to seek confirmation, roughly equivalent to {{cog|ja|ね|tr=ne}} or the English use of tag questions. Compare to {{m|vi|nhỉ}}, which is similar to {{cog|ja|よ|tr=yo}} in that it is used to make a light assertion or remark. However, ''à'' denotes a speaker's stronger belief that the hearer will agree with him or her than the expression {{m|vi|phải không}}.
* The negative reply to this type of question can start with ''không phải'' only to questions with a nominal predicate. Otherwise, the negative reply starts with {{m|vi|không}} (or its variants, such as {{m|vi|hông}}) or some other negators such as {{m|vi|đâu}}.

====Usage notes====
* In North America, {{m|en|native}}/{{m|en|Native}} came into use as an umbrella term for the indigenous inhabitants of America as {{m|en|Indian}} began to fall out of formal usage (because it originated from Columbus's mistaken belief that he was in India and the people he encountered were Indians). Other designations include {{m|en|Native American}}, {{m|en|Native Canadian}}, and {{m|en|American Indian}}. In Canada, the terms include {{m|en|Inuit}} and {{m|en|Metis}} and the adjectives {{m|en|First Nation}}/{{m|en|First Nations}}.

====Synonyms====

====Usage notes====
{{rel-top|Use of silent H}}
* In the German-based spelling, silent ''h'' may be written to indicate a preceding long vowel. Some writers make liberal use of this, but the predominant tendency is to use doubled vowel letters instead and allow ''h'' only in the following cases:
** where it serves to indicate a hiatus: {{m|gmw-cfr|bloo|blohe}} {{IPAchar|[ˈblɔːə]}};
** where the German cognate has ''h'' as well: {{m|gmw-cfr|fähle}} (German {{m|de|fehlen}});
** where the German cognate has ''ch'' or ''g'': {{m|gmw-cfr|maache|mäht}} (German {{m|de|macht}}).
* Silent ''h'' is not used in the Dutch-based spelling.

==German==

===Etymology 1===

====Pronunciation====
* {{q|phoneme}} {{IPA|de|/h/}}
** The letter is silent in the syllable coda, before {{IPAchar|/ə/}}, and before suffixes. In common speech, ''h'' is frequently silent in the onset of all word-internal unstressed syllables, thus e.g. in {{m|de|-heit}} and {{m|de|-haft}} (unless these have secondary stress).
* {{q|name}} {{IPA|de|/haː/}}
** {{audio|de|De-h.ogg}}
** {{rhymes|de|aː|s=1}}

====Letter====
{{head|de|letters|upper case||lower case|h}}

# The eighth letter of the German alphabet.

=====Usage notes=====
{{rel-top|Spelling rules for silent ''h''}}
For the use of silent ''h'' in German orthography one may note three general rules:
# It occurs only after long monophthongs and the diphthong ''ei''.
# It occurs after simple ''i'' only in the pronominal stems {{m|de|ihm}}, {{m|de|ihn|ihn-}}, {{m|de|ihr|ihr-}}, and in {{m|de|Schlemihl}}.
# It is mostly restricted to native Germanic words; instances in loanwords are exceptional.

Expanding on this, one can distinguish three types of silent ''h'':
# Etymological ''h'' is written in words where {{noncog|gmh|-}} had a consonant that has become silent; this was usually ''h'', occasionally ''g'' or ''w''. Etymological ''h'' is missing only in a few words (e.g. {{m|de|rau}}, {{m|de|Ton}}, {{m|de|Träne}}).
# Hiatus-breaking ''h'' is written when an inflectable word stem ends in a long monophthong. This, too, is missing only in a few native words (e.g. {{m|de|säen}}, certain nouns like {{m|de|Knie}}, {{m|de|See}}, {{m|de|Schnee}}).
# Lengthening ''h'' (in the strict sense) may be written between long ''a, ä, e, o, ö, u, ü'' and following ''l, m, n, r''. Its use is very irregular and it is missing in a great deal of words. At times this is done to distinguish homophones (e.g. {{m|de|malen}} vs. {{m|de|mahlen}}), but in general there is no clear system. One can note that lengthening ''h'' proper does not occur in stems starting with ''sch-, sp-, t-''. It is overall rare in words starting with more than one consonant, but there are several counterexamples (e.g. {{m|de|Drohne}}, {{m|de|prahlen}}, {{m|de|Stuhl}}).

{{wikipedia|lang=lv}}

===Etymology===
Proposed in 1908 as part of the new Latvian spelling by the scientific commission headed by [[w:Kārlis Mīlenbahs|K. Mīlenbahs]], which was accepted and began to be taught in schools in 1909. Prior to that, Latvian had been written in German [[Fraktur]], and sporadically in [[Cyrillic]].

# {{Latn-def|lv|letter|12|hā}}

====Usage notes====
The letter '''''H'''''/'''''h''''' (like '''''F'''''/'''''f''''', and '''''O'''''/'''''o''''' representing [o], [oː] instead of [uə̯]) is found only in words of foreign origin (borrowings). Note that it represents the sound of IPA [x] (like {{cog|de|machen}}, {{m|de|ach}}), not (as in most other alphabets based on the Latin script) the sound of IPA [h].

===Etymology===
From Gaj's Latin alphabet {{m|sh|H}}, from {{der|sl|cs|-}} alphabet {{m|cs|H}}, from Latin {{der|sl|la|H}}, from {{der|sl|ett|𐌇|pos=he}}, from {{der|sl|grc|Η|pos=eta}}, from {{m|phn|𐤇|pos=het}}, from the {{der|sl|egy|-}} hieroglyph {{m|egy|𓈈}} or maybe {{m|egy|𓉗}}. Pronunciation as {{IPAfont|/xə/}} is initial Slovene (phoneme plus a fill vowel) and the second pronunciation is probably taken from {{der|sl|de|H}}.

In Metelko alphabet, the phoneme was written by two different letters whether it was pronounced as velar {{IPAchar|/x/}} or glottal {{IPAchar|/h/}}, a distinction irrelevant to nowadays standard and the distinction was also not used by all writers.

===Etymology===
Similar interjections can be found in other Finnic languages (compare {{cog|et|no}}, {{m|et|noh}}, {{cog|izh|no}}, {{cog|krl|no}}, {{cog|liv|no}}, {{m|liv|noh}}, {{cog|lud|no}}, {{cog|vot|no}}) and possibly also in other Uralic languages (compare {{cog|kpv|но}}, {{cog|udm|но}}). Compare also to those found in neighboring Indo-European languages (such as {{cog|sv|nå}}, {{cog|lv|nu}}, {{cog|ru|ну}}), which may all trace back as far as {{cog|ine-pro|*nu}}. SSA concludes that the interjection is probably part original and part foreign.<ref>{{R:fi:SSA}}</ref>

{{uses lua|Module:audio}}
This template links to an audio file of spoken language, typically in the "Pronunciation" section of an entry to indicate how a term is pronounced.

To link to an audio file connected to the ''meaning'' of the entry (for example, a recording of a klaxon sound in the {{m|en|klaxon}} entry), use {{tl|listen}}.

==Parameters==
; {{para|1|req=1}}
: The language code (see [[Wiktionary:List of languages]]) for the current language section. <small>The parameter {{para|lang}} is a deprecated synonym; please do not use. If this is used, all numbered parameters move down by one.</small>
; {{para|2|req=1}}
: The name of the audio file.
; {{para|3}}
: The caption to use, in place of "Audio". In most cases, don't override this, but use one of the following parameters instead.
; {{para|q}}
: Specifies a qualifier to be placed before the audio box, after the "Audio" caption. This is formatted with the {{tl|q}}/{{tl|qualifier}} template.
; {{para|a}}
: Specifies one or more comma-separated accent qualifiers to be placed before the audio box, after the "Audio" caption, and are useful for specifying the accent found in the audio file. These are formatted with the {{tl|a}}/{{tl|accent}} template. To be recognized as a separator, there must be no space following the comma; otherwise, the comma is treated as an embedded comma within the accent qualifier.
; {{para|qq}}
: Specifies a qualifier to be placed at the end, after the audio box. Normally, use {{para|q}} instead of this, unless the qualifier is particularly long. This is formatted with the {{tl|q}}/{{tl|qualifier}} template.
; {{para|aa}}
: Specifies one or more comma-separated accent qualifiers to be placed at the end, after the audio box. Normally, use {{para|a}} instead of this, unless the qualifier is particularly long. These are formatted with the {{tl|a}}/{{tl|accent}} template. To be recognized as a separator, there must be no space following the comma; otherwise, the comma is treated as an embedded comma within the accent qualifier.
; {{para|ref}}
: Specifies one or more reference notes to be placed directly after the audio box. The reference is placed in the <code>===References===</code> section at the bottom of the language's entry. See below for the format of this parameter.
; {{para|text}}
: Specifies the text of the audio snippet, if it isn't the same as the term being illustrated. This can be used, for example, when the audio snippet contains extra words in it (e.g. articles).
; {{para|IPA}}
: Specifies the IPA pronunciation of the audio snippet. This can be used, for example, when the audio snippet contains extra words in it, to make it easier to pick out the relevant term. The IPA should be enclosed in brackets or slashes, like the parameters of {{tl|IPA}}.
; {{para|t}}
: Specifies the meaning (gloss) of the text in {{para|text}}, if that text is in a foreign language and its meaning isn't obvious.
; {{para|lit}}
: Specifies the literal meaning of the text in {{para|text}}, if needed.
; {{para|tr}}
: Specifies the manual transliteration of the text in {{para|text}}, for text in non-Latin scripts where either the automatic transliteration isn't correct or there is no automatic transliteration (e.g. in Persian and Hebrew).
; {{para|ts}}
: Specifies the transcription of the text in {{para|text}}, for text in non-Latin scripts where the transliteration is radically different from the actual pronunciation. To be used sparingly and only for certain languages; see the description of this parameter in {{tl|l}} for more information.
; {{para|pos}}
: Specifies the part of speech of the text in {{para|text}}. Included mostly for completeness; rarely needed.
; {{para|nocat|1}}
: Turns off categorization.
; {{para|sort}}
: Manual sortkey. Use sparingly; the {{code|lua|makeSortKey}} method in [[Module:languages]] can usually generate the correct sortkey.
; {{para|bad}}
: To formulate a warning to the reader about quality problems of the audio.

==References==
The {{para|ref<var>N</var>}} parameter is used to specify one or more references for a given pronunciation and works similarly to the <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tag. For example, specifying {{para|ref|<nowiki>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</nowiki>}} is similar to placing <code><nowiki><ref>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref></nowiki></code> after the call to {{temp|IPA}}, except that it can be used to insert references directly after a given pronunciation when there are several.

To specify multiple references, separate them with <code> !!! </code> (optionally with spaces around it). For example, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}} !!! {{R:it:Olivetti}}}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref>{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref><ref>{{R:it:Olivetti}}</ref></nowiki></code>

To specify the equivalent of the <code><nowiki><ref name="NAME" group="GROUP">...</ref></nowiki></code>, use <code><<name:NAME>></code> and/or <code><<group:GROUP>></code> directly following the reference text. For example, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}<<name:bendo>> !!! {{R:it:Olivetti}}}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref name="bendo">{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref><ref>{{R:it:Olivetti}}</ref></nowiki></code>

Similarly, the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref={{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}<<name:bendo>><<group:pron>>}}</nowiki></code>

is similar to the following:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg}}<ref name="bendo" group="pron">{{R:it:DiPI|bendo}}</ref></nowiki></code>

To reference a prior name, as in <code><nowiki><ref name="bendo"/></nowiki></code>, leave the reference text blank:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref=<<name:bendo>>}}</nowiki></code>

Similarly, to reference a prior name in a particular group, as in <code><nowiki><ref name="bendo" group="pron"/></nowiki></code>, use:

<code><nowiki>{{audio|it|It-bendo.ogg|ref=<<name:bendo>><<group:pron>>}}</nowiki></code>

In the late twenties or early thirties of the 20th century, it appeared as a simplification of {{m|zh|ㄮ}}, writing the dot and the second stoke of the bottom part {{m|zh|ㄛ}} with one stroke. {{m|zh|ㄮ}} was itself derived from {{m|zh|ㄛ}} in 1920, when a new allophone appeared, writing a dot to differentiate between them.

== [[one x two xs]] ==

I have a question, I have seen entries like this one before for templates for phrases as entries so I gave it a try with one I saw was missing, have I done it right?[[User:Luciferwildcat|Lucifer]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 22:43, 13 April 2012 (UTC)

: No, these have failed RFV/RFD in the past, since they are not used in language this way (with the letter X). Examples were [[X one's Y off]] and [[I'll see you X and raise you Y]]. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 17:25, 14 April 2012 (UTC)
== [[Singlish]] ==

[[w:Singlish]] has an entry saying it's a creole language with no ISO 639 code. Is it really a language, and if it is, what code do we use for it? If it's English-based, it might be {{temp|gmw-sin}} ({{temp|etyl:gmw}} is for West Germanic, and English is West Germanic). [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 15:48, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

: Maybe we could enter it as English with a Singapore gloss. It seems to read more like English than anything else. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 15:51, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:: It's not a creole. WP editors (and linguistically uninformed people generally) have an unfortunate tendency to call any language that shows any sort of influence from an unrelated language a "creole" or a "mixed language" without understanding what those terms actually mean. It's not a separate language either. If we have any "Singlish" forms here, just list them under English and tag them {{temp|Singapore}}. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 22:30, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::That's right, Singlish is an example of code-switching and mixing languages, uneducated English in general. It's similar to [[Chinglish]], [[Engrish]]/[[Japlish]], [[Runglish]], etc. The spread and importance of Singlish is also exaggerated. Yes, Chinese people say "okey lah" (see {{l|cmn|啦|sc=Hani}}) and make grammatical errors but it's not exclusive to Singapore, it's just the influence of people's mother tongue on whatever language they speak. I also don't think it's something that stays unchanged for a significant period. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]])</sup> 23:20, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
== out of context in an attributive sense ==

[[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Fictional_universes]]:

<blockquote>With respect to names of persons or places from fictional universes, they shall not be included unless they are used out of context in an attributive sense, for example:

*'''2004''', Robert Whiting, ''The Meaning of Ichiro: The New Wave from Japan and the Transformation of Our National Pastime'', p. 130:
*:Irabu had hired Nomura, a man with whom he obviously had a great deal in common, and, who, as we have seen, was rapidly becoming the '''Darth Vader''' of Japanese baseball.
*'''1998''', Harriet Goldhor Lerner, ''The Mother Dance: How Children Change Your Life'', p. 159:
*:Steve and I explained the new program to our children, who looked at us as if we had just announced that we were from the planet '''Vulcan'''.
</blockquote>

[[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion#Fictional_universes]] and [[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Fictional_universes]] require fictional names to be cited “out of context in an [[attributive]] sense.” But the terms are not used attributively in the examples. How are we to interpret this guideline? Are the examples incorrect?&nbsp;''—[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2012-04-01&nbsp;17:23&nbsp;z</small>''

:I have myself been under the impression that others had superior knowledge of the meaning of {{term|attributive}} so that the uses above would be included. But I can find no evidence that there is such a generally accepted meaning in any applicable linguistic sense. Quite to the contrary, the contrasting term {{term|predicative}} seems directly applicable to the 2004 example. Accordingly, one or contributors must have been mistaken. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  18:42, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Right, the linguistic interpretation of ''attributive'' does not apply. So it must be the other meaning, "pertaining to or having the character of attribution or an attribute". [[User talk:DAVilla|DAVilla]] 04:19, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I'm skeptical. In the Vulcan quote, there is no “attributive sense” to the term. The children's disbelief is conveyed by a metaphor stemming from the sentence's syntax. And such a generalized sense of “attributive” isn't even given in most dictionaries, so this should be rewritten unambiguously, no matter which way interpret it. Finally, [[Vulcan]] is a not a supporting example, because the “Star Trek planet” sense is absent from Wiktionary.&nbsp;''—[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2012-04-03&nbsp;16:10&nbsp;z</small>''

:::: If CFI is somewhat ambiguous, maybe we do need to have it clarified. Isn't it somewhat disturbing your statement that the example in CFI does not meet CFI? I maintain that the common meaning of ''attributive'' is applicable, and I challenge you to find any dictionary that does not have this meaning. Plus, you should have your eyes checked. We've had the Star Trek planet sense since the very day the page was created. [[User talk:DAVilla|DAVilla]] 18:11, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

::I think with this policy, something like "Joker laugh", you probably won't understand what this means unless you know who Joker from the Batman franchise is. I'm ok with it so far. But if I hear a song on the radio and someone says "this has a 90s sound to it", we can't really add to [[90s]] a definition to cover what music was like in the 90s. At some point, popular culture information has to go on Wikipedia. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 15:53, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Yes. The policy should help unwind the difficult exercise of excluding specific references, but including terms with inherent meaning (which may, confusingly, originate in specific references).

:: The two votes on brand names were quickly started, and have created not much of overhead and endless discussion. Those who wanted to discuss could do so on the talk pages of the votes, and they did, indeed. I think I and Liliana should be applauded for creating these two votes. We are getting things done. I now even think that Liliana was right to let the other vote start mere week after the start of the first vote. It's a pity that there are so many vote-haters in Wiktionary. Furthermore, the extension of the regulation of brand names to non-physical products has been discussed countless times in WT:RFV, so a lot of discussion actually already took place long before the votes were created. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 15:58, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::To be clear, I don't hate votes, but I guess my philosophy on their purpose differs from others.  I've always thought that votes were meant to be a documentation of previously established consensus.  Essentially, that votes shouldn't be started until it's patently obvious which way they'll go.  They shouldn't require further discussion because the discussion has been more or less fully resolved.  I'll take your word for it that there was a fair amount of discussion on the topics beforehand.  However, there were clearly subtopics which weren't discussed, or weren't discussed properly beforehand, as evidenced by the talk pages of those votes.  In any case, I'm not disparaging the vote creators, whom I will concede are getting things done.  Rather, I'm disparaging the current methodology of getting things done, which I view as extremely inefficient.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 23:11, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== First-person Singular Imperative of Portuguese Verbs ==

An anon complained at [[Talk:cantar]] that there’s no 1st person singular imperative in Portuguese, and as far as I’m aware he is correct. If you look at [[fazer]], our conjugation includes the 1st person singular imperative (affirmative and negative). Note the following links:
* ([http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperativo pt:wp]) “No imperativo, não existe a primeira pessoa do singular (eu)” (For the imperative, there is no first person singular (I)).
* ([http://pt.wiktionary.org/wiki/fazer pt:wt]) No 1st person singular imperative (open the dropdown under the header '''Conjugação'''. 1st person singular is the first column, imperatives are the 10th and 11th rows).
* ([http://www.dicio.com.br/fazer/ Online dictionary 1]) ditto (under the header '''Imperativo''', notice how it has 5 items, while the other moods have 6)
* ([http://www.conjuga-me.net/verbo-fazer Online dictionary 2]) ditto (1st person singular imperatives marked with a dash).

It is my opinion that the 1st person singular imperative should be removed from the Portuguese conjugation table ({{temp|pt-conj/theTable}}). Is anyone opposed to this?  <small>[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]]</small> 12:12, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

Back from the library. I found the book mentioned by Daniel, and it confirms my theory (at least in the edition I had access to).
#* '''1977''', Evanildo Bechara, ''Moderna Gramática Portuguesa'', 22nd edition, Companhia Editora Nacional, page 116:
#*: O imperativo em português só tem formas apenas para as segundas pessoas; as pessoas que faltam são supridas pelos correspondentes do presente subjuntivo. '''Não se usa o imperativo de 1.ª pessoa do singular'''. As terceiras pessoas do imperativo se referem a ''você'', ''vocês'' e não a ''eles''. Também não se usa o imperativo nas orações negativas; neste caso empregam-se as formas correspondentes do presente do subjuntivo.
#*:: The imperative in Portuguese only has forms for the second-persons; the missing persons are supplied by the correspondents of the present subjunctive. '''The 1st person singular of the imperative is not used'''. The third persons of the imperative refer to ''[[você]]'', ''[[vocês]]'' and not to ''[[eles]]''. The imperative is also not used in negative clauses; in this case the correspondent forms of the present subjunctive are employed.
Following this paragraph, there is a table with the conjugation of the affirmative and negative imperatives of the verb [[cantar]], and in both of them the first person singular is marked with a dash. I also skimmed quickly through some pages to find conjugation tables; in every one I found (pages 129, 133, 136, 144), 1st person singular imperative was missing.

Maybe this changed in subsequent editions, but if it didn’t I’d say this is evidence enough for the removal of the 1st person singular imperative from the Portuguese conjugation table.

Also, hats off to Ruakh, who was right about it being subjunctive. <small>[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]]</small> 23:41, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

: If you do want to remove it from conjugation tables (which sounds reasonable to me), then I think you should do that by modifying {{temp|pt-conj/doWork}} or {{temp|pt-conj/doWork/add}} rather than {{temp|pt-conj/theTable}}: the latter happily lets the first-person-singular-imperatives have some sort of indication of non-existence (such as an em dash or a blank space), as long as parameters #69 and #75 are set properly. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:29, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

== Requesting input for extinct and other sparsely documented languages ==

Thanks to the great feedback provided, the proposal for [[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-03/CFI_for_Endangered_Languages|endangered languages]] CFI needs to be reworded and is essentially stopped. (Do I need to somehow terminate it?) 

1. Although I have asked twice for clarification of the [[Wiktionary:CFI#Attestation|CFI for extinct languages]], however, I haven't gotten any feedback on that. It currently reads: "For terms in extinct languages: usage in at least one contemporaneous source."

One of the criticisms of my proposed vote was the word "usage" instead of "mention." But the CFI for extinct languages also uses the word "usage." Also, the word "contemporaneous" is used. I'm not sure why it's worded like that.

My current thought is to propose that all sparsely documented languages (including extinct and most endangered languages) have a criterion such as this: "Contextually appropriate usage or mention in at least one source." 

That will allow for quoting scholars who are not contemporaneous with the language when it was alive.

2. I think that the wording in 1 will provide room for abuse, however. With only one usage or mention, somebody can just upload to Usenet a hastily typed document with lots of errors and proclaim it to be a valid source, forcing inappropriate words onto Wiktionary. I therefore want to provide a mechanism to provide balance and curb abuse of that criterion. My line of thinking is something like this: "Each sparsely documented language will maintain a '''page''' that provides space for discussing whether sources are appropriate."

That '''page''' can be the About page or a completely separate page; additionally, people can bring it to the Wiktionary community at large and call a vote, though hopefully that will not be necessary.

Any comments and feedback are greatly appreciated. [[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BenjaminBarrett12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 23:38, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:Reading the comments, I suspect that the final product should probably treat the various groups (extinct, endangered, poorly documented) separately, as a number of the oppose/abstain votes took issue with lumping them together.  The notion of allowing each language to essentially define its own criteria on its 'About' page is a very robust approach, which, in an ideal world would probably be best.  However, I suspect that many editors will be uneasy with the inherent ambiguity of such an approach.  Personally, I'm not entirely certain how I feel about it.  Regarding use/mention, it should probably be noted that Ancient Greek is already allowing mentions.  {{m|grc|θεπτάνων}} is a mention only term.  It is never used in an ancient context, but is merely mentioned and defined by the ancient dictionary written by [[w:Hesychius]].  If we restricted ourselves to use, there may well be justification for that, but we should realize the consequences of doing so, namely that we will never have important, and almost certainly real, words in our dictionary that others will have.  Of course, a compromise approach would be 'use only' with notable exceptions when appropriate, which would solve the problem for {{m|grc|θεπτάνων}} at least.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 00:39, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Thank you for the feedback. The issue of doing extinct languages separately is one of the reasons I'm asking about the current policy: I just don't see why extinct languages should be restricted to contemporaneous usage only when the other groups would not be, or what makes extinct languages so unique. (Also, there is a lot of fuzzy overlap between endangered and extinct languages that makes it difficult to separate them.)

:::Can we also consider languages, which are NOT endangered but English language resources are limited, multiple transliteration methods exist and our contents in these languages are very scarce? For example, Sinhalese resources in English are almost non-existent, si wiki is nearly dead and very few here would be able to say about what transliteration methods would be right? Yes, having "just one source" for endangered languages sounds right and the source may not be on the web but from a book.

One thing might be to match the count of trans-tables to the count of senses (excluding &lit senses) for polysemic English PoSes. Another might be to list each trans-gloss that does not consist of (meaningful) words that are in a sense including any context-type labels. Polysemic PoSes can also have problems with synonyms. This is in principle doable with dump processing. Once we have cleaned up the backlog, it could be left to a bot to track changes. Perhaps the closers of RfDs and RfVs and other contributors could leave a special template if the sense content changes and they do not make corresponding changes in the glosses.

Don't just change definitions and trans glosses lightly. People who made valid translations may not come back. Also, frustrated when translations are converted into "to be checked" sections. I know it's hard but perhaps this could be avoided if definitions and translations are in synch and when the most common or intuitive definition of a term comes first (before any additional senses), the most common translation will also come into the first gloss. Endless splitting may also be counterproductive, like with [[pass#Verb]]. There are so many definitions but I struggle to find the sense, which applies to "pass the time" (or maybe it's missing?). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]])</sup> 02:27, 11 April 2012 (UTC)
::Having numbers in translation tables might not be so bad after all, especially for entries which have a large number of definitions. Take [[break]] as an example. We have currently 27 definitions and 31 translation tables. Why? Because, for definition #1 there are four translation tables and for definition 23 there are two. There is potential for another two tables as definition # 23 has three subdefinitions and somebody might want to create a table for the sense that is common for all subsenses. This is really time-consuming for omeone who would want to either find or edit translations. Also, when doing the actual editing, it is not easy to locate the correct one among 31 options in a set of 27. I admit that the numbers might sometimes refer to a wrong definition, but if there would be the number <u>and</u> the gloss, the numbering would at least make it easier to detect an eventual mess and fix it. Either way, the current model of separating definitions and translations in separate lists is apt to cause confusion. What if we had a slightly different format for translation tables and they would immediately follow a definition in the same way the quotations do? --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 07:11, 19 April 2012 (UTC)

:::As I was reading the first part of your comment, I was thinking the same thing you suggest in the end: what if we put translations next to senses? The obvious downside is that the edit window becomes less navigable, for someone trying to change e.g. the sixth of twelve senses. (Imagine [[[[water]]]] or [[[[iron]]]] sorted that way). But there are always trade-offs, and this would have the benefit of reducing the tendency of entries to accrue translations sections that are out of sync.

== Normalised spellings of ancient languages ==

There are some ancient languages, that are commonly written in normalised spelling. This means that the spelling is brought into a common form, which may not be the form that is actually attested in writing. One such language is Old Norse. A word such as {{m|non|kvelja}} might have actually been spelled <qvelia> in the original document, and {{m|non|ek}} is more usually written <ec>. Similar normalisations are also commonly applied to other Germanic languages. It seems to me that such normalised forms are definitely useful (even moreso than the spellings of the original document), but they technically don't meet CFI because they are not actually attested. I am wondering what kind of consensus or policy exists on this practice so far. Personally I think they should be allowed for any language with no consistent spelling system, provided the normalisation scheme is explained somewhere. And of course I'm not suggesting that the spellings of the manuscripts themselves can not be added, too (maybe as alternative forms pointing to the normalised spellings). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 19:32, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

: I would consider any publication of a work valid for attestation; I see no reason that you can't cite Oxford's Anthology of Old Norse, e.g., for a spelling. I would consider them far more useful then the manuscript spellings, as there's probably hundreds of copies of such anthologies for each copy in the original spelling.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 22:32, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

:::If it's relevant, miniscules (lowercase letters) and accents were all invented well after nearly all the important Ancient Greek works, yet all of our Ancient Greek words make use of them.  It's a scholarly standard.  The point is, Ancient Greek on Wiktionary has fairly specific orthography standards (with a few grey areas), and as it happens, every other Wiktionary seems to be following identicalish standards, as evidenced by the existence of interwikis.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 23:00, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: That does clear up some things but I do still have questions. When it comes to normalisation of ancient Germanic languages, there are different standards (if you can call them that). Those standards don't usually conflict, it's more a matter of how much normalisation they apply. For example, one source might normalise i to j where appropriate, another might normalise uu to w and u to v where appropriate, another might normalise c to k, yet another might also normalise qu to kw, some might also apply morphological standardisation, and different sources might apply different combinations of these normalisations. It would be hard for us to show all combinations, and it still leaves open the question of which scheme Wiktionary itself standardises on (for consistency and clarity if nothing else). {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:00, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

:<small>rambling thoughts on the matter:</small> When a portion of a work (not just one word) is printed in two (or one, or three, etc) editions using different normalised spellings, I consider both printings to contain CFI-satisfying uses of whatever spellings they contain, in the same way one printing of the Bible using [[[[vnto]]]] can be used to cite [[[[vnto]]]], and another using [[[[unto]]]] can be used to cite [[[[unto]]]] (even though they're not independent, etc etc), so I'd allow all attested normalisations. I'd also consider original manuscripts and facsimiles ''there''of to contain CFI-satisfying uses of words, so I believe we should always ''allow'' manuscript ''spellings'' to have entries (which can soft-redirect to the normalised spellings). I would still normalise upper- vs lower-case, i.e. have an entry at [[[[en]]]] even if manuscripts have [[[[En]]]] or [[[[eN]]]], because our search function and see-{{temp|also}}s handle case differences but not spelling differences, and because it is our longstanding, fundamental policy to have entries for different spellings ([[[[colour]]]], [[[[color]]]]) but not different capitalisations ([[[[COLOUR]]]], [[[[Color]]]]). As for which normalisation to standardise on: I suppose the editors of each language can decide that amongst themselves, just like the editors of various languages can decide on systems of romanisation.

:: I've elaborated on normalisation some on [[WT:AOSX]], [[WT:AODT]], [[WT:AGOH]] and [[WT:ANON]]. Is this ok? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 16:57, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
:::See also my note at [[Wiktionary talk:About Middle French]]. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 17:39, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I like what you've written at [[WT:AOSX]] and [[WT:AGOH]], though I have two questions about the specific normalisation schemes: I presume the note that 'u, uu'='w' applies only when 'u' is consonantal, so 'ubar' is not 'wber' <tt>;)</tt> &mdash; and why normalise 'u, uu' to 'w', but 'kw' to 'qu'? Shouldn't it be either 'u + qu' or 'w + kw'? I'm looking into [[WT:ANON]] now.
::: PS: I wonder if we should have a dedicated template for manuscript spellings, like {{temp|manuscript spelling of}}, displaying "Manuscript spelling of _" or "Alternative spelling of_, used in [some manuscripts]" (the last part could even allow specific manuscripts(s) to be named as parameter(s)). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 18:03, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: I'm not sure about normalising qu to kw. My reasoning is mostly that while modern German has normalised c and uu, it still retains qu in its modern spelling (although Dutch does not). Furthermore, Middle Dutch is commonly cited with qu intact as well. So it seemed more consistent to leave it like that in the Old languages as well. And yes I do think a special template would be nice. But I would suggest {{temp|unnormalized spelling of}}, so that it's immediately clear what the relationship is (as well as the fact that normalisation has been applied in the first place). However, this may be confusing if both the unnormalised and normalised spellings occur in the actual documents, such as Old Saxon terms spelled with either v or ƀ. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:09, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
::::I'm in strong favour of a template which denominates unnormalised spelling. I also think that normalisation should only include native phonemes. Thus, I would eradicate ''qu'' from it because, in Germanic languages, neither do ''kw'' and ''qu'' contrast, nor is there a /q/ phoneme, nor is /u/ part of <qu>. Also, for Old Saxon in specific, I'd like to rediscuss <v>, which indicates /v/, where [β] was used. Which makes me ask: Are you intending this to be guidelines which are followed due to politeness or would it lead to votes turning them policies?[[User:Korn|Korn]] ([[User talk:Korn|talk]]) 18:28, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: It seems to me that that goes further than the intended purpose of normalisation. Normalisation is not the same as completely respelling the words to be phonemic. It's meant only to standardise on spelling variations for ease of use, and to introduce modern distinctions between letters that were not known to ancient writers (mostly concerning I and U). A 'common denominator' spelling if you will. I'm not sure about the exact pronunciation of /v/ in Old Saxon. In Germanic it was indeed [β], and presumably it remained bilabial until after Old Saxon and Old High German split, because OHG has [b]. But in Old Saxon texts, in words with Germanic *b, some writers use ƀ while others use v. Old Dutch and Old Frisian texts use v exclusively, while OHG texts write mostly b, and Old Norse and Old English write only f. On the other hand, in later Old Dutch and also High and Low German, the letter v starts to be used to represent *f as well, showing initial and medial voicing of voiceless fricatives.
::::: And no I'm not intending this to be a formal policy, I'm only hoping to establish some kind of common practice, and to have it in writing that normalisations are... well, the norm on Wiktionary. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:44, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::How about {{temp|historical/attested spelling of}} and {{temp|normalised spelling}} alongside each other?[[User:Korn|Korn]] ([[User talk:Korn|talk]]) 20:32, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::Do you intend {{temp|normalised spelling}} as a context template? (Main entries need no form-of templates.) If so, what do we do when the normalised spelling is also attested, include {{temp|attested spelling of}} on one line and {{temp|normalised spelling}} on the next, or use {{temp|context|attested and normalised spelling}}? I would prefer we leave normalised entries unmarked: we needn't mark them as attested when they ''are'' also attested, just as we needn't mark "[[bird#English|bird]]" as referring to a feathered-wing-having, egg-laying animal in the New York dialect, because it refers to the same thing in most other dialects of English... and we needn't mark them as normalised, lest we wrongly imply they aren't attested when they are. (But I understand the value of noting which spellings are attested and which are normalised, so I might could be persuaded to support such templates and context tags as an obvious way of presenting such information, though usage notes might be better.)
::::::Another idea for the manuscript spellings: (e.g. for [[[[ec]]]]:) <nowiki># {{context|in the Codex Regius}} {{alternative spelling of|ek}}</nowiki>. Any dedicated template would also work in place of {{temp|alternative spelling of}} in that example... now I'm just not sure if including the manuscript's name as a context or after the "alt spelling of _" bit looks better.

:::::::I mean {{temp|normalised}} as in {{temp|slang}} or {{temp|archaic}}, what are those called? I'm thinking about languages where some words' normalised spellings were never used by native speakers or during that period while others were. So that any entry could be either having-been-used-historically or normalised or both and hence would need separate markers to be informative. So I would propose two tags {{temp|normalised (spelling)}} and {{temp|historic (spelling)}} (which would not collide with archaic/obsolite since those are reserved for living languages). Historic would, when not accompanied by ''normalised'' then be followed by sth. like ''see [normalised form]]''. I'm not fond of ''alternative spelling'' because historical spellings are no alternative to normalised spellings an modern-academic context and normalised spellings were not applied by native writers. Furthermore: Couldn't we extend the normalisation to modern languages lacking codification/official rules and thus end a good deal of the problems within Low German?[[User:Korn|Korn]] ([[User talk:Korn|talk]]) 22:39, 7 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: We should be recording the forms that are used.

== A separate category tree for forms ==

A few weeks ago, someone suggested at [[WT:ID#Category of all forms]] to create a separate category tree for non-lemmas. I do see some merit in the suggestion, as it would make it a bit easier for editors and users alike to keep lemmas and non-lemmas apart. On the other hand, it isn't always clear what is a lemma and what isn't. Participles are a notorious example. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:17, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

: But "non-lemma" is not a coherent concept, is it? I mean, what does it say about a word that it's not a lemma? —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 20:34, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
:: Supposedly, lemmas may be created through derivation, whereas non-lemmas are created through inflection. If something is not a lemma on Wiktionary it means we don't have a self-sufficient definition for the term, but rather link to another term which has the proper definition. Conjugated verb forms and declined forms of nominals would be examples. Participles, verbal nouns and degrees of comparison are a bit of a grey area, as they may have definitions in some languages (such as in Latin) but not in others (English), and often have secondary senses not readily derivable from their status as inflected forms, so that they can be considered both lemmas and non-lemmas at the same time. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:16, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
::: That distinction doesn't hold up.  The Romance language verb forms (non-lemmata) ''derive'' from Latin verb forms.  The choice of the lemma for a word is actually arbitrary, as the plurals and gendered forms of words usually derive from a corresponding form in the parent language.  Wiktionary, like other dictionaries, simply chooses one of the various forms to be place-holder for the word in all forms, and that choice, although conventionally consistent, is nonetheless arbitrary. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 22:01, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: Of course it is arbitrary, but since categories on Wiktionary are also arbitrary, there is no harm in allowing our categories to reflect our own internal treatment of terms. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:11, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: To what benefit?  Non-lemmata may or may not have definitions, and may or may not have translations, and ''should'' have quotations and pronunciations.  So what difference warrants a separate category structure beyond the purely arbitrary designation of some entries as non-lemmata? --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 02:57, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::I've been putting all the non-lemmata in 'non-lemmata' categories for Ancient Greek.  My reasoning is that, once we actually get a substantial number of inflected form entries, keeping noun forms in [[:Category:Ancient Greek noun forms]] helps keep [[:Category:Ancient Greek nouns]] useable.  However, as I look at it, I see that [[:Category:Ancient Greek noun forms]] is in [[:Category:Noun forms by language]], so I guess I'm not entirely certain what's being proposed here.  There is some grey area as to what is and is not a lemma entry.  We have some "lemma" entries for the comparative forms of adjectives (e.g. [[πρεσβύτερος]]), and I've seen them for plurals too, but I don't know if that derails the whole notion of making a distinction between the two.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 11:35, 9 April 2012 (UTC)

An exchange like ‘Gonnae no dae that!’ — ‘How no?’ — ‘Jist gonnae no!’ doesn't make sense in English but it's very common in Scotland. The problem is that several generations of Scots have been brought up to believe that the language is ‘slang’ (if my wife said {{term|ay}} or {{term|heid}} at school she was always ‘corrected’ to {{term|yes}} or {{term|head}}) and therefore it has a weird status in its home country where educated people are often embarrassed by it. When the Scottish Parliament released a version of their website in Scots a few years ago I remember it being passed round in forwarded emails among Scottish friends of mine as though it was the funniest thing ever – like a UK Parliament site in Cockney. This is changing now though, as Scottish schools have to include Scots classes and many publishers are bringing out more serious books in the language.

As Atalaes said: BP and other high-volume pages ''do'' need a new format.
But LT doesn't seem to have many friends here.

Therefore, I suggest sub-pages like the deletion log of the Italian WP. Example: [[:w:it:Wikipedia:Pagine da cancellare/Log/2008 giugno 13]].
One could create a sub-page for each new discussion, or a sub-page for each new month.
These sub-pages could be added to your normal watchlist, and without flooding your watchlist with the high-volume Beer Parlour (or similar pages).
After a certain time, one could unlink the sub-pages and link them to some archive index page.
The editing and the discussions wouldn't find place in the BP or Tea Room any more, but in their sub-pages; BP and TR would be just a list of included sub-pages.

This would also solve the problem of retrieving old discussions. Currentliy, moving discussions to an archive page kills all links and you'll have to search the archives.

Indeed, what I'm thinking about is similar to [[WT:VOTE]] (which I never have tried).
In this solution, the user should be offered a link to click on, which starts some kind of Javascript, maybe similar to the New Entry Creator by Yair rand.
It should prompt the user for a discussion title and the discussion text, like when you add a new section to a discussion page.
The discussion title should be the base of the sub-page name.
The Javascript adds the name of the parent page to the title and could prepend the current date, so sub-pages don't conflict with each other. For example: "Beer Parlour/2012-04-11 Newbie question", "Tea Room/2012-04-12 Another queston" etc.
The sub-pages should contain their own edit-links (like in WT:VOTE).
Users shouldn't be able to edit the parent page (Beer Parlour, Tee Room, Ety Scriptorium etc) in a direct way; it would be the Javascript that links or inserts the newly created sub-page into the parent page.<br>

== Moving 'pronunciation' down in ELE ==

I think it would be nice to make pronunciation one of the last sections of an entry, thereby promoting definitions. An example of an entry with long pronunciation section (much longer than its etymology section) is [[contract]]. Demoting (moving down) pronunciation should be much easier than demoting etymologies, as there are fairly many entries with multiple etymologies, and Wiktionary's entry structure makes part-of-speech headings depend on etymology headings. I know that some entries have several pronunciations, which might cause a problem, yet [[contract]] entry shows how several pronunciations, differentiated by part of speech, can be entered into one pronunciation section. Whatever the case, I think this proposal should be given some serious thought. If you know of a past discussion on the subject, please post a link to it. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:40, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

::I agree with Liliana. People expect pronunciation info at the top of an entry. Also, homographs are very often also homophones (especially in languages with better regulated spelling systems than English), so in some cases a single pronunciation can be given for a single spelling, even when multiple etymologies are listed. (See for example [[fundo#Portuguese]].) —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 11:45, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

: For the record, I have renamed the section heading of this thread to make it clearer.
: I've always thought definitions are the most important content in a dictionary. While dictionaries often do list pronunciation first, their pronunciation information takes one line rather than several; see how compact the pronunciation information is at http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/cat or at http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/cat. Furthermore, many dictionaries do not show pronunciation at all (including Merriam-Webster online), which suggests pronunciation is less important than definitions, especially to native speakers. Some online dictionaries have etymology ''below'' definitions, including Merriam-Webster, Collins and AHD. Thus, I am surprised by the responses above. I admit that I have no data on what content users of Wiktionary search most often, whether definitions, pronunciation or etymologies. What I do know is that Wiktionary has 31,445 entries with "etymology" section (found using AWB, searching for "==\s*Etymology"), and that it has 30,875 entries with "pronunciation" section (found using AWB, searching for "==\s*Pronunciation"). Thus, whatever people are searching for on Wiktionary, what they actually find are above all definitions rather then pronunciation and etymologies. On the sample of one consisting of me, definitions are content number one. The interface to Wiktionary [http://ninjawords.com/ ninjawords] only shows definitions, suggesting some other people deem definitions the most important thing. I recall DCDuring wanting to promote definitions. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 06:50, 13 April 2012 (UTC)

== Moving 'alternative forms' down in ELE ==

[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-03/Moving "Coordinate terms" up in ELE]] proposes this ordering of terms:

*'''Alternative forms'''

*'''Synonyms'''
*'''Antonyms'''
*''Other allowable -nyms''
*'''Coordinate terms'''
*'''Derived terms'''
*'''Related terms'''
*'''Translations'''
*'''Descendants'''

But we still list 'alternative forms' at the top of entries. To me it makes more sense to list it along with other terms that are related in some way to the current term. So I would like to propose modifying it to this:

*'''Alternative forms'''
*'''Synonyms'''
*'''Antonyms'''
*''Other allowable -nyms''
*'''Coordinate terms'''
*'''Derived terms'''
*'''Related terms'''
*'''Translations'''
*'''Descendants'''

Seen as the terms are listed in a general order from 'most closely related semantically' to 'least closely related semantically', the alternative forms section seems 'closer' even than synonyms, so I've placed it above it. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 12:22, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

== Renaming “context labels” ==

I'd like to reform the vocabulary surrounding our “context labels.”

{{temp|context}} is used for two different things: ''grammatical labels'' and ''usage labels'' (also called ''restricted-usage labels'').

The use of the term ''context'' is incorrect and misleading. Newb editors often think the label is supposed to represent the context of the referent (labelling [[cow]] with “''animals''”), or even that it's just something vaguely placed in the context of the entry's definition line. But the term [[context]], in corpus-based lexicography, properly refers to something different: a term's context of usage, shown in a quotation. The generic sense of ''context'' can be applied to usage labels, but in several different ways, mostly incorrect. And context has nothing to do with our so-called “grammatical context labels.”

I'd like to rename the the mechanics of these templates from ''context'' to ''label'', and sort them out functionally into ''grammatical labels'' and ''usage labels''. This relates directly to the terminology of professional lexicography (for example, s.v. “[http://books.google.ca/books?id=E67tEcfQCwoC&lpg=PA80&vq=label&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q=label&f=false label]” in Hartmann, ''Dictionary of Lexicography'').

Things that would be updated:

* {{temp|context}} → {{temp|label}}
* [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained#Context labels]]
* [[Wiktionary:Context labels]]
* [[:Category:Context labels]] → [[:Category:grammatical labels]] and [[:Category:usage labels]]

:::: Hartmann classifies various axes of usage labels, although he warns that there are no clear boundary lines: period (e.g., ''archaic/in vogue''), attitude (''appreciative/derogatory''), frequency (''basic/rare''), contact (''borrowing/vernacular''), channel (''written/spoken''), standard (''correct/incorrect''), register (''elevated/intimate''), social status (''high/demotic''), subject (''Botany''), genre (''poetic/conversational''), dialect (''American''). I have seen other classifications, and no one can really define ''slang''.

== A new vote for languages with limited documentation ==

Building on the recent failed vote for endangered languages, I have opened a new vote on [[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-04/Languages_with_limited_documentation|languages with limited documentation]]. The talk page has quite background information and summaries of some of the issues involved.

The proposal also expands the criteria for inclusion for extinct languages to include usage.

To counteract potential abuse of the single attestation proposal, a provision for each language to maintain a list of excluded sources is included. 

I hope this proposal is acceptable as a way to welcome endangered languages and other languages without a strong written tradition. [[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BenjaminBarrett12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 21:35, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

:Discussion is underway on the talk page about whether this vote should propose a list (which might be long) of specific languages with sparse documentation that would be allowed with fewer citations, or whether this vote should merely allow "those languages listed at [[[[WT:CFI/some-subpage]]]]", with ''separate votes'' populating that subpage.

Belatedly pursuant to [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour archive/2011/October#Trademarks]], I've set up the concise page [[WT:TM]], mostly using the language bd suggested at the end of that old BP discussion. Comments, critiques? Should we ultimately vote to make it a policy?

I nominated this template for deletion [[WT:RFDO#Template:languagex]].

==Regarding Georgian verbs ==
Well, because I received so many replies saying [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion/Others#Template:ka-verb "Oh yeah, of course", "OMG why didnt we discuss that before?", etc.] I have decided to move discussion into here to talk in depth :D.
OK, if, here too, I got no replies, I would:
# establish, I understand how strange it may sound, 8 forms of third-person present (or sometimes future) and verbal nouns as lemmas, this means we will have to define at most 9 forms. 
::GED has the same rule (in fact I'm talking about GED's rules :D)
::one of the main reasons why we should not use only a verbal noun as a lemma is that not all verbs have a verbal noun. another is that verbal nouns don't express any features of Georgian verbs except aspect and the meaning :D
::similarly, I use future tense because not all verbs have a present form.
::Choosing a verb form as a lemma eases by many aspects, for example sometimes it is too artificial to transform a common Georgian proverb (verbal part of which is verb form) into a proverb with a verbal noun in it.
# create ka-verbal _noun
# create ka-verb_link and link all possible lemmas from a verbal noun article.
# make use of ka-verb for lemmas, but as opposed to la-verb, ka-verb will also add //category:verb form//

In a nutshell,  I'll copy the contents from GED first :D (preserving even the way of defining). While copying (:D) I/we may encounter a problem (less probable though) or a better way may strike on our heads, but that wouldn't be a problem (using our lovely bots :D).

== [[emo]] ety ==

Our ety says that [[emo]] was a contraction of [[emocore]]. Can anyone confirm or deny this?

However, I ''am'' used to any given genre ''X'' getting an ''Xcore'' later in its life, e.g. ''funkcore'', ''rapcore'', ''skacore'', so it makes me suspicious.

== Deleting "his" in CFI ==

Along the lines of [[Wiktionary:CFI#Pronouns]], it seems that the sentence:

==Featured entries==

As [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3Ah%C3%A1%C4%8Dek&diff=16696298&oldid=16369481 I wrote] in [[Talk:háček#Featured entry?]]:<br/>With ninety-five supporting quotations for its various forms, {{m|en|háček}} is very probably this project's best-attested lexeme. I've never seen an entry with pronunciatory transcriptions for as many accents and/or speech standards, as many attested synonyms, or as many supporting references. It has a full etymology, going back to Proto forms, and includes parallel formations and cognates; moreover, it has fourteen attested variant spellings, an illustrative image, three derived terms, two lists of coördinate terms, translations into twenty-one languages, two external links, and a fair few exegetic notes. Unlike Wikipedia, we don't have "featured articles" (though our equivalents here would be "featured ''entries''"), but I think we should, because this would allow us to draw attention to our lexicographically best entries, which would in turn function as ''beaux idéals'' to inspire more entries of such calibre.<br/>So, what do y'all say? Should we have featured entries? and does {{term||háček}} make the grade? — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 22:33, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:: The main criterion for a given word's [[WT:WOTDN|selection as a word of the day]] is "exotic usefulness". Very often, a word will be selected to be a word of the day whose entry is pretty {{l|en|barebones}} — featuring only the minimum of proper formatting — it matters only that the definition(s) be interesting. By contrast, the criterion I have in mind for an entry's selection as a featured entry is "completeness". Besides more translations, I can't really think of anything ''left'' that could be added to our English entry for {{term||háček}}; that's why I think it should be a featured entry. — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 16:45, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

:I've been detailing the many pronunciations of [[[[pecan]]]], Liliana has filled out the translations of [[[[water]]]] and Beobach filled up the semantic relations of [[[[iron]]]] (the entry also has full trans tables) and worked on [[[[line]]]] (sorry if I've missed anyone else's greatly-improved entries)... and [[[[mole]]]] has the potential to be turned into a model multiple-etymology entry... the problem in having a Wikipedia-like featuring of entries is that we would run out of such massively-detailed entries, because we have only a few.

[[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 23:13, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Yes, you get the idea. (It's great to see such detailed entries — very enheartening!) I don't think we need Wikipedia's {{l|en|bumph}} — just [[:Category:Featured entries|a category]] would be fine, linked to by [[commons:File:Cscr-featured.svg|a little bronze star]] just under the language name.

:The French Wiktionary tried tagging "entries of quality", but the project ground rapidly to a halt.  We don't have the kind of group efforts going into entries that Wikipedia has, in part because of our extremely small regularly contributing staff, each member of which has a particular sphere of knowledge that often does not overlap with others.  We also run into the issue of whether non-English entries could qualify, and then it becomes a swamping effort in a few languages, with no qualified editors to review the nominations.  What I did try to start was a "model entries" effort, but that was designed to include a very small number of words to act as models, which meant that they needed to meet certain ''a priori'' criteria, such as few PoS sections, breadth of translatability, simplicity and universality of the senses defined, etc.  Many excellent entries on Wiktionary would not be useful as models because of the entry's overwhelming complexity.  We;ve discussed the idea of "featured" entries before, and I still haven't heard a viable proposal that makes sense to bother trying.  Unlike Wikipedia, we can't feature an "intertesting" toppic; we'd be featuring thorough dictionary entries, which do not lend themselves to casual reading. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 06:21, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

:: I agree that having comprehensive lexica is a greater priority than accomplishing the exhaustive analysis of a few words, but there's no reason that exhibiting such detailed entries should lead to a diminution of efforts to include stubby entries. Some people prefer adding the kind of "barebones" entry I describe above (comprising a language header, a POS header, a headword line, and a definition or small group of definitions), whilst others prefer to {{l|en|flesh out}} entries until they're really meaty (carnal metaphor aside, you get my meaning). {{l|en|let a thousand flowers bloom|Let a thousand flowers bloom}} and all that. — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 16:45, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

== Discoverability for cites/quotes ==

As noted at [[Wiktionary:Feedback#verisimilitude]], it's not always obvious to WT users where to find sample uses.  When citations exist for an entry, should we have some way of transcluding them right into the entry itself, probably under an L3/L4 header?  Or if that's too technically messy, perhaps we could add an L3/L4 header for quotations, link to the Citations page there, and explain to users that they should click through to see quotations?  --  [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr Útlendi]] │ <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala við mig]]''</small> 06:43, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

Discussions at [[Wiktionary:Grease pit]] have led some editors to suggest that we require entries to use e.g. {{temp|context|medicine}} rather than e.g. {{temp|medicine}}.

Some reasons for this suggestion:

* Some editors feel that part of the complexity of {{temp|context}}'s implementation is due to support for entries' using {{temp|medicine}} directly. (I don't really agree with this view, personally, but it seems to have been the original motivation for the suggestion, hence my mentioning it.)
* This would allow sense labels to be searchable. Right now {{argwiktlink|link=Special:Search?search=slang+forgetful&ns0=1|disp=a Wiktionary search for "slang" + "forgetful"}} won't find [[[[spacer]]]], because that entry uses {{temp|slang}} directly; but it ''would'' find it if the entry used {{temp|context|slang}} instead.
* Currently, we have some inconsistency in that {{temp|context|medicine}} and {{temp|medicine}} are equivalent but {{temp|context|law}} and {{temp|law}} are not (because the latter is a language template rather than a context template), and {{temp|context|obstetrics}} and {{temp|obstetrics}} are not (because the latter doesn't exist).
* There are some downsides to the fact that {{temp|context|medicine}} invokes {{temp|medicine}} rather than (say) {{temp|context/medicine}}; for example, the existence of {{temp|law}} as a language template means that {{temp|context|law}} can't be used for legal entries (we've had to require that {{temp|context|legal}} be used instead; {{temp|law}} can't even be a redirect).
** Technically this is a somewhat separate issue, in that forbidding {{temp|medicine}} from being called directly is not equivalent to having {{temp|context}} call {{temp|context/medicine}}; and indeed, the downsides that I mentioned could be addressed by having {{temp|context|medicine}} invoke {{temp|context/medicine}} while keeping {{temp|medicine}} as syntactic sugar for {{temp|context|medicine}}; but some editors seem to be opposed to the idea of having two templates for every sense label.
* This would make it easier for consumers of our content (mirrors, applications, and whatnot) to recognize sense labels.
* This would make it easier for bots to recognize sense labels. (For example, a bot that recognizes {{temp|context|...}} in non-English sections and adds <tt>lang=xx</tt> would no longer have to search for and recognize every single context template.)
* This would arguably be more sensible when multiple unrelated sense labels appear together; for example, if you think about it, it's rather bizarre to combine {{temp|rare}} and {{temp|medicine}} as {{temp|rare|medicine}} (where {{temp|rare}} is the template and <tt>medicine</tt> is an argument to it), whereas {{temp|context|rare|medicine}} (where both are arguments to {{temp|context}}) makes more sense.
** This could, of course, be treated more narrowly: we could allow {{temp|context|rare}} to be written as {{temp|rare}} when that's the only label, while forbidding something like {{temp|rare|medicine}}.
* Currently, every context template more or less needs to support every parameter to {{temp|context}}; for example, the fact that {{temp|medicine}} doesn't support <tt>script=</tt> means that {{temp|medicine|literary}} doesn't, either, even though {{temp|context|literary}} ''does''.
** Granted, ''merely'' requiring {{temp|context|medicine}} wouldn't solve this problem, because currently, {{temp|context|medicine|literary}} also depends on {{temp|medicine}} to pass parameters to {{temp|literary}}; ''that'', however, can be fixed, whereas ''this'' cannot.
** And of course, this too would be addressed if we forbade {{temp|medicine|literary}} but allowed bare {{temp|medicine}}.

If we do make this change, we could do it pretty gradually; it wouldn't have to happen overnight. For example, we could use these steps:

# Create a one-time bot to convert existing instances of {{temp|medicine}} to {{temp|context|medicine}}.
# Create a long-running bot, à la AutoFormat, that would convert new instances, until people get used to the idea.
# Eventually modify {{temp|medicine}} to call attention to itself on preview, and start sending polite notices to people who keep using it.
# At some point during this process, modify {{temp|context}} to use e.g. {{temp|context/medicine}} rather than {{temp|medicine}}.
# Eventually modify {{temp|medicine}} to call attention to itself even ''not'' on preview, e.g. adding a cleanup category rather than a sense label.
# Eventually delete {{temp|medicine}}.

: [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|20px]] '''Support'''.  ''However'', I am profoundly confused about the historical background for why {{temp|context|law}} doesn't work.  The first arg to {{temp|context}} is apparently checked to see if there's a template by that name.  This is based on the frighteningly spaghettified cross-calling that this discussion ostensibly seeks to simplify.  If we scrap this difficult-to-understand and difficult-to-maintain cross-calling and only look at {{temp|context}} alone (ideally, from my perspective, even going so far as to expressly disallow and remove specific labeling templates such as {{temp|medicine}}), there would be no need for this template check, and {{temp|context|law}} (and any other context labels that also happen to be language labels or the names of any other templates) would then work as expected.  <small>(''As an aside:''  I suspect we'll go through this again once we have Lua functionality -- much of this will be infinitely simpler once we have a proper programming language to play with.)</small>  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr Útlendi]] │ <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala við mig]]''</small> 22:16, 20 April 2012 (UTC)
:: No, sorry, you're being a bit too optimistic. {{temp|context}} will still have to check to see if its arguments have corresponding templates, because those templates are the only way, short of some sort of terrible <tt>#switch:</tt>, to treat each argument in its own way (adding entry to the right grammatical category or the right topical category or no category, linking to the right entry or the right glossary entry or nothing, etc.). In this respect, the problem with the current approach is that not that it requires a template for each more-than-just-text label, and not that it checks for that template, but rather, that it uses a conflict-prone naming convention (namely: none), and that it checks for conflicts by doing horrible things. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 22:41, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

:Generally it seems a quite sensible thing for one dictionary to avoid {{temp|medicine}} in favor of {{temp|context/medicine}}) - I for myself was confused when first encountered one of those as to what its purpose was. I don't remember which one it was. But now that I am aware of them, I am not that sure that it's the best idea to completely disband all of these special templates for sense labels like {{temp|legal}} is. For example, I think that {{temp|legal|medicine}} or {{temp|medicine|law}} could convey its purpose through its name and usage rather easily as a label for medical jurisprudence sense. And then there's this laziness factor when typing the templates manually.

== Collocations section in entries? ==

Because of our idiomaticity requirement, we do not have entries for common collocations that have meanings that can be derived from their parts. However, it would be incredibly useful to language learners to be able to find some common collocations and phrases, even if they are not idiomatic. A common question for learners is 'how do I say (phrase) in (language)?' So I would like to propose adding such a section to [[WT:ELE]]. I'm not sure whether it would be useful to English entries, but for people who are learning English or have a non-native command, it would still be nice to list them even if we don't give definitions. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:54, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

: That makes sense to me. I sometimes give such collocations in example sentences (or ''as'' example "sentences", if I'm feeling lazy), but giving them their own section would have a number of benefits over that: (1) it would make it less problematic to linkify them if they're reasonably idiomatic, and perhaps to linkify their other component words if not; (2) it would make it less problematic to tag them with qualifiers such as {{qualifier|UK}}; (3) it would make it less problematic to list multiple variants. I also sometimes give them in usage notes, but that's unwieldy in a different way. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:22, 21 April 2012 (UTC)

That means we would have to redefine one or more of those terms in our own habitual thinking. Which would seem the most natural? I fear that "Phrases" and "Idioms" are too easily confused with the L3 PoS headers(though "Idiom" is not used in English any more).

== Middle English cutoff ==

Currently, [[WT:AEN]] (and the ISO) makes 1500 the cutoff before which texts are Middle English and after which they're modern English. This is also the date I've always used, and the one Prosfilaes favored [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification&oldid=16723499#tyme at RFV#tyme]; on the other hand, Raifʻhār suggested 1470 in the same RFV and Leasnam suggested 1470 [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AnWulf&oldid=16621362#mensk on AnWulf's talk page]. Νικα suggested 1475 in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour archive/2007/April#Middle_English|the only old discussion I can find]]. Those thirty years make a difference, as some terms fail RFV because their latest quotations are pre-1500 (and perhaps others pass with quotations from 1475-1499). Has there been more discussion of this cutoff that I'm not finding? Are we content with 1500 (in which case, let this be an announcement that that ''is'' our current policy), or would someone like to propose pushing the cutoff back (in which case, do so)? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 23:36, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

:Presumably it wouldn't be very smart to treat this too rigidly, whatever year we decide.  If a term is in common usage throughout the 1300's and 1400's, and then has a single quote in 1490, it's clearly Middle English.  In order for it to be treated as English, it'd have to have some significant usage past the era border, going into at least 1550 or so. {{unsigned|Atelaes|23:54, 23 April 2012 (UTC)}}

:: I'm a big fan of bright lines; if there's three quotes ten years past the line, then it may be Middle English, but it's clearly also (Early) Modern English. (One quote doesn't meet CFI for Modern English.) I don't see substantial gains from a fuzzy border that offset the loss in clarity and consistency.

:::Cutoffs always have negative side-effects, but 1500 is a date devoid of intrinsic meaning. An oft-cited date is '''1476''', when the first book was printed in Britain (by [[w:William Caxton]]). The diffusion of printing presses quickly set a standard, namely the London dialect, which overtook most local dialects and led to spelling standardization. I doubt that anyone can find an entry that exists only on the merit of those 24 years. --[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup> 23:59, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

== quotations of Middle English in English entries ==
Closely related to the question of a cutoff date is the question: should we quote Middle English texts, especially in Middle English form, in ==English== sections? This has come up at [[Talk:warish]]. <br> Raifʻhār and I opined in the RFV of undeadliness ([[Talk:undeadliness]]) that books like those quoted in support of [[[[undeadliness]]]] constitute ‘translations’ of Middle English texts into English, and can be cited as English uses of terms: but the pre-1500 editions are clearly Middle English, and it seems to me no less inappropriate to quote them in ==English== sections than to quote late Latin texts in Italian entries. I would favor creating ==Middle English== sections to house the Middle English quotations. but we should come to a decision as a community about what to do. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:22, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:It's all very well to say that 1500 is a "cutoff", but what's it based on? It's pure convention. Look at the texts from around then, you will see there is a perfect continuity of language across this so-called division. In some cases you will have the ridiculous situation of having volumes I and II of a work under Middle English and volumes III and IV under modern English. Look at any citation-based dictionary and you will see citations stretching back at least to the Middle English period: it's a crucial way of showing, under a given headword, how the language has evolved over time. I have no objections to Middle English entries (though I'm not sure who is working on them), but I do object strongly to excluding these citations from modern English entries as well. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 06:29, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Again, it's not because they don't use Middle English headers that they see the need to include Middle English citations under English headwords. It's because this is a crucial part of illustrating a word's history. The OED has links with the [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&id=MED36797&egs=all Middle English Dictionary] and all their entries are linked to that where appropriate. It would be easy for them to defer such citations to that site, but they still keep Middle English under English headwords. Why? Because otherwise words and senses would appear to pop into existence from nowhere. We need to show the history of a word's use. It's the basic requirement of citation-based lexicography. I don't know what the point of a Middle English section is, maybe someone interested in just that period wants to work on it. I am not interested in that, I am interested in the history of English words, and like any good dictionary I want Wiktionary to illustrate that. The situation is nothing like Old English, which had grammatical gender and a case system and was a vastly different language from what came after. The change from Old to Middle English is also marked by a gap in the records, so there is a clean break. None of this is true for Middle English. Perhaps you only work with modern sources, or perhaps you aren't interested in citations at all, I don't know. But I work a lot with texts from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and I'm telling you the distinction makes no sense when it comes to citations. English words did not pop into existence in 1500; by 1500, they had already been evolving in certain ways which we need to be able to demonstrate. I am not looking to include ''all'' Middle English words routinely undfer an English header; all I'm saying is that where a modern English word goes back to Middle English, that should be illustrated in the citation evidence. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 08:16, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

We have entries with Middle English headers? 

Seems clear that quotations in the entry are to demonstrate usage in the language of the header, while the full list of quotations on [[Citations:]] pages shows the word's history.

We should clarify our inclusion of quotations. I think they should all be listed on the Citations pages, and select ones could also appear in entries.

How much Middle English do we want to include as English, though? I mean: do we want to do away with Middle English sections entirely in those cases, and/or include in the English section any grammatical information (especially when it comes to pronouns), any pronunciation info, etc, or do we want to include only the quotations? Do we want to duplicate the quotations (have them also in the ==Middle English== sections, even when they are in the ==English== sections)?

== Q about redirects ==

There is a certain class of Japanese nouns that can also be used as verbs.  In specific contexts, these can be verbs as-is, whereas in other contexts, they require the auxiliary verb [[する]] to impart various kinds of conjugational information.  This [[する]] is a full verb in its own right, equating more or less to the English {{m|en|do}}, and thus [noun] + [[する]] is essentially an SOP entry.

To avoid SOP-ness, and since these [noun] terms can also act as a verb on its own, Haplology and I have been adding the verb senses to the bare term entries themselves.  This raises the question of how to ensure that a Wiktionary user who might not be fluent in Japanese would find these entries if they enter [noun][[する]] into the URL or search bar.

In a thread in the Grease pit ([[Wiktionary:GREASE#How_the_search_feature_works_.28and_doesn.27t_work.29]]), Ruakh clued me in to the possibility of using a do-nothing template param that would hold a string intended to generate a search hit.  This does work to some extent, but only when a user uses the search feature.  Typing this string into the URL fails out, whereas a redirect would work.

Since the [noun][[する]] combination is perforce specific to Japanese, and since a redirect would thus not affect any other language, would other editors be opposed to using redirects from the SOP (but common in English-language teaching materials) [noun][[する]] forms to the [noun] entries?  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr Útlendi]] │ <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala við mig]]''</small> 06:25, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

:I support using redirects. We usually don't use redirects, because they're usually inappropriate, but this is a perfect example of when to use redirects. To a limited extent, we already use similar redirects from phrases that are SOP in English to the idiomatic parts thereof ([[win-win situation]]→[[win-win]]).

== Modern Latin ==

Due to Latin being an extinct language, one citation is sufficient for each term. However, the posts above about Middle English led me to this question: are modern usages of Latin acceptable? What if a term is only used in medieval texts? Based on how often I see "New Latin", I'd guess there are a fair few of them. I also think we ought to accept them, when tagged as not being Classical. 

The issue is really about words that are only found in 20th and 21st century works. I am currently reading ''[[w:la:Winnie Ille Pu|Winnie ille Pu]]'' and I plan sometime soon to read ''[[w:la:Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis|Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis]]''. There are some words in these that are clearly legitimate (like [[w:la:Hamaxostichus|hamaxostichus]]), but describe things that did not exist before the modern age (in this case, trains). Am I justified in adding them with a citation from such a work? --[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup> 00:15, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Re: Your first sentence: Sorry, I don't see what you're getting at.

No? You say that you interpret "contemporaneous" differently, but you don't say how you interpret it. I don't think this discussion can proceed any further until you explain that.
:: Re: Hebrew: we've decided to treat all forms of Hebrew as a single language, so it's not extinct. If we decided instead to treat Ancient Hebrew and Modern Hebrew as separate languages (as Ethnologue does), then we'd have to figure out how we distinguish them, and terms like "extinct" and "contemporaneous" would presumably fall out naturally from that.

:::Essentially my argument is that your interpretation of contemporaneous is just that - your personal interpretation without the vote giving any indication that that's what it means.

In general, to rebut an interpretation, you need to provide either a reason to think that it's wrong, or else a reason to think that some other interpretation is as valid or more so. Describing an interpretation as a "personal interpretation", without offering any alternative, is pretty useless, except that sometimes it can be a decent way to infuriate someone.

== Implied nouns ==

I recently expanded {{m|grc|τέταρτος||fourth|tr=tetartos}}, and I came upon some difficulty in conveying some of the information in proper Wiktionary fashion.  In its primary sense, the definition is fairly straightforward, it's the ordinal version of {{m|grc|τέσσαρες||four}}.  However, some of its other senses, while fairly intuitive to understand, are somewhat difficult to rigorously explain.  For example, definition 3.2 means [[quart]], as in a liquid measure.  That definition is essentially when {{m|grc|τέταρτος}} is attached to {{m|grc|μοῖρα||part, portion}}.  The word {{m|grc|μοῖρα||part, portion}} doesn't actually have to be in the clause, or the paragraph, or even the work for that matter.  It can be implied by the context, as it is in the Herodotus work cited for it (follow the link, if you don't believe me).  I'm almost positive English can do similar things, but I'm at a loss as to think of any examples.  My reference (the LSJ 8th edition) uses the syntax "(sub. {{lang|grc|μοῖρα}})" to explain the grammar, with sub. being listed in the list of abbreviations as "subaudi", which is absolute jibberish to me, but I was already aware of the phenomenon, and so understood anyway.  My solution is {{temp|grc-sub.}}, which simply makes a {{temp|context}} like parenthetical note "with x".  Obviously, this should eventually get an appendix, but I don't have the gumption to write one up on the spot.  In any case, does anyone have any thoughts on how to more clearly explicate this in a definition list?  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 02:38, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

:It sounds like it means "fourth (part); quart, quarter". My question is whether it functions as a noun in such cases? Or is it a "substantive adjective"? Either way it looks like you are explaining it just fine to be honest. Good citations (some with and some without "part") will make the phenomenon fairly clear in any case. <span class="latinx" >[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</span> 05:40, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

::My experience, in Ancient Greek at least, is that nouns and substantive adjectives function identically: they both function as grammatical nouns, take the definite article, can be modified by adjectives, etc.  Some adjectives strongly prefer a certain gender, and usually function as substantives, and it can be only determined on scant evidence that they even are adjectives ({{m|grc|θεός}} is an example that comes to mind).  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 11:30, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::: I see it's being used now at both [[τέταρτος]] and [[τοξικός]], but it raises a more general question about how to treat substantivized adjectives: shouldn't these forms be listed under the genders where they actually occur, and then under a ==Noun== header? After all, what we have here synchronically is a feminine noun [[τετάρτη]] that means both "quart" and "the fourth day"; the fact that it's elliptical for τετάρτη μοῖρα is really just part of its etymology. Likewise there's a neuter noun [[τέταρτον]] that means "a fourth, a quarter", a feminine noun [[τοξική]] that means both "archery" and "a shothole", a masculine noun [[τοξικός]] that means "a bowman" (attested only in the plural), and a neuter noun [[τοξικόν]] that means "poison for smearing arrows with".

::::::::: We do have separate entries for [[dogs]] and [[dog]], and [[messages]] and [[message]], but I was quite unhappy that we had some senses at [[messages]] that we didn't even point to from [[message]]. I'm happy with entries like [[bang]] and [[scissor]], and the current revision of [[message]], which I edited so that it does point out the additional definitions at the plural form. ([[line|Line]] similarly has a sense which should technically be [[the line]].) If we move these elliptical senses to specifically gendered inflected forms, we'll need to point them out in usage notes in the lemma entries (like [[messages]]), or how will anyone ever find them? Contributors who know none of the language will copy-and-paste the term and get the right page, but contributors who know enough of the language to search for the lemma, aware that our inflected forms almost never contain information beyond "Foo form of [[bar]]", won't find the senses.

:::::::::: I disagree with the current state of [[message]] and [[messages]], since now the meaning "groceries, shopping" is not listed in a definition line anywhere. It's in a usage note at [[message]] and hidden on the Citations page at [[messages]]. As for the Greek forms, I would actually list the noun meanings under Derived forms of the adjective's lemma. Readers who know enough Ancient Greek to be looking for nouns like [[τετάρτη]] will know enough to look for it under its nominative singular [[τετάρτη]] (as opposed to one of the other cases, or the plural), but if they only encounter it ''as a noun'' they will probably ''not'' look for it under the masculine adjective form [[τέταρτος]]--you can't tell from looking at τετάρτη that it's "basically" an adjective rather than a noun. In a paper dictionary that's not such a big deal, because if you look up [[τετάρτη]] you will immediately see the adjective [[τέταρτος]] and will look there instead. But here, if I encounter a noun [[τετάρτη]] in my Greek reading and come to Wiktionary and look for it there, and all that page tells me it that it's an inflected form of the adjective [[τέταρτος]], I'll be confused because what I have on my page is a noun ending in -η, not an adjective ending in -ος. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 19:57, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Flemish language]] and [[Template:vls]] ==

This category failed RFD a while ago, and it is now almost empty, with most of its contents having been moved to Dutch. What should we do with its code, {{temp|vls}}? Wikipedia uses that code specifically for West Flemish ([http://vls.wikipedia.org/ West Flemish Wikipedia]), and I think that would make sense because there is a stronger consensus within the linguistic community that it is a language, at least compared to Flemish/Belgian Dutch in general. It's not recognised politically as a language, but still. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:37, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

== $wgPFEnableStringFunctions ==

The [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions ParserFunctions] extension now includes string functions, but these need to be enabled separately. As of right now this is disabled, so the string functions don't work. I'd like to vote to enable these. Of all the Wikipedia wikis I can think of, Wiktionary would probably be able to make the most use of string functions, because we work with words so much. These functions would allow us to write templates that automatically adjust endings added to words based on the page name. So for example, {{temp|en-noun}} would add -s for the plural most of the time, but it could automatically add -es or replace -y with -ies when appropriate, and without needing an additional parameter. Similarly, it would allow a template like {{temp|fr-conj-er}} and many other inflection templates to drop the 'stem' parameter, because for a word like [[chanter]] the string functions could automatically extract the 'chant-' from the page name. This makes templates much less error-prone because of forgotten or mistaken parameters and such. There are of course many other possibilities. In any case I think these would be incredibly useful and I don't really see any problems at all. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:15, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

== Proto-Slavic: Why are ь and ъ used for ĭ and ŭ? ==

I've been wondering this for a while now. All other sources I came across about Slavic so far use the Latin letters ĭ and ŭ and not the Cyrillic equivalents. Even our own transliteration of Old Church Slavonic uses those letters. So why not in Proto-Slavic? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:47, 27 April 2012 (UTC)
:I've seen both used, but I think ь and ъ are more common, especially in more modern sources. The same is true of transliterated OCS, but only when the Cyrillic isn't also provided. Since we provide both Cyrillic and Latin for OCS, it would be redundant to use ь/ъ in both, but for Proto-Slavic we only provide Latin, so it isn't redundant. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 00:11, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

::I believe the reason for this is that the precise phonetic values of ь and ъ are not known for certain, and representing them as ĭ and ŭ might be incorrect. In the case of OCS, that language is still spoken (for liturgical purposes) and we know its phonology. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 05:03, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

: ''[[w:yer|Jers]]'' in Proto-Slavic reconstructions are usually not transliterated into Latin. Cyrillic characters are used simply because it's the most common practice in the books/papers. It's quite common for OCS too, but as Angr explained it doesn't really make sense for us to use it. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 20:13, 6 May 2012 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Cajun French language]] ==

To my surprise, we have a [[:Category:Cajun French language]] and a {{temp|frc}}.

Cajun French and Quebec French have very limited syntactic, pronunciatory and lexical differences from the French spoken in Europe and around the world, just as Southern US English and Canadian English have limited syntactic, pronunciatory and lexical differences from the English spoken in Europe and around the world; I do not think it is appropriate to treat either as a separate language, and as Quebec French is already not treated as separate, I think it is especially odd to treat Cajun French as separate.

== Taxonomic names ==

I am trying to straighten out taxonomic names. It is not something that I can specify in advance, in the abstract. Those folks who have more subject area knowledge and might be able to specify everything in advance decline to get involved. 

First I am trying to have a basic standard layout. I only have a few of the easier elements laid out. I view the effort as at a stage of trying to facilitate the accumulation of information from other wikis. I would like to keep it easy to take advantage of wikipedia's and wikispecies information on vernacular names. They both have vernacular names for multiple languages at entries that tend to be at taxonomic names. A list of English synonyms is common at WP. For now, I intend to use translation tables to accumulate vernacular names which are not, strictly speaking synonyms, not really being appropriate for the same context and the synonyms headers for both taxonomic synonyms and English vernacular names. 

For some entries where there is information at WP on the geographic spread of the species or genus I have experimented with translation requests. That is what happened on that table you removed. If you would like to participate in this, I am trying to start a discussion at [[Wiktionary Talk:About Translingual#Translation of Translingual words]].

I just realised that we have way too many nouns. The vast majority of our noms and set words are nouns. Now, nouns happen to be my favourite part of speech by far, but I still think we need to space it out (i.e., not have more than four or so nouns in a row, like we currently have set). So, just a thought. --[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 04:20, 10 September 2012 (UTC)
: I also noticed that when adding the FWOTDs, the problem is that most interesting terms tend to be nouns. To be honest it’s not something I’m worrying about very much. What we could do from now on is setting FWOTDs randomly (always within the next 30 days or so), thus leaving gaps for the other to fill up if he thinks there is too much repetition (of POS, language family, context, etc.).

I just realized that this template doesn't support multiscriptal languages (think Serbo-Croatian). Check out what happens when I try to do it using the <tt>tr=</tt> parameter:
{{FWOTD|sh|сјевер|{{l|sh|sjever}}||north|pos=noun}}

And even if that worked, it still wouldn't be a great solution, because other dialects use [[śever]] or even [[sever]]. This also arbitrarily decides that the Cyrillic comes first.

== Audio files. ==

Boa! Realmente é capaz de demorar uns tempos. Talvez um robot tratasse disto num instante, como alguém no wikcionário francês quer fazer, mas eles têm que criar quase todos os artigos.
Só um pormenor: Já que se edita, porque não acrescentar o IPA (ou [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfabeto_fon%C3%A9tico_internacional AFI - Alfabeto fonético internacional] como tem [[Lisboa]]? É copiar os símbolos dos artigos da Wikipedia inglesa e meter no "Template" "{{IPA|pt|/liʒbuə/|a=PT}}".

Vou pedir a um amigo meu para acrescentá-los numa versão do [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Lista_de_concelhos_por_NUTS Anexo:Lista de concelhos por NUTS] que está a fazer para a en-wikipedia, pois o "Template" IPA lá  ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈβɾɐ̃tɨʃ|-|Pt-pt Abrantes FF.ogg}}) dá para juntar o IPA/AFI e o som, como se pode ver comparando "São Paulo" na pt-wiki e na en-wiki. Assim é só ir buscar a informação à lista e não aos artigos!!!! Lembrei-me agora que talvez seja só uma questão de traduzir o Template inglês para português... Ou copiá-lo para aqui???

Talvez depois acrescente à informação dos ficheiros audio, quando os dividir alfabeticamente, É que na Categoria,, por exemplo em Águeda, como tem acento, não fica com os outros "A".

== Egyptian Edits ==

Hi.

I see that you reformed the headers at ˤ3, which confirmed to the standard currently set out at Wiktionary:About Egyptian. That standard is still in draft phase, and there is discussion ongoing about these exact points on its talk page, so I was wondering whether you might want to offer some criticism of the policy as a whole - so that it can be brought more into line with wiktionary users' expectations (If so, you'll possibly want to skip past the bits on hieroglyphs).

Your changes were to divide each sub entry into its own etymology, and to shift the alternative forms out front of the POS. With regards to the first change, I'm not sure whether enough is known about Egyptian etymology to do that (But I'm sure this, and I feel it has the potential to add an extra level of clutter to pages where each PoS is a separate etymology.

With regards to the second issue, I'm less ambivalent, as, on the one hand, Egyptian varient spellings tend to be specific to particular parts of speech (i.e. if there is an etymologically linked noun and verb, they'll still probably be written differently in hieroglyphs), while on the other, I want to have the standard hieroglyphs appear first, because otherwise they come awfully late in the entry (Since, unlike in normal entries, they aren't in the title space).

Finally, I note your decision to keep [[mȝt]], which is an alternate modern transcription of [[m3t]] (Not really an alternative form in the Egyptian - both are Roman alphabetic representations of the exact same Egyptian word). There has been significant discussion of what to do about these different forms on my talk page ([[User talk:Furius#Redirects]]), which didn't really achieve a great deal of consensus (I'd been turning alternate transliterations into redirects and there were objections). I don't think it desirable to have a separate page for each of the many possible transcriptions of any given word - it's very messy, especially since some are really only typographical variants of the same transliteration system (e.g. ȝ vs 3, in which the use of ȝ is non-standard, and 3 is a fallback).
I welcome your comments on any or all of these points, as how Egyptian works on wiktionary is only in the very early stages of standardisation.
[[User:Furius|Furius]] ([[User talk:Furius|talk]]) 06:49, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

: ''(Egyptian etymology)'': really? I thought Proto-Semitic was well documented. In any case, the entries will need to be split into various PoS sections, so the clutter is unavoidable.
: ''(they'll still probably be written differently in hieroglyphs)'': in our standard entry layout alternative forms come before what they are alternative to. You can add the Alternative Forms heading just before the PoS heading plus one level.
: ''(keep [[mȝt]])'': I should have used {{temp|alternative spelling of}} instead of {{temp|alternative form of}} (now fixed). The best solution would be to use actual hieroglyph characters (Unicode has them) for the actual entries, and have transliteration stubs linking to it. This is how we deal with Gothic (see [[weihs]]); Gothic also has transliteration issues (hw vs. ƕ). If both ȝ and 3 are widely used, I suggest both have an entry (one of them as an {{temp|alternative spelling of}}).
: I probably won’t be cleaning up Egyptian anymore, because you were [[WT:WL|whitelisted]] yesterday and your edits won’t need to be patrolled anymore. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 14:36, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

== Re ==

I think [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Noah&diff=18415336&oldid=18374557 this] rollback nd the other were in error. i.e. if you check this page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_prophets_of_Abrahamic_religions] these figures are also revered by non-Biblical faiths. [[User:Pass a Method|Pass a Method]] ([[User talk:Pass a Method|talk]]) 07:09, 7 October 2012 (UTC)

:FWIW, I think putting "Abrahamic" or "Abrahamic religions" as a context is wrong, because even non-religious people use the term "Noah" as the name of "an Old Testament character who [is said to have] built an ark". (It's not like non-religious people call him something else.) But {{temp|biblical character}} is like putting {{temp|context|mammal}} in [[[[bear]]]] (something we don't do)... so I think there should be no tag at all, though we may want to raise this issue in a bigger forum. Yes, {{temp|biblical character}} puts entries into [[:Category:en:Biblical characters]], but I think categorisation should be done as it is in [[[[bear]]]] (which is in [[:Category:en:Mammals]] "manually").

: It wasn’t in error. First of all, you used {{temp|sense}} instead of {{temp|context}}. That alone is good enough reason to revert, but if it was just that I’d have fixed it myself. I added the explanation to my undo at [[Solomon]] and reverted the other similar edits, hoping that you’d notice Solomon’s edit summary. Here it is: “ It’s a biblical character. If it also found elsewhere elsewhere append another context template.” You see, your removal of the {{temp|biblical character}} template removed [[Solomon]], [[Noah]], etc. from [[:Category:Biblical characters]], which is just wrong because they ''are'' biblical characters! If you had changed it to {{temp|context|Abrahamic}} (or {{temp|context|Abrahamic religions}}, which I prefer for clarity’s sake) and added [[:Category:Biblical characters]] manually to the entry I wouldn’t have minded. Even better: create a context template for {{temp|Abrahamic religions}}.

(I'm lazy, that's why it's in Latinica.)

== Audiorecordings ==

Hello, I would like to know, how do i upload or record audio recordings for word entries??? {{unsigned|Elperretebueno}}
:Hi. First, you need to record the pronunciation using an external software. I recommend you use Audacity. See [[User:Mikemoral/Audio|this]] for details. If the word is Georgian, name the recorded file ''ka-word.ogg''; for example, the pronunciation file for [[შუბი]] must be named ''ka-შუბი.ogg''. Then upload the file [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&uploadformstyle=basic here]. Finally, you must link to the file from Wiktionary like [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%83%A8%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98&action=historysubmit&diff=13502864&oldid=13502796 this]. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] 07:54, 10 July 2011 (UTC)

== [[Baklahorani]] ==

Hi there Vahag! I was reading about [[Baklahorani]] and bumped into a theory that it was derived from Armenian "pagyal horan". But I couldn't find both words here, it says it means "sheeted, covered mihrab" or something like that. Actually that "mihrab" could be something in a church, lika a mihrab in a mosque, not sure.

:Hi. The source meant {{m|hy|փակյալ||closed, shut}} and {{m|hy|խորան||mihrab-like structure in Armenian churches}}. I found a couple of mentions of a festival called {{m|hy||փակյալ խորան}}, but the references are too few to understand what it's about.

== Several questions ==

Barev Vahagn!

One day I wanted to create a new entry for the Georgian word [[ჩემთვის]](translation: for me), but I dunno what part of speech it is; So, have any ideas? And there're many more words like this. 

Also, why do the declensional templates(e.g. Georgian etc.) have to show transliterations too? If our final goal is to make articles for all words and even inflected forms too, then in the end we will also have transliterations for all words(as this is a part of our goal), and one can easily follow the link within the table of declension. So i'm guessing it is temporary, is it?

And lastly, can you explain what is difference between verb, verbal noun and verb form? or what header should I use when describing a word like this : ვსვამ(vsvam) (I'm drinking), if i tell you that whe just have verbal noun and verbs(I mean words that describe an action, have tense , take object/subject, mood); So, verb form or verb? I guess it isnt verbal noun :D.

And after the last:D, [[წიგნის მაღაზია]] & [[ცხენის ძალა]] they are noun phrases, yeah? Thx--[[User:Dixtosa|88.123.102.25]] 15:24, 19 February 2012 (UTC)

:Privet, Dixtul. 

:I don't know Georgian and I don't know what part of speech [[ჩემთვის]] is. Probably a pronoun.

:Transliterations in declension tables are not temporary. Having the transliterations of inflected forms on one page is very convenient. By looking at them you can learn inflection patterns, without having to click on each form separately.

:"Verb form" is not a part of speech. In Wiktionary we use names like "noun form" or "verb form" to designate ''inflected'' forms, as opposed to [[lemma]] forms, also known as [[citation form]]s. For example, [[კაცი]] is a "noun", [[კაცების]] is a "noun form". Another example, Russian {{m|ru|пить}} is a "verb", {{m|ru|пью}} is a "verb form". The first one should be categorized in [[:Category:Russian verbs]], the second one in [[:Category:Russian verb forms]]; but both should have a ===Verb=== heading. Georgian [[ვსვამ]] is a verb form and should be formatted like [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%83%95%E1%83%A1%E1%83%95%E1%83%90%E1%83%9B&action=historysubmit&diff=16298302&oldid=16278305 this]; ideally it should be defined with reference to its lemma form, which is [[სმა]]. See how Spanish [[bebo#Spanish]] is defined as ''First-person singular (yo) present indicative form of [[beber]]''.

:If you want my advice, don't waste your time on creating verb forms and noun forms. That should be done by bots, someday in the future. You should just create entries for the infinitive of verbs and the singular nominative of nouns.

:I don't know anything about verbal nouns in Georgian to say whether they should be treated as "verbs", "verb forms" or as a separate part of speech.

:As for [[წიგნის მაღაზია]] and [[ცხენის ძალა]], I think they should be defined as nouns. The first one seems to be a sum of parts. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] 17:59, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

::thx. Hm, as the results of my observations suggest, <nowiki>{{</nowiki>LangCode-verb}} is usually used for infinitives and cuz Georgian daznt differ verbal noun and infinitive(in other words, infinitives in Georgian are called verbal nouns), we have to promote verbal noun(thus make template ''ka-verbal noun'') and delete ''ka-verb''(as it gets useless) or promote ''ka-verb'' and stop the practice of making verbal nouns under the ''head|ka|verbal noun'' template. So we have to make desicion. I prefer the first.
::yeah that's purely wasting time, but u know some inflected forms convey meanings other than what is supposed. and that other meanings prompt me to create entry.--[[User:Dixtosa|Wikstosa]] 20:02, 23 February 2012 (UTC)

:::You're the only native Georgian contributor, so if you think it's better to use ''ka-verbal noun'' and delete ''ka-verb'', go for it. I have no opinion. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 22:08, 24 February 2012 (UTC)

== oǰ-type ==

Ok subject line might be a bit misleading, but you know I'm lazy. So I was thinking that at a certain point, when my Armenian is better and my understanding of the underlying grammatical functions is more thorough I'll maybe write some appendices and the notes in the titles of templates like the noun declension templates can link to such appendices, like [[Appendix:Armenian declension/oǰ-type]] or something. I probably won't do in-depth ones for a while, since Wiktionary's been getting on my last nerve recently and the story is taking a lot of my focus, but I think I might do some basic ones like how to compare adjectives and stuff like that. Grammar is so friggin' sexy.

: The other is about an Armenian verbs numerous impersonal forms... the participles and converbs. In Հասնելու եմ, there's a line that says "Լույս թե մութ ճամփաներ ուզածի եմ հասնելու", which I don't quite get despite the fact that I know all the individual words except 'uzac', because I don't know what that participle does.

::Don't know the answer to the phonology question. As for the second, it should be "Լույս թե մութ ճամփաներ, ուզածի'''ս''' եմ հասնելու". It means "bright or dark paths, I will reach what I want". {{m|hy||Ուզած}} is the resultative participle of {{m|hy|ուզել}} and means "that which is wanted". {{m|hy||Ուզածի}} is its genitive/dative case. With the first-person possessive suffix {{m|hy|-ս}} it means "to that which I want".
::The subject participle is easy: 
::{{m|hy|ուզել||to want}} > {{m|hy|ուզող||wanter, wanting person or thing, хотящий}} 
::{{m|hy|նայել||to watch}} > {{m|hy|նայող||looker, looking person or thing, смотрящий}} 
::{{m|hy|վիճել||to dispute}} > {{m|hy|վիճող||disputant}}

Well, {{l|ar|حلاق|tr=ħallāq}} means [[barber]], but I don’t think that’s the word you want. {{l|ar|دلك|tr=dálaka}} means to rub, to stroke, and I think that’s probably the root of your word. However, I don’t know of a form exactly like "dallak". There is {{l|ar|دلوك|tr=dalūk}} which means [[liniment]], and {{l|ar|دلك|tr=dalk}} means [[rubbing]], {{l|ar|تدليك|tr=tadlīk}} is [[massage]], and {{l|ar|مدلك|tr=mudállik}} means [[masseur]]. My guess is that {{l|ar|مدلك|tr=mudállik}} is the word you’re looking for. (It is possible that *{{l|ar|دلاك|tr=dallāk}} exists in some dialect, but I don’t know about it.) [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 23:27, 23 September 2012 (UTC)

|}

Judging from this table, the negative չ can be prefixed to the following finite forms:

* All forms of the auxiliary "եմ"
* All forms of the aorist
* All forms of the subjunctive future 
* All forms of the subjunctive future perfect

According to the table on [[լինել]] it can also be prefixed to the following non-finite forms:

* Infinitive
* Conneg
* Resultative participle
* Subject participle

There are the following prefix groups:

* '''No prefix''': {imperfective, perfective, simultaneous, future I, future II} participle, imperative
* '''չ only''': aorist, infinitive, resultative participle, subject participle, conneg
* '''չ and կ''': subjunctive future, subjunctive future perfect

::<nowiki>:)</nowiki> Ok, great, thanks! Next question... the passive and causative, (a) these are derivations?  e.g. verb + passive gets the whole verbal paradigm after ?

== Verbal inflection ==

From reading the grammar (Modern Eastern Armenian), and the templates [[:Template:hy-conj-ել]], [[:Template:hy-conj-ալ]] and [[:Template:hy-conj-ցն-ել]], could I draw the following conclusions?:

* In order to account for all possibilities of stem changes, a program to conjugate Armenian verbs would need to know about the following stems / irregular forms: 
** Present (e.g. tan-)
** Aorist (e.g. tar-)
** Passive (if the verb is transitive, with a passive) -- (e.g. tarv-)
** Causative (if the verb has a causative) 
** Imperative (e.g. tar!-)
* All the suffixes and prefixes are entirely regular depending on the verb type -el, -al, -c’nel. 

In most cases the passive and causative stems will be regular (in -v- and -cʿn-), but sometimes they will be irregular. 

Are there any irregular suffixes at all ? -- e.g. that depend on a particular stem ? - [[User:Francis Tyers|Francis Tyers]] ([[User talk:Francis Tyers|talk]]) 21:22, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

:For 99.99% of the verbs the program would only need the present stem and the aorist stem. The passive, causative and imperative can be deduced from them. All the suffixes and prefixes are entirely regular for these verbs. The other 0.01% with irregularities are collected in [[:Category:Armenian irregular verbs]]. They have irregularities in the Passive or Causative or Imperative or Aorist. The set of suffixes is different for {{m|hy|գալ}}, {{m|hy|տալ}}, {{m|hy|լալ}}. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 10:53, 3 December 2012 (UTC)

== FWOTD ==

Hi. I'm looking for more words to add to the [[WT:FW|Foreign Word of the Day]], and I was wondering if you could suggest some words in Armenian and Old Armenian. The only requirements are that they need at least one citation (a reference or quotation) and pronunciation each. For example, if you add IPA to [[առածիմ]], we can feature that. I'd like to get words that express ideas that are not used much in English as a single word or that express interesting concepts, but aren't ''too'' rare. If you have anything from other languages you're familiar with, that would be great as well.

Привет,

Ползователь Ruakh создал программку для быстрого создания статей из переводов на русский язык. Работает очень хорошо, я протестировал. Нужно только добавить код (зависит от оболочки, которую ты используешь) в Викисловаре и перезагрузить браузер. Склонение, спряжение, синонимы и прочее нужно добавлять в ручную.

Одним щелчком в переводе на русский слова [[abstinence]]:
<pre>
=={{subst:ru}}==

===Noun===
{{ru-noun|tr=vozderžánije|g=n}}

# [[abstinence]] {{gloss|the act or practice of abstaining}}

</pre>

Остается добавить другие значения (если есть), склонение, и т.д.

<pre>=={{subst:ru}}==</pre> автоматически меняется на '''Russian''' после сохранения.

Этот скрипт сможет работать и с другими языками, только нужно добавить код языка, но не со всеми одинаково. Сообщи, если интересно, помогу установить или свяжись напрямую с Руахом.

Спасибо, что исправил, Вааг ([[татарин]])!

У меня есть вопрос к тебе. Я начал делать шаблоны для глаголов [[User_talk:Stephen_G._Brown#Русские_глаголы]]. Похоже некоторые глаголы слишком нерегулярные по Зализняку. В русском викисловаре где-то 350 шаблонов. Ты думаешь действительно такое количество нужно? Мне кажется, что например 4-ую группу, разбитую на несколько шаблонов, можно соединить (смотри [[Talk:гневить#same_conjugation]]), добавив параметр для первого лица ед. числа. Ты наверное уже думал по поводу шаблонов. Мне интересны твое мнение и совет. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 00:02, 4 March 2013 (UTC)

== Languages with difficult scripts ==

{{movedfrom|Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2014/February}}
I was astonished today to run into the word [[šambaliltu]] for fenugreek in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, which I knew by the Persian word {{m|fa|شنبلیله}} (our entry says it's transliterated shambalile, but I thought it was shambalila). I had no idea the word went all the way back to Akkadian. My first thought was: do we have it in Wiktionary? After looking at [[:Category:Akkadian nouns]], I still don't know.

Cuneiform is a complex script that very few people know how to read, and that most references don't use- but all our categories are arranged in character order with no transliteration shown. If you want to find a given word, you have to either: a) browse through all the entries, one by one; b) type the transliteration into the search box and hope it matches the one in the entry; or c) try to guess the characters in the name from the transliteration using some reference, and look for them in the category.

How can we improve on this? I know we can add a sort key to the category wikilink in each entry to make the categories list in transliteration order, and we can create transliteration-of entries ([[:Category:Akkadian nouns]] has exactly one of those). It would be nice to have an automatically-generated index of transliterations for each category, and/or have the transliterations visible in the category listing itself. The second option looks like it would require assistance from the developers, but what about the first? Does anyone have other ideas?

: On refreshing myself with Cuneiform, it's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#Transliteration a hard problem]. Akkadian cuneiform is a syllabary, but the normalised transcriptions (in Wiktionary, anyway) do not show the syllables which spell the word. (A·KA·AS·SA·PU·TU > Ákassaptu, as a completely made up example. More the point, a symbol may be read as Akkadian, Sumerian (which I think is shown by the differing transcriptions in parenthesis (Akkadian reading) and brackets [SUMERIAN]) or as a determiner. I don't think an automatic transcription is possible, much less fuzzy searching as described above. Moreover, I think that an Assyriologist needs to go through and normalise these, with a better description of what's going on. Something like 
:* '''Akkadian'''
:*: [[𒀀]] (mū) ''f.'' (''plural'')
:*:# water
:*: '''Usage notes'''
:*: Most often complemented with [[MEŠ]] (''link to whatever the cuneiform is for MEŠ'')
: Sumerian readings should be listed in the Translingual section. The Akkadian section would give variant transcriptions, possibly with a link to an appendix describing the process and conventions (such as transcribing in lower case for Akkadian readings, and UPPERCASE for Sumerian readings, which are not uncommonly combined within a word), and possibly even the transcription and the normalisation. The cuneiform would be a lemma, and the normalisation would also be a lemma, each linking to the other, but the diplomatic transcription, while given in both places, would not be a lemma. So...
:* [[𒋠𒍝𒆳𒋛𒀀]] ([[argamannu]] [SÍG.ZA.GÌN.SA5]) is a head line, which would link to 
:* [[𒅈𒂵𒌋𒌋𒉡]] ([[argamannu]] [ar.ga.man.nu]) and both would link to
:* [[argamannu]] which would require two transcriptions: ([[𒋠𒍝𒆳𒋛𒀀]] [SÍG.ZA.GÌN.SA5]) and ([[𒅈𒂵𒌋𒌋𒉡]] [ar.ga.man.nu])
: TL;DR: It's a hard, and probably not automatable, problem to solve properly. --[[User:Catsidhe|Catsidhe]] <sup>([[User talk:Catsidhe|verba]], [[Special:Contributions/Catsidhe|facta]])</sup> 22:29, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

There may be other typographic alternatives that could be eliminated.

:Jut to add my voice to the chorus: obsolete forms should '''not''' go in the headword line. We shouldn't clutter the line with information which is no longer useful and, by giving it prominence, suggest it is still usable*&nbsp;: I've known a couple of Germans who liked to use the 'goest'-forms of verbs because they couldn't stand that English wouldn't use as full a set of verb forms as German; they never realized (much like people who use ligatured spellings of "æqual", and much like the North Korean press office which famously only had outdated English-Korean translation dictionaries for a long time) how affectatious they sounded; we don't need to encourage more people to do the same. The [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/July#Inconsistent_mention_of_inflected_forms|last time the presence of obsolete forms on headword lines was discussed]], people seemed to favour creating conjugation tables for English verbs which would include the -eth and -est forms. (And people seemed to oppose listing obsolete forms on headword lines, so I proceeded to move all the obsolete forms I could find in headword lines down to, for lack of a better place, ====Usage notes====.)<br>*I realize one could say much the same of obsolete alternative forms, which I nevertheless don't support moving out of the ===Alternative forms=== section, despite that section's current prominent placement. I think the solution there is to collapse the obsolete forms under a rel-top, and perhaps move the entire Alt forms section — whereas, collapsing part of a headword line, or moving the headword line to a different part of the entry, would be a bad idea. Also, I think that obsolete forms belong with other alt forms, and can (when in Alt forms sections) be segregated onto a separate line and labelled clearly, whereas obsolete forms listed as part of a single run-on headword line can't be labelled as clearly without making the headword line into two or more lines.<br> [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:43, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

:::The discreet way in which quotations are concealed by default would be great for obsolete etc forms, still allowing common alternative forms to be prominently displayed. That same approach could allow the archaic inflected verb forms to be displayed just beneath the modern inflected forms.

::[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/July#Inconsistent_mention_of_inflected_forms|Discussion last year]] showed that there was interest in having conjugation tables for English verbs, and this discussion shows continued interest, so I've deployed a conjugation table on ''[[walk]]'' and ''[[talk]]'' (adapted from something CodeCat designed in the July 2013 discussion—I made some changes to which forms were displayed). See what you think. Obviously, we'll need another table to account for verbs that add, delete or change letters when inflecting, e.g. ''hate'', but that shouldn't be too hard, and per our usual practice, I expect that all the tables used in entries will end up being shells that use a single backend. I think ''be'' is so much more complex than every other verb (with two whole conjugations, and many forms other verbs don't distinguish) that it may need a separate template, though.

== Updating [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained/POS headers]] ==

This page is very important as far as policy/common practice pages go, but it's also rather out of date. We should bring it up to date, but I'm not sure what the current state of affairs is on everything. I know that there's a general consensus that "acronym", "initialism" and such are no longer acceptable. We've also deprecated "cardinal number/numeral" and "ordinal number/numeral" recently in favour of plain "numeral" (for cardinals that don't fit any other part of speech) as well as "adjective" for ordinals. But there's also "idiom" which I don't think should be allowed either, although I don't know if any consensus exists on that. "Participle" seems to be gaining some ground recently; all Dutch participle entries use it now.

We should probably also go through the "Other headers in use" list and see which ones we should try to track down and fix. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:09, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

:Indeed. If someone more technically adept than me could generate a list of all the POS headers that are currently in use (and, if it wouldn't be too taxing, a count of how often each header is used), that would let us know where we stand, as far as which headers are in use vs which are prescribed by WT:POS. <small>One way to generate a list of POS headers would be to generate a list of L3 headers and then just manually remove non-POS stuff like "See also".</small> In fact, a list of ''all'' L1, L3, L4, L5, etc headers (but not L2 headers — [[WT:STATS]] already has a list of those) which are in use, with information on what level they are and how often they occur, would surely reveal some typos and other things that we'd like to change. There shouldn't be any L1 headers. And I often notice "References" at L4 not inside a numbered etymology section. But I'm getting off-topic; I apologise.

== Wiktionary would benefit from a more user-friendly discussion forum ==

I have not been editing here regularly for years, and so coming back and looking at things with fresh eyes I think that there is a need for a more modern discussion forum, with a more normal way of posting messages. I think that would help discussions to take place more easily and would allow new users and people who don't edit regularly to contribute to discussions without being familiar with the unusual way of posting a message (when compared with other online forums/'fora'). It might be easier to edit from a tablet, as well. Also, the current format is slow to edit for anyone with a very slow internet connection. Does anyone agree? Has this been raised before?

== Part-of-speech sections with multiple headword lines, lemmas with form-of definitions on the same page ==

Occasionally I come across entries where there is a single part-of-speech header with multiple headword lines below it. An example is [[mensa]], in the Latin section. There are also many examples of this in Italian entries. Sometimes they are like the case of [[mensa]] where the second headword line is simply a form of the first, but I've also seen it used to distinguish masculine and feminine-gendered nouns with the same lemma form. I'm wondering what the general consensus is about entries like this. I personally think that this is wrong, and that these really should have their own headers. Masculine and feminine nouns are separate, they are not the same lemma, because they have (at least in Italian) separate types of inflections. But even the Latin ''mēnsā'' is not the same word as ''mēnsa''; they have different pronunciations and it's only because of an orthographic shortcoming that they end up on the same page. There's also a practical consideration: having "floating headwords" with no header before them is harder for bots to parse, especially when they are formatted using the obsolete "bold headword" formatting like ''mēnsā'' is. As the page is now, a bot that tries to parse that page will come upon what seems like a random bit of bold text in the middle of the list of definitions. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:26, 3 March 2014 (UTC)

:''[[mensa|Mensa]]'' should definitely not be formatted like it is, we should either remove the "'''mēnsā''' {{g|f}}" line (and perhaps also the following "# {{inflection of|la|mēnsa||abl|s}}" which simply points users to the page they're on) or give it its own ===Noun=== header. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 00:12, 4 March 2014 (UTC)
:: I don't think we should remove it, because it's pronounced differently from the noun above. There should be two pronunciation sections on the page, which implies two noun sections IMO. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 15:32, 4 March 2014 (UTC)

A question that's somewhat related is about form-of definitions that are homonymous with the lemma and therefore appear on the same page, under the same etymology/pronunciation section (often under the same PoS header too and listed as one of the definitions of the lemma, but not always). ''mēnsā'' is not an example, because its pronunciation differs, but the entry also contains a definition for the vocative singular. Again I'm not really sure if this is good practice. The main reason we create form-of entries in my opinion is to let people find the lemma, and also to give pronunciation information about each form specifically. But when the lemma is on the same entry already, and has the same pronunciation, there's not really anything to be gained from listing the form-of definition there. There would presumably be an inflection table on the entry, and that would show which forms coincide with the lemma form (these often appear in black bold, too). Please note that this doesn't apply at all to ''sublemma'' form entries. These entries would need extra grammatical information, such as their own inflection table. In those cases we should create sections for both, like on {{m|nl|vergeten}}, which is both a verb (infinitive lemma) and the past participle of that verb. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:26, 3 March 2014 (UTC)

== Hot words ==

Lately there has been a lot of debate about words such as [[olinguito]] and [[Euromaidan]], which don't pass CFI but likely will in the future. I think that instead of keeping them outside of CFI, we should amend CFI to accommodate such words.

Proposal for special provisions for "hot words":
* If a word that can be considered beneficial to Wiktionary has citations that do not span the required time period, but meet the following criteria, the word may be kept as a "hot word". The citations must be:
** relatively recent.
** reach a wide population.
** from a wide variety of media.
* An entry for a "hot word" will have a highly visible indication of its special status.
* While a "hot word" meets the above criteria, it will have the same rights as any other entry and may even be featured on the main page.
* A "hot word" will be reevaluated every time its lifespan doubles and if it does not still meet the above criteria, it must be deleted.

== Plural forms of proper nouns ==

Many proper nouns have well-attested plural forms; for example, ''[[Frances]]'', ''[[Germanies]]'', ''[[Caitlins]]'' and ''[[Jesuses]]''. It seems to me that we could create a couple of templatised usage notes which would explain two major categories of proper noun plurals, namely: 
# The plurals of personal names, which are used to refer to multiple individuals with the same name, and perhaps sometimes in the same way as placename-plurals (q.v.), as in "the two Obamas [the college-age one with X political views and the sitting president with Y political views] might not even recognise each other". And: 
# The plurals of placenames, which are used when comparing or contrasting two historical incarnations, or two current or historical governments or social incarnations, of a place, e.g. "the border between the two Germanies", "unite the two Jerusalems", "John Edwards assailed the divide between the two Americas".
Some plurals would need more explanation than the template alone would provide — there is slightly more to say about the use of ''Germanies'' than about ''Frances''/''Estonias''/''Denmarks'', and more to say about the use of ''Jesuses'' than about ''Caitlins''/''Barbaras''/''Annas''/etc — but additional information could easily be provided along with or even in place of the templatised usage note. </br>What do you think? Would it be a good idea to have such usage notes? Where should they be placed: in ''France''/''Anna'' etc, in ''Frances''/''Annas'' etc, or in both places? What should the titles of the templates that contain the notes be? [[Template:U:Latin stop+liquid poetic stress alteration|Some templatised usage notes]] exist in a "U:" 'subnamespace' like the "R:" one that our reference templates exist in; [[Template:ff-common-note|others are named in other ways]]. (Many languages use the plurals of personal and place names the same way English does, so it would seem inappropriate to use a language prefix.)

In 2012 and 2013, the ISO retired several codes by merging them into other codes or splitting them up. Thirty of these retirements appear to have escaped our notice. I posted [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2014/February#Codes_the_ISO_has_split_or_merged_.28first_batch.29 one batch here]]; here is the second batch, plus my thoughts on them; I'll post the rest another day.

(The ISO records this in a somewhat unclear way, but see [http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2012-096 here].) I propose we do likewise. Note that some literature takes the opposite stance and considers Luhu to be a dialect of Piru, but the end result for us — that we have a language with <tt>{"Luhu", "Piru"}</tt> as its <tt>names</tt> field — is the same.

== [[Appendix:Orphaned words]] is neglected ==

[[Appendix:Orphaned words]] could use some TLC. Half the information is in hidden comments in the source of the page. The term "Orphaned word" seems not to be used elsewhere, and perhaps it should be called [[w:Unpaired word|unpaired words]] or "[[w:Cranberry morpheme|cranberry morphemes]]" or "[[w:Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized terms]]" as it seems to contain all of the above. If it weren't just seven words long I'd suggest creating an appendix for each of the above. In order to clear up confusion and stop them being added again, false examples should be listed as such, rather than be deleted (e.g. where the apparent etymology is different to the actual, or where compounding happened in another language). The centered table format seems out of place on Wiktionary. And the list seems like it could be much longer.

Anyone want to have a go at adding terms to it, renaming it, reformatting it, splitting it up, turning it into a category (or categories), merging with the list on Wikipedia's [[w:Unpaired word|Unpaired word]] page, or generally just cleaning it up?

== Links to Wikipedia in reference templates ==

Hello all. [[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] and I are currently in disagreement about whether to link to Wikipedia from reference templates (the ones that start with <tt>R:…</tt>). Take {{temp|R:L&S}} as an example: I prefer [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AR%3AL%26S&diff=25801969&oldid=25800450 this version], whereas Dan Polansky prefers [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template:R:L%26S&diff=next&oldid=25801969 this version]. There are other differences between those two diffs, but the salient bone of contention is whether or not to link to [[w:A Latin Dictionary]] in the template code.

I assert that reference templates should link to the relevant cited authority's Wikipedia article; that way, an explanation for ''why'' the source is being cited as an ''authority'' is readily available for the sceptical reader on the other side of the link. Dan Polansky maintains that such links are distracting and inessential; the latter because a reader can copy the name of the reference work and paste it to Wikipedia article box thereby finding the relevant article.

You can see the (short) discussion so far at [[User talk:Dan Polansky#Re linking in reference templates]]. As far as I can tell, [[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] and I support such linking (''i.e.'', single links to the cited authority's Wikipedia article ''only''), whereas Dan Polansky opposes such linking. I come here to try to obtain consensus for such linking. What do others think? — [[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 19:39, 9 March 2014 (UTC)

P.S.: {{ping|Atelaes|Dan Polansky}} I have tried to represent your views faithfully; please post corrections hereto if you feel I have misrepresented either of your positions.

: I have no general opposition to linking, but linking to the Wikipedia article about a dictionary is not very useful. If it were a citation of a novel or something, that would be a different story and I would support linking, but I'm not sure what exactly the difference is. So I'm undecided. (Having said that, I definitely oppose [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template:R:L%26S&diff=25768544&oldid=23471797 this version]). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:13, 9 March 2014 (UTC)
:Support linking to WP or the home page of the reference website, if it is online and WP doesn't have any article. I try to do this routinely. 
:We have a number of templates that contain two links, one to a webpage that has substantive information relevant to the headword and one to some page that explains the source in some way, either at WP or a source site page such as its home page or "About us". Having two links increases the possibility for confusion. We seem to have all possible kinds of user preferences and behavior with respect to such links in unknown proportions: not being able to find and follow blue links even when they would help, finding them distracting/following them accidentally, hitting the source-site link rather than the content page link, as well as figuring out which link is relevant to one's needs and using it appropriately. 
:This discussion makes me wonder whether we should reduce the size of the source link by not having the entire site title be clickable. That would seem to reduce the likelihood of following the source-explanation link when one wanted the content link. I don't see why cut-and-paste should be required for a user to satisfy a question about the source of some information, especially if there is a WP article on the source, as there often is in my experience.

::It follows ''a fortiori'' from the argument about confusion where there are two links that I agree with Wikitiki that the version of the L&S template he cites, with its multiple links, is unsatisfactory, as it provides even more opportunities for mistakenly following links of minimal relevance to identifying and evaluating the source of the substantive information.

* '''Oppose''' linking to a Wikipedia article from the reference work name. The reference template should focus the follow-link behavior on the sole link, which takes the reader directly to the page where they can find more about the word, rather than the reference work.

References on the page should follow the same format as references for quotations, as much as possible.

If we format references consistently, then it is less confusing to link to Wikipedia articles for titles or authors (I’d suggest limiting this to one link, to the author only if there is no article about the work). Why not use the visible shortcut to show the nature of the interwiki link?:

:I certainly oppose [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template:R:L%26S&diff=25768544&oldid=23471797 this much] linking. I tend to oppose other linking (e.g. linking of author names and work titles) in reference templates, too, because users may click on the work-title links expecting to get to the cited page in the reference, and then have to backtrack. (On File pages that say "This is a file from the [[:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. Information from its [[:File:Cat03.jpg|description page there]] is shown below.", I have on an embarrassingly large number of occasions been distracted enough to click on the "[[:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]" link and then have to backtrack and click the link to the actual file.) Linking author and/or work names when quoting a book under a sense, the way {{w|Thomas Jefferson}} is linked in [[[[liberticide]]]], is more acceptable, because I think users are less likely to click the links expecting to get to the citation, since they can already see the citation (quoted on the very next line).

I take on board the general opposition to overuse of wikilinking; I apologise, for I hadn't realised how distracting and potentially confusing others find it, because I don't myself find such linking particularly distracting nor at all confusing. ''Re'' the proposed alternatives to [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AR%3AL%26S&diff=25801969&oldid=25800450 this version]:
* {{reply to|DCDuring|p=}} ("reduc[ing] the size of the source link by not having the entire site title be clickable" and the Rhipidistia/Palaeos format proposed above in your post timestamped: 22:38, 13 March 2014): Unfortunately, I think that your format would be ''more'' likely to cause users to follow the incorrect link (or at least, I believe it would if most users are anything like me). I say that because, when I see a blue link with either <font color="blue"><big>□</big><span style="margin-left:-1.2ex;">⇗</span></font> or a padlock (or whatever) beside it, I correctly interpret it to be an external link, whereas when I see a simple blue link, I interpret that as an internal (''i.e.'', intra-Wikimedia) link (with dark blue for Wiktionary links and light blue for links to other MW projects); that, I expect, is what the software's developers intended. Although there are some links to sources that point to Wikisou rce, most source links on the English Wiktionary are external links (usually to Google Books or Usenet). The fact about sourcing here and the software developers' intent interact in the mind to produce in me (and, I assume, in others) the assumption that a link with <font color="blue"><big>□</big><span style="margin-left:-1.2ex;">⇗</span></font> or a padlock (or whatever) beside it is the source of whatever I'm looking at/for. (And it seems as if that assumption is also behind the recommended use of {{temp|usex}}'s <tt>ref=</tt> parameter.) For me, the format you give would temporarily confuse me, until I'd hovered over the links to guess by their URLs the content of what they're pointing to. (''Pace'' {{ping|-sche|p=,}} your confusion-causing example concerns two plain blue, internal links, and not one internal link with one external link; I suspect you would be far less likely to make the same mistake were you to be faced with the latter combination.)

* {{reply to|Dan Polansky|p=}} ("I…oppose the extraneous 'New York: Harper & Brothers' added"): Come to think of it, it seems pretty unnecessary to mention the publisher at all; what do you say we remove the "Oxford: Clarendon Press" bit, too?
* {{reply to|Mzajac|p=}} ("format[ting] references consistently" and "Why not use the visible shortcut to show the nature of the interwiki link?"): I agree with you regarding what I take to be your point about consistent formatting of references: that they should conform, as closely as analogously appropriate, to the standard format(s) laid out in [[WT:"]], yes? If that is indeed what you mean, why did you put the publication date immediately after the authors' names? For consistency with WT:", the date should be included in parentheses immediately after the publisher's name (see the citation from ''{{w|Treasure Island}}'' under [[WT:"#Between the definitions]]). As for including the ISBNs, they automatically create blue links, which many in this discussion have opposed, and they are of very marginal usefulness; I suggest we not include them for those reasons. I confess that I dislike "''[[w: A Latin Dictionary]]''", although largely on aesthetic grounds; would something like "<sup>w:</sup>''{{w|A Latin Dictionary}}''" be acceptable?
In the light of the discussion so far, I suggest one of the two following formats for, ''e.g.'', {{temp|R:L&S|2=via|3=via}}:

:''Previous discussions: [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2008/March#Norwegian_language_classification|March 2008]], [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour/2008/July#Norwegian_.E2.80.93_again|July 2008]], [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour_archive/2011/February#Norwegian_headings|February 2011]], [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/January#Norwegian_Bokm.C3.A5l.2FNynorsk|January 2012]], [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/August#Problem:_Norwegian_dialectal_entries|August 2012]].''
:''On March 20th, [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-03/Unified Norwegian]] will begin so that we can (hopefully) formalize a policy on this oft-discussed subject.''

At present, we treat all three of "Norwegian" (code ''no''), "Norwegian Bokmål" (''nb'') and "Norwegian Nynorsk" (''nn'') as languages. We have 5800 ==Norwegian== entries, 4800 ==Norwegian Bokmål== entries and 7400 ==Norwegian Nynorsk== entries. I and [[WT:RFM#Category:Translation_requests_.28Norwegian.29|several others]] think we should stop treating Bokmål and Nynorsk as languages separate from Norwegian. <br>As was pointed out in a previous discussion, Nynorsk and Bokmål are two standards of Norwegian, but there are other standards (e.g. Riksmål) and many dialects whose words, because they cannot be labelled Bokmål or Nynorsk, would ironically be the sole users of the plain ==Norwegian== header if we were ever to seriously consider Nynorsk and Bokmål separate languages (but in fact most of the words which currently use the ==Norwegian== header are acceptable in both, or sometimes just one, of the standards). <br>Bokmål and Nynorsk are mutually intelligible <small>(see e.g. Rubén Chacón-Beltrán's ''Introduction to Sociolinguistics'', page 135, and Joshua Fishman and Ofelia Garcia's ''Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity'', page 434)</small>. They are no more different than US English and Indian English or txtspk or any of the other forms of English we handle very well with context tags rather than separate L2 headers. <br>In a previous discussion, someone (I don't recall who) made the point that there also exists a degree of mutual intelligibility between Norwegian and Danish. The person who made this point seemed to think it constituted an argument against merging Nynorsk and Bokmål. I dismiss this slippery slope fallacy. If anyone wants to propose merging Norwegian and Danish, they can start a section about that below this one, and the merits of it can be discussed, but the question I ask in this section is: "should we stop treating ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk== as languages separate from ==Norwegian==?"

::For what it's worth, we've already had this discussion, [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour/2008/March#Norwegian_language_classification|here]], among other places.  I strongly suggest people interested in the topic read some.

: Bokmål and Nynorsk are different enough to be considered separate languages, because they are also different enough from Swedish and Danish. It's true that Nynorsk is skewed more towards the west of Norway while Bokmål is closer to the urban speech of the east, but that's only kind of relevant, because in reality both standards claim to be written representations of the full range of speech in all of Norway. That is, the aim of both is to be a single unified language for all Norwegians, not merely to represent some part of them. So even if they have a different dialectal base, they are not regional dialects of Norwegian; they're both Norwegian, period. That means IMO that they can't be treated as true languages; languages have phonology, and pronunciation, but Bokmål and Nynorsk don't have anything to do with speech. That in itself must mean that they are not languages, because they are ''written standards only''. The situation is really more like that between ekavian and ijekavian Serbo-Croatian, where one is free to choose whichever. And similar also to Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, or between Latin and Cyrillic Serbian, where different speakers within the same region might decide to use different forms depending on their preference.
: Some Norwegians do claim to "speak Bokmål" or "speak Nynorsk", but what really happens there, as far as I know, is that people simply follow the vocabulary and idioms that are part of one standard or the other. The standards are fairly strict in that regard, they also tell you which words to use! But that could be considered a spelling pronunciation, and I doubt that people do this in everyday life; they'll just speak the local dialect without regard to the Bokmål-Nynorsk division. That of course shows the reality of the situation: as far as everyday speech goes, there's really no such thing as Bokmål or Nynorsk, but there's no "Norwegian" either. There's just varieties as spoken in Norway. Plenty of people will use words that are proscribed by (not included/sanctioned in) either standard. When reading Bokmål out loud, their pronunciation might actually be closer to the Nynorsk spelling, or it might match neither one closely.
: So really, when we split these into separate languages, we end up with the confusing situation in which both language forms always have the same range of dialectal pronunciations and must therefore have '''duplicated, identical pronunciation sections'''. The split also leaves out any forms that are part of neither standard, which Wiktionary must include as part of its NPOV policy. We can't simply decide that all Norwegians must speak either Bokmål or Nynorsk, and whatever doesn't fit those can't be included. I think that implies that we ''must'' by necessity have a language header to account for forms found in neither standard. So that really gives us only two possible ways to handle the situation:
:* Three headers: Bokmål, Nynorsk, and a third language header for whatever words are left out of either one. This would create duplication of all pronunciation information.
:* One header: Norwegian, which encompasses both standards, as well as anything that falls outside them.

* Expanding on my earlier comment: Nynorsk and Bokmål are two of the prescriptivist written standards of Norwegian; they include many, but far from all, Norwegian terms and spellings. Some Norwegian words and spellings fell out of use before Nynorsk and Bokmål came into existence, others are not accepted by either standard but are still used (e.g. in dialects), and others are prescribed by other standards, e.g. Riksmål, the standard used by Norway's largest newspaper, {{w|Aftenposten}}. Our descriptivism and NPOV require that we include all these words. <br>If we consider Norwegian to be a language, this is simple to do: we include all the words under a Norwegian header, and use whatever context tags are appropriate: {{temp|cx|dialectal}}, {{temp|cx|Nynorsk}}, {{temp|cx|obsolete}}/{{temp|obsolete spelling of}}, {{temp|cx|Bokmål}}, {{temp|cx|Riksmål}}, etc. <br>If, on the other hand, we consider Nynorsk and Bokmål to be separate languages, things get harder: <br>- Whenever a term or sense is attested, but we cannot determine if it is acceptable in Nynorsk or Bokmål, we must have a ==Norwegian== section. Readers may expect the ==Norwegian== section to document all the uses the term has in Norwegian, but it may document only the term's obsolete or nonstandard uses. <br>- In the many cases that a term/spelling is used in both Nynorsk and Bokmål, we must duplicate content in a ==Norwegian Nynorsk== section and a ==Norwegian Bokmål== section on the same page. If the spelling is also used in Riksmål, we must document this as well... apparently by having a third section on the page, namely a ==Norwegian== section with a {{temp|cx|Riksmål}} tag. <br>- '''If the prescriptivist body which regulates Nynorsk (or Bokmål) deprecates a particular term or spelling, or newly allows a previously unacceptable term or spelling, we must change the language we consider the term to be''' based on the prescriptivist body's decree. We cannot determine the language of a term we encounter in the wild without referring to the prescriptivist body which governs that "language". '''This is fundamentally incompatible with our descriptivism and policy of NPOV.''' We would never strip the ==French== header off an attested French word or spelling just because the French Academy deprecated it.

*: PS, in previous threads it was noted that the ISO has granted Nynorsk and Bokmål their own codes: the ISO has also granted codes to [[WT:LANGTREAT|many other lects which are not independent languages, listed here]], and to at least one "language" that doesn't even exist, [[Wiktionary:Language treatment/Discussions#Excluding_vmf|vmf]]/"Mainfränkisch".

::* Is it necessarily true that Nynorsk and Bokmål are, by definition, prescriptive standards? I mean, there exist real works that are written using those standards; is it necessarily true that, no matter how many Nynorsk or Bokmål works a word appears in, it's only actually "Nynorsk" or "Bokmål" if the Norwegian Language Council endorses it as such? (I've heard people make similar claims about other languages — e.g., saying something is "not French" if it's not Academically recognized — and usually we're quite happy to ignore such prescriptivist poppycock. What about Nynorsk and Bokmål will forcibly compel us to heed the Council?) —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:35, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

:::* We agree that we should not not strip the ==French== header off an attested French spelling just because the {{w|Académie française|Académie}} does not accept it. If, however, we decide to have a marker (say, a header or a tag like {{temp|cx|Académician French}}) indicating a spelling's presence in the Académie's standard, we should not apply it to spellings the Académie does not accept. Such spellings should have only the basic header (==French==) and not an {{temp|cx|Académician French}} tag. Right?
:::* In my view, our ==Norwegian== header corresponds to that scenario's ==French==, and we have headers for two specific standards (namely ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk==) that correspond to {{temp|cx|Académician French}}. As with French spellings, I think Norwegian spellings which are not in the Bokmål and Nynorsk standards should have only the basic header (==Norwegian==), not Bokmål or Nynorsk tags or headers.
:::* Just as the appearance of a particular word/spelling (say, *''défoobaristiqué'') in French books which otherwise use Académie-approved spellings does not override the Académie's rejection of ''défoobaristiqué'' and make it Académician French, the appearence of a word/spelling (*''enfoobarig'') in books which otherwise use Nynorsk-approved spellings does not, in my view, make ''enfoobarig'' Nynorsk.
:::* Now, one might take a different view, and think ==Norwegian Bokmål== and ==Norwegian Nynorsk== are more like {{temp|cx|US}} and {{temp|cx|UK}}, i.e. dialects, than written standards. Under such a view, it would be more intelligible to see a word's presence in a "Nynorsk work" as indicating it to be Nynorsk. However, (1) CodeCat does a good job of explaining why Nynorsk and Bokmål "are written standards only", not true languages (or, I would add, true dialects). And (2) one would still have to refer to the prescriptive body's list of which words are Nynorsk—or how else would one determine whether the ''other'' spellings in the work were Nynorsk or Bokmål, in order to infer whether the work, and thus ''enfoobarig'', was in Nynorsk or Bokmål?
:::* (And so, because we're using L2 headers to do what should be done with context tags, [in my view] we reach the unusual position of having to change a term's L2 header based on a prescriptivist body's rulings. Changing a ''context tag'' based on prescriptivists' rulings is, in contrast, fairly common: if, for example, authorities proscribe a term, and we notice, we often add a {{temp|cx|proscribed}} or {{temp|cx|sometimes|proscribed}} tag and (on our best days) explanatory usage notes.)

::::* I guess I'm just missing the step from "this is a written standard" to "this is wholly owned and operated by a standards body". I mean, U.S. English also has a written standard, distinct from any spoken dialect, but no single entity defines that standard, and we don't find ourselves preternaturally incapable of identifying works written in it. (My point being — if you're correct that Bokmål and Nynorsk are really nothing but prescriptivist figments, and not language varieties that people actually write in, then not only should they not be language headers, but they ''probably'' shouldn't even be context tags.) —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 00:24, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

* '''support'''. I was just notified of this discussion by [[User:-sche|- -sche]]. My native language is Norwegian (Bokmål {{smiley}}) and I speak a few other languages. I must say that my personal view is that these two languages ideally should be treated as one. But that is a practical view on it. As most contributors have pointed out, the differences between the two are small.  I definitely support the use of {{temp|cx|Nynorsk}} and {{temp|cx|Bokmål}} tags. If you drop that altogether, you would definitely make a mess and create a lot of confusion.

: However, this is quite intricate. One would ideally also need a {{temp|cx|Riksmål}} and a {{temp|cx|Nonstandard}} tag. Riksmål is really a subset of Bokmål. And you also need a tag that allows all the permutations of Bokmål, Nynorsk and Riksmål. I.e. (N/B/R), (N/B), (B/R) and theoretically also (N/R). You also need a tag to point out if a word lacks adequate information, In fact, that is how we have decided to do things on the Norwegian project, if not for an altogether different reason. The number of active contributors on either project is small, so instead of duplicating our effort we decided to join forces. 

: The general sense here in Norway, however, is to keep the two languages apart. The topic is politically quite sensitive, and there are plenty of zealots on either side. Had there been more active users on the Norwegian project I am sure we would have kept the two languages as separate projects. The grammar in the two subsets of the same languages vary quite a lot and there are lots and lots of words that are spelled differently. It is a very time consuming effort to create grammar templates that cater for all needs.

: So, to sum it up, I think it is too easy to dismiss the two as one language. However, for practical reasons I think they should be treated as on non-Norwegian projects. I sincerely hope other Norwegian native speakers will also have their say. I don’t want to be the sole voice of the ones who actually speak this language.

:* <i>Might I also take this opportunity to ask for help on the Norwegian project itself? We are simply too few active contributors to progress in a speedy fashion. We need help with some of the features that bigger projects have implemented long ago. E.g. making translation templates that helps a non-proficient user to quickly add a translation and to add that translated word in the Norwegian project itself. And helping out with programming some smart features like words lacking important sections like a grammar section, etc. I love some of the gadgets I have seen elsewhere but lack the skill to implement them. </i> --[[User:Teodor605|Teodor]] ([[User_talk:Teodor605|d]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/Teodor605|c]]) 00:18, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
* Note: The fact that the two things are '''mutually intelligible''' is far from sufficient for them to be the same language; Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible. The claim that they are one language needs a better support. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:09, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
** I already gave this support. Czech and Slovak represent distinct dialect bases and nobody would claim that either one could cover the whole Czech-Slovak continuum. But with Bokmål and Nynorsk, there is no such geographical "tie": they are both used scattered throughout Norway. It would be as if written Czech and Slovak were both used in both countries, and each person would be free to choose which one, regardless of what dialect they actually spoke, and we'd call them "Knižný Jazyk" and "Nový Československý". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:20, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep separate'''. Although a lot of words are the same in Bokmål and Nynorsk, as well as Danish and Swedish, there are differences in the inflections between the two languages, especially the plural inflections; only in very few cases are the inflections for nouns completely the same, such as for [[snømann]], or mass nouns. In some cases the noun gender can differ; a feminine noun in Nynorsk is usually both masculine and feminine in Bokmål, probably a compromise between Riksmål, which doesn't have a feminine gender, and Nynorsk.<br>I have gradually been eliminating the Tbot entries, determining whether each one is Bokmål, Nynorsk, or both. Any new entries I make are split between the two languages where appropriate. It should also be pointed out that there are separate Wiktionaries for Bokmål and Nynorsk, so why should the English Wiktionary differ from this? There are also separate Wikipedias for both languages. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 19:50, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
*: There is no problem at all in having separate inflection tables for different standards, nor for having different genders for different standards.

*: [edit conflict] I don't understand why separate inflections is an argument for keeping them separate. Look at the inflection tables for Catalan verbs on the Catalan Wiktionary for example ([[:ca:cantar]]). They contain quite a few different alternative forms, depending on dialect; some are part of a standard (Catalan has multiple standards, like Norwegian), some are not. Our current inflection tables don't cover all of these standards, but they probably should at some point. That is not a reason to separate Catalan into multiple languages of course, so it can't be a reason to do that for Norwegian either. All it means is that we need to include more than one inflection table in some Norwegian entries, but that's hardly a problem. As for gender, I don't see how that's a problem either. Norwegian is not the only language where nouns may have ambiguous gender; Dutch is another example, and there are more. We haven't had any trouble with handling those cases, so again we wouldn't expect trouble in this case. Furthermore, you haven't addressed any of the issues that arise from keeping the languages separate (like the question of nonstandard forms), which are far more disruptive. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:03, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*: Re separate wikis: There are also separate Serbian and Croatian Wiktionaries and Wikipedias, yet en.Wikt found it best to have one Serbo-Croatian language rather than several. Re different inflections: English and German also have words which inflect differently, or (in the case of German) have different gender, in different varieties of the language. ''[[Joghurt#German]]'', with its multiple genders and inflection tables, shows how this can be handled. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:06, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*:: It is both true and false that there is both a Bokmål and a Nynorsk Wiktionary, as [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] claims. The ''nn'' project is dead. Check the number of non-bot contributions over the last three years... There was a vote, in 2008 or 2009 I think, to merge them, and all of the ''nn'' content was merge into the ''no'' project. But that was because there weren't enough active users, especially on the Nynorsk project. I wasn't contributing much at that time so I didn't take part in the discusion. The ''no'' project now uses tags to mark ''nb'', ''nn'', ''Riksmål'', and also ''non-standard''. I agree with [[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] when he says there are no dictionaries that treat Nynorsk and Bokmål as one language. If we have the resources to keep them separated I support his view. However, I fear that will just lead to poorer quality, especially when it comes to Nynorsk. The number of active users of Nynorsk is steadily declining, and even in the Norwegian project itself it is hard to find contributors willing to put in the necessary time to check grammar, make grammar templates accomodate Nynorsk inflections etc. Is it very likely that the English project would fare any better? --[[User:Teodor605|Teodor]] ([[User_talk:Teodor605|d]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/Teodor605|c]]) 20:32, 16 March 2014 (UTC) 
* '''Strong oppose''' It would be hypocritical to merge the two versions of Norwegian while keeping the while keeping Danish, Norwegian (Bokmål + Nynorsk) and Swedish separate (because that merger is not likely to happen in the near future, is it? Being pragmatic here). I have yet to encounter a dictionary that treats Bokmål and Nynorsk as the same language, just as I have yet to encounter a dictionary that treats Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as one language (even though they are; check [[User:Njardarlogar/nn-nb-sv-da-vocab|this list]] to get an idea).
: We don't have separate headers for e.g. British English and American English because they are hardly ever treated as separate languages (there is no good reason for that they should be, either). British and American English have the same origin; they share a common core. Nynorsk and Bokmål do not. Bokmål evolved gradually from Danish, while Nynorsk was created from scratch based on rural Norwegian dialects; so the two standards are not as related as one could initially be led to believe (think of [[w:Convergent evolution|convergent evolution]] in biology). Again, please take a look at the [[User:Njardarlogar/nn-nb-sv-da-vocab|list I just linked to]] to get an idea of what we are dealing with. It is in no way such that Bokmål + Nynorsk = Norwegian while Danish and Swedish are entirely different beasts; and the list will give you a strong indication of this. --[[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 23:28, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
:: That still doesn't change the fact that Bokmål and Nynorsk are both standards intended to be used by speakers of all dialects in Norway. That makes them fundamentally different from Danish vs Swedish vs Norwegian. The Swedish standard language is only intended to be used by self-declared Swedish speakers in Sweden, not by Norwegian speakers in Norway. Thus, even though there are quite some differences between Bokmål and Nynorsk, the basic fact is still that they are ''both used in all of Norway'', and there is therefore no strong correlation between location and the standard used. Two neighbours speaking the same local dialect in Trondheim might write in Bokmål and Nynorsk respectively. That, to me, makes all other arguments about their supposed differences, and comparisons with other Scandinavian dialects, irrelevant. They are two standards for the ''same set of dialects''; i.e. those spoken in Norway. Those dialects should therefore be grouped together as "Norwegian".
:: Aside from that, you have not addressed any of the problems that having three (or more!) headers for each separate standard creates. Just read through this discussion and you'll get an idea. I and others have already argued that having just 2 headers is untenable with respect to NPOV, and 3 or more headers creates far more problems than it solves. No matter how many standards we treat as separate languages, we still eventually end up having to need one extra language name to cover anything that's not part of any standard. The practice of treating language standards as normative for what can or cannot be included in Wiktionary under a particular header also goes completely against all practice in this area so far. The names "Bokmål" and "Nynorsk" are by definition prescriptive. So unless you provide solutions for the problems noted in this discussion, your oppose vote really does not accomplish anything. It basically becomes "yes, we have problems, but what about my principles!". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:47, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

::: I agree that having three headers is a rather horrible solution that could create a bad precedent in terms of headers cluttering up the pages. At the same time, there already are thousands of living languages on this planet, so a header or two extra doesn't move us into a new league when it comes to number of headers.
::: I don't see why we should have more than 3 headers. There are only 3 separate codes for the Norwegian language, and there are only 2 normally recognised standards of Norwegian, namely Bokmål and Nynorsk. There are two more variants of written Norwegian, and those are Riksmål and Høgnorsk. Riksmål is ''technically'' a subset of Bokmål (plus perhaps a few extra words/spelling variants that are hardly ever found in contemporary Norwegian texts. Also, see which [http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=93161&rom=MP language] the Riksmål Dictionary is described as being written in in one of the biggest online Norwegian bookstores..). Høgnorsk is very uncommon, and is not a standard. Riksmål can be treated under the Bokmål header while Høgnorsk can be treated under the Nynorsk header.
::: Yes, we'd solve a problem with two headers. But we'd create new problems with the tags. How exactly would that work? Should every Norwegian meaning be tagged so that the reader is never in doubt whether the editor simply forgot to add the tag or is not familiar enough with Bokmål and Nynorsk to know that this meaning or word is only found in one of the two standards? And what about words that are considered [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=nos&begge=+&ordbok=nynorsk dialectal in one standard and ordinary in another?] (Bokmål 2 vs Nynorsk 1; [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=hin&begge=+&ordbok=begge hin is another example, 2 vs 1]). Then there's Riksmål and Høgnorsk again. Should one expect an editor to be sufficiently familiar with these two minority variants in order to tag all entries correctly? Should only Riksmål and Høgnorsk words/spellings that are different from Nynorsk and Bokmål be tagged; or would we have to tag all words that can be said to be Riksmål and Høgnorsk?
::: How relevant is it ''really'' that Nynorsk and Bokmål are aimed at Norwegians and not Danes and Swedes? It doesn't sound very descriptive to mention this as an argument. I could write in Swedish and my fellow Norwegians wouldn't have any major issues with understanding what I wrote. Likewise with Danish. Danish used to be the official (de facto or otherwise) language in Norway for centuries, anyway, so it's not a completely theoretical objection. On board Norwegian airliners, if the captain is Danish or Swedish, the captain will give information first in his native Scandinavian variant, then in English. Just like Norwegian pilots give information first in Norwegian, then in English.
::: Then there's also the important fact that despite that both Bokmål and Nynorsk are supposed to be used by all speakers of all Norwegian dialects, they still have very different origins. Bokmål stems from Danish, while Nynorsk stems from rural Norwegian dialects. So by the argument you are providing, if suddenly one day Swedish started to be popular as a written language in Norway, and some proponents of it meant that all Norwegians should write it, then suddenly Swedish is Norwegian; which ''linguistically'' is nonsense.
::: As for being prescriptive; you have to realise that there is no Norwegian language. There is a Mainland Scandinavian language with 4 official written standards: Bokmål, Danish, Nynorsk and Swedish. It's no more prescriptive to label a word as either Bokmål or Nynorsk than it is to label it as Swedish or Danish. 
::: '''-sche''' writes ''We cannot determine the language of a term we encounter in the wild without referring to the prescriptivist body which governs that "language". This is fundamentally incompatible with our descriptivism and policy of NPOV.'' And indeed, this goes for all of Scandinavian, not just Bokmål vs Nynorsk. --[[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 09:51, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
* At least Njardarlogar knows what he is talking about, being a native Norwegian. There are two ''officially'' recognised languages - Bokmål and Nynorsk; Riksmål isn't, and I don't know anything about Høgnorsk. Although a lot of words are similar, and believe it or not an egg is et egg (Bokmål) or eit egg (Nynorsk), there are also many words which differ fundamentally; compare '''[[ukrainer]]''' with '''[[ukrainar]]''', '''[[eier]]''' with '''[[eigar]]''', and '''[[kirke]]''' with '''[[kyrkje]]''', to quote just a few. I suggest comparing a Nynorsk text with one in Bokmål (Wikipedia is a good source), it is quite obvious that the two languages are sufficiently different to be classed as languages in their own right.
I have been slowly sorting out the mess that exists at present, splitting between Bokmål and Nynorsk where possible, entering missing inflections, replacing inflection tables where they are incomplete or erroneous - I am less than enamoured with inflection tables anyway and prefer a more "in your face" presentation of inflections. But it's a slow job, and I have only tackled nouns so far. But my ideal would be to scrap the "Norwegian" (no) heading entirely, leaving us with just Bokmål and Nynorsk. I would hate to see the work I have done so far undone by a whim. It would be very disheartening, and could lead to my ceasing to contribute.

Cyrillic-script Serbo-Croatian entries have Cyrillic-script usexes, Latin-script entries have Latin-script usexes, don't they? English spellings like ''[[grey]]'' have quotations and usexes that use ''grey'', while spellings like ''gray'' have quotations and usexes that usex ''gray''. Sometimes ''lemma'' entries have quotations from ''all'' forms of a word, e.g. ''[[wight]]'' includes a quotation that actually uses the obsolete spelling ''wyght'', but users have said in past discussions that they felt that was good because the lemma should represent all the forms. In any case, I don't see how or why our treatment of Norwegian usexes under one ==Norwegian== header would or should differ from our treatment of Serbo-Croatian or English usexes.

::::::::::: ''I don't see how or why our treatment of Norwegian usexes under one ==Norwegian== header would or should differ from our treatment of Serbo-Croatian or English usexes.'' Because Nynorsk and Bokmål are separate standards with different grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure etc. It's not adequate to give an example in only one of the two standards. And examples need to be attached to meanings. Your example at [[grey]] is not (even if it can be deduced which meaning is meant).
::::::::::: Either we duplicate the meanings in some way (such that the words are no longer treated simply as variants), or we keep the examples at the lemma page. Having references on the variant's page to meanings on the lemma page is unstable and does not strike me as a viable alternative.
::::::::::: Another issue is that Bokmål and Nynorsk can have two or more unique variants of a word, in which case it is not obvious where the examples of usage would be found; so there would be a need to duplicate the usage examples at up to at least 8 different entries (as an example, the Nynorsk word [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=fliseleggja&nynorsk=+&ordbok=nynorsk fliseleggja] has 8 variants: fliseleggja, fliseleggje, fliselegga, fliselegge, flisleggja, flisleggje, flislegga and flislegge)  --[[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 17:53, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== A new format for Chinese entries (multisyllables) ==
{{temp|look}}
At present, our Chinese (Mandarin mostly) entries are structured like [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2&oldid=25816297#Mandarin this]. This format has a number of drawbacks:
# It splits the Chinese heading into multiple headings, resulting in duplication of information, since the written form of Chinese is shared across Chinese varieties. It does not take into account the fact that simp-trad correspondences are shared by all Chinese varieties (hence hanzi-box is duplicated for every variety), the semantics is more than 99% of the time the same across dialects, and the etymology is essentially shared across dialects as well.
# It duplicates simp-trad conversions in hanzi-box and every headword template.
# It duplicates pronunciation in every headword template and in the Pronunciation section.
# It duplicates etymology in the hanzi-box and in the Etymology section.

As a consequence, the Chinese-language presence here has been overwhelmingly "Mandarin", which is the basis of {{w|Written Chinese}}, and limiting the growth of other varieties (cf. nouns - [[:Category:Mandarin nouns|Mandarin 20467]], [[:Category:Cantonese nouns|Cantonese 317]], [[:Category:Wu nouns|Wu 10]]). Hence a change in the format is much needed. I have created [[User:Wyang/歷史]] and some new templates (see below). What do people think of this format? The code for an entry in such format would be (excluding the temporary userspace markers since the templates do not exist yet):

<pre>
==Chinese==
{{wikipedia|lang=zh}}
===Etymology===
{{zh-forms|s=历史|to go through,<br>to experience|history,<br>records}}

First attested in ''{{w|Sanguozhi}}'', meaning "records of past events".

===Pronunciation===
{{zh-pron
|m=lìshǐ
|c=lik6 si2
|mn=le̍k-sú
|w=5liq sr
|ma=y|ca=y|wa=y
}}

===Noun===
{{zh-noun|hsk=b}}

# {{cx|obsolete|lang=zh}} [[record]]s of past events; [[historical]] records
# [[history]], [[past]]
# past [[experience]]s of a person, the history of a person
# ({{zh-l|歷史學}}) [[historiography]], the [[study]] of history

===See also===
* Synonyms: {{zh-l|過去|past}}, {{zh-l|以往|past}}
* Antonyms: {{zh-l|將來|future}}, {{zh-l|未來|future}}
* Derived terms: {{zh-l|歷史學|historiography}}, {{zh-l|歷史劇|historical play}}, {{zh-l|歷史觀|historical view}}, {{zh-l|歷史性|historic; of historic significance}}
* {{Sinoxenic-word|歷史|s=歴史|れきし|rekishi|역사|yeoksa|lịch sử}}

::I like it too. Since, as you, {{ping|Wyang}} mentioned, the presence here has been overwhelmingly "Mandarin", there is little concern about missing user examples in Cantonese, Min Nan, etc (such as examples of vernacular written Cantonese or Min Nan) but it's still possible. I suggest to use {{temp|cx|Cantonese|lang=zh}} whenever we have a specific variety entry, which should add to a corresponding subcategory.
::Categorising: I think specific terms, not used in standard Chinese (Mandarin), could be added to existing categories, such as [[:Category:Cantonese nouns]], which should in turn belong to [[:Category:Chinese nouns]].

:::Re: your example entry: [[User:Wyang/歷史]]:
:::Every foreign script entry has transliteration in the header, apart from Lao and Burmese, which have separate transliteration tables. Since Hanyu pinyin is the standard transliteration system for Mandarin, in my opinion, each PoS header should also repeat pinyin, like this: '''{{lang|cmn|歷史}}''' (lìshǐ) (even if they are multiple). I'm OK to move simp./trad. differences to the Hanzi section.
:::Entries should be sorted by numbered pinyin (as agreed previously), so 歷史 should be sorted by li4shi3 and appear under letter "L", not under character 歷 or radical 止. The simplified equivalent 历史 should be sorted the same way, as the current entry {{l|cmn|历史}}. We now have the functionality to convert toned pinyin to numbered pinyin, please consider adding this functionality for sorting.
:::Toned pinyin was specifically allowed by a vote and they are useful to locate Hanzi entries. Pinyin entries can also be generated in an accelerated method from entries.

::::Thanks.
::::1. We can add additional parameters to the pronunciation template, since string parsing is now achievable. We could, for example, use 
<pre>
{{zh-pron
|m=lìshǐ
|c=lik6 si2
|mn=le̍k-sú
|w=5liq sr
|ma=y|ca=y|wa=y
|cat=n,v,a,history!*,insects
}}
</pre>
:::::, which would add the page to the following categories: 1) "Chinese nouns", "Chinese verbs", "Chinese adjectives", "zh:History|*", "zh:Insects"; or 2) "Mandarin nouns", "Cantonese nouns", ... depending on what everyone prefers. Each of these categories would be sorted by the respective sort key, eg. Pinyin for "Category:Mandarin nouns". Regardless, one can always call variety-specific categories, using codes like <pre>{{cx|Cantonese|Wu|lang=zh}}</pre> in the definition.
::::2. Regarding headword templates - I think we can generalise it to something like [[Template:zh-pos]], since Chinese is uninflecting and there is no point in using a different base template for each PoS. I don't think the absence of a transliteration in the template is a problem. The requirement of transliterations is to guide pronunciation. Here the Pronunciation section has made romanisations and IPA pronunciations in various varieties sufficiently clear to readers, and I think we can use the precedent of Burmese entries (which also involves multiple transliterations) in this case.
::::3. Regarding Pinyin: Pinyin in the pronunciation template can be made clickable. And when acceleration creation is enabled in the preferences, one can click on the uncreated Pinyin in trad-form entries to create it. Trad-to-simp conversion can be performed hardly with any errors.

:::::Re: ''There is no point in using a different base template for each PoS.'' But that's how all all languages are structured here, including non-inflected ones. It allows categorisation and other things, e.g. for nouns, you can add optional measure words (classifiers). If they are simple, it just makes it easy when recreating each headword for each SoP.
::::: The suggested pronunciation section is quite big and may be even overwhelming to some users (I don't mean it's bad). What if more dialects are added? Having a simple pinyin looks much neater and that's what users see in published dictionary. Just standard pinyin in brackets, next to Hanzi, no other schema. Please consider. Burmese has various standards but I'd prefer that they've selected at least one to use in the headword, same with Lao. Just my opinion but that's also the established practice with current Mandarin entries. (Note that Burmese and Lao, currently a bit neglected have been maintained by one user each - Angr and Widsith but we have a bunch of editors with Chinese now). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 11:51, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::::::If we convert existing entries to this format, the vast majority will just have one variety in the Pronunciation section, i.e. Pinyin. The example I created was more of an extreme case - I doubt that section will be heavily populated by readings. Four (Mandarin, Cantonese, Min Nan, Wu) probably represents the limit. For other varieties, there is simply a lack of comprehensive dictionaries (not dialectal word dictionaries) like those dedicated to these four.
:::::::Regarding "see also" content - Those are not part of the change. The preference for clustered "see also" terms is more of a personal habit - I find it a little easier to locate content when various things are grouped by relatedness.
:::::::Burmese headword templates don't have transliterations ([[လောက]]). The transliterations are handled by [[Template:my-roman]], which is kind of similar to what the proposed template "Template:zh-pron" would do. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 12:17, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:I see three differences between the proposed format and our current format.
:# Some templates are changed. For the most part, the changes look like improvements, but proposed/new ''zh-pron'' needs more work: the proposed horizontal arrangement is so wide that smartphones and computers with small screens will have trouble with it, but the proposed vertical arrangement pushes the actual content (definitions) several screens down. (And if additional dialects are added, it will become even more unwieldy.) A large part of its bulk comes from its tabular format. Reworking it to use [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User:-sche/%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2&oldid=25821981 our usual bulleted-list format] would seem to solve these problems.

The proposed format would become particularly untenable whenever a word had a large number of synonyms, antonyms, and/or derived terms, like some of the words for tea probably do.
:# The proposal groups the various Chinese languages under one header. This is the bit that may be most controversial. As spoken, the varieties are often not mutually intelligible... yet (as has been noted) they are written the same way, and Wiktionary is a written dictionary.

Most entries won't have such a big variety, since we don't have editors and knowledge of dialects. The existing ones should be imported.
::On the main issue of merging all topolects into one L2 "Chinese" there has been surprisingly few comments. I'm sure there will be resistance, if there is a vote. Yes, all written forms can be accommodated into one Chinese section, despite them being not mutually intelligible (when spoken out loud!). Perhaps THIS problem should be solved first. There are other important improvements. If we ignore the pronunciation section (partially automated), entries will become easier to create. The main difficulty and source of errors for beginners was "rs" (radical sort) value, which stopped even native speakers from adding contents. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 01:25, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

:::Thanks. Format of the pronunciation template isn't an issue; it can be easily changed when all pages link to it, whether it be a table or a list. To me the list form is not as good-looking, but it is much easier to change to. I am not sure what was meant by the unresolved problem with the merger - like said above, variety-specific labels can be applied when necessary. Looking at [[:Category:Cantonese nouns]] and [[:Category:Min Nan nouns in traditional script]], most currently-existing entries in these varieties are not dialectal words. There isn't a huge number of currently-existing entries for other varieties (something less than 2000) compared with Mandarin (around 35000), and these can be manually examined one-by-one. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 04:17, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
::::The issue is not only technical but political. I know that most existing non-Mandarin entries only differ in pronunciation. The existing written dialectal forms not included here are small in number, even if they may be frequently used. I meant that in the past, after a seeming agreement in the BP, there was a vehement opposition to certain changes. Some editors are currently away or ignoring this page or, this change may create other issues later. If we have a successful vote, then there's no worry. Apart from Pinyin/Zhuiyn missing in the header (which I consider important and it matches the majority of our entries in non-Roman script) and minor formatting (please consider -sche's suggested format or similar) I personally have no issue with your proposal.

:::::(Cantonese native here) {{ping|Atitarev}} Thanks for notifying me. I '''support''' this proposal. By the way, this is a matter of merging different dialects of Chinese, so I think that [[WT:RFM]] should be notified for this matter. {{temp|context}} should also be modified so that it can show dialects, as I am aware that [[告白]] means a declaration of love in other dialects but advertisement (especially on television) in Cantonese. I support this proposal because I often see lack of definition in Cantonese entries while the definition is complete, precise and concise in their Mandarin section, and the definition in Cantonese is often the same as the definition in Mandarin. Still have to look out for dialectal differences, though. As a non-native speaker of English, I apologize for any misunderstanding that I have made. Here is what I mean for dialectal difference:
<pre>
==Chinese==
[pronunciation, etymology and rest of the stuff here]

===Noun===
{{zh-noun|[stuff goes here]}}

# {{context|Mandarin|Min Nan|[other dialects]|lang=zh}} a [[declaration]] of love, a [[confession]] of one's feelings towards someone
# {{context|Cantonese|lang=zh}} an advertisement broadcast on television

===Verb===
{{zh-verb|[stuff goes here]}}

# {{context|Mandarin|Min Nan|[other dialects]|lang=zh}} to [[declare]] love, to [[confess]] one's feelings towards someone
</pre>
:::::--[[User:Kc kennylau|kc_kennylau]] ([[User talk:Kc kennylau|talk]]) 09:03, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

::::::Thanks. I agree with you. BTW, apart from Cantonese, 告白 also means "advertisement" in some Mandarin dialects: eg. {{w|Changli}}, {{w|Hebei}} ({{w|Jilu Mandarin}}) - /kau55-43 pai13/; {{w|Ganyu}}, {{w|Jiangsu}} ({{w|Zhongyuan Mandarin}}) - /kau51-31 pei55/, and possibly in Taiwanese: [https://www.moedict.tw/'%E5%91%8A%E7%99%BD]. Also I think the sense of "declaration of love" is used in Cantonese too ([[google:告白嘅]]). So the page can go something like
<pre>
===Noun===
{{zh-noun|xxx}}

# [[announcement]], [[public]] [[announcement]]
# [[expression]] of one's thoughts; especially, [[declaration]] of love, [[confession]] of one's feelings towards someone
# {{cx|Cantonese|dialectal Mandarin|Min Nan|lang=zh}} [[advertisement]], [[ad]]

===Verb===
{{zh-verb|xxx}}

# to [[pronounce]]; to [[express]] oneself; especially, to [[declare]] love, to [[confess]] one's feelings towards someone

: This is a huge change. How will the existing entries be dealt? What about categories? We haven't yet resolved the issue with [*Category* in simplified/traditional script] categories. Don't get me wrong. I like where this is going. I am fully capable of creating entries in Wu, which is my native dialect, but it has been the amount of duplication that I have to deal with that puts me off creating any entries for it, so this change would be a big step forward.

* I'm going to sit out of this one. Although I'm one of the regular Mandarin editors here, my technical knowledge is close to zero, so I wouldn't be able to contribute much. However I do support the lumping of all Chinese languages under Chinese in theory. As the sandbox page currently stands, I don't like how the pronunciation boxes are so massive and keep pushing out to the right, it causes the whole page of my browser to elongate. There must be some way to condense this. I agree also that there should be separate headers for See also, Synonyms, etc. just like all the other languages' entries. Anyway, you guys are right - this is a huge proposal for change. Wyang has already contributed so much, I just hope that the transition can be relatively smooth - there are many other issues that need to be worked out first.

According to this [[Template_talk:audio#Categorisation]] this has been brought up (or at least was meant to?).

Lua (among other things) provides the functionality to compare the first x chars of a string to a set of values (correct me if I'm wrong). what could be the chances of using the language codes used in the names of all of pronunciation files to define a category "X terms with audio links" for that entry?

: I've added some code to add entries to [[:Category:Language code missing/audio]] if the <code>lang=</code> parameter is not present. That would currently include all entries that use {{temp|audio}}. The parameter itself doesn't do anything yet, I only made the change to give the category some time to fill up.
: I did notice something else about the template though. It checks for the presence of the first parameter (the sound file name), and only actually displays anything if that is present. But the first parameter doesn't default to it being empty, so {{temp|audio}} would display something, while {{temp|audio|}} would display nothing. This seems rather strange, so I wonder if that could be removed? Really, the first parameter should always be required, so leaving it empty should be an error; it shouldn't just cause the template to show nothing silently. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:09, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
:: The {{temp|audio-IPA}} template already has the lang= parameter and it's functional. I checked a few entries in [[:Category:Terms with audio links by language]] and they all used the {audio-IPA} instead of {audio}. So adding lang= to {audio} makes sense. While the 'terms with audio' category appears useful, my preference really is the index with immediate audio links, so users do not have to go to each entry to listen to the audio.

Why stop there? Why not pan out for the widest angle possible and include [[Earth]], [[Solar System]], [[Orion Arm]], [[Milky Way]], [[Local Group]], [[Universe]]?

: Thats an invalid comparison. I myself was unaware about the existence of some of these holonyms until a few years ago. Therefore I consider it to be educational since it offers one a varied vocabulary not only for others but myself too - hence i'm dissapointed with the reverts. Plus they deal with the ambiguity that is inherent in the language of some place names. You will notice that i usually ignore holonyms in matters unrelated to geography. This is because only in geography have such holonyms become of critical contemporary importance with intergovernmental organizations, multiregional international organizations, and supraorganizations being organized on the basis "detailed geographical information". I consider my addition to be akin to adding "Balkans" to the Bulgaria page. Nonetheless, i am willing to compromise and be less broad with a sense of proportion next time since that seems to be the main objection.

:@Pass a Method — Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's not our place to try to function as a sort of text-based atlas. There's an argument for listing "United States" as a hypernym of each of the U. S. states. But listing "Western Hemisphere" and "North America" is excessive, and opens the door to the listing of even larger, farther-removed regions to which, say, Vermont belongs (e.g. Orion Arm). It's also redundant, because the definition of, say, Vermont should be written in such a way as to communicate the fact that it's located in the United States, and the entry of the United States to communicate that it's in North America, and so forth. -[[User:Cloudcuckoolander|Cloudcuckoolander]] ([[User talk:Cloudcuckoolander|talk]]) 01:56, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

== Liaison in French ==

How would we express that "vous" would be pronounced /vuz/ when followed by a word beginning by a vowel or a mute h? Here are some of my suggestions:

# {{IPA|fr|/vu/}}, {{qualifier|in liaison}} {{IPA|fr|/vuz/}}

--[[User:Kc kennylau|kc_kennylau]] ([[User talk:Kc kennylau|talk]]) 10:49, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

::: French liaisons follow rules: all words beginning with a vowel sound can make a liaison with the previous word if it ends with a consonant. It is something that should be learned in general, not detailed in every word, except for the words that begin with a h which may be either (des [[héros]] = /de e.ʁo/, not /de.z‿e.ʁo/ ; but des [[habitude]]s /de.z‿a.bi.tyd/ not /de a.bi.tyd/) and other exceptions. [[User:Darkdadaah|Dakdada]] ([[User talk:Darkdadaah|talk]]) 14:59, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
:::: But ''vous'' does not end with a consonant, it's {{IPAchar|/vu/}} as shown above. From a phonological point of view, the {{IPAchar|/z/}} is unpredictable and just needs to be memorised. French grammar actually turns out to be vastly different from what we're accustomed to, if you take the pronunciation as the starting point. (Most nouns turn out to have no plural inflection anymore, for example; and for adjectives the feminine is actually the base form.) {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 15:17, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::::: I have always wondered if liaison in French would exist to the same extent if it weren't for the written language (i.e. spelling pronunciations).

:Similar question for (American) English: ''[[but]]'' is pronounced {{IPAchar|/bət/}} (let's say), but {{IPAchar|/bəɾ/}} before a vowel or {{IPAchar|/h/}}.

:: The change that you mention is predictable. If you know the pronunciation of the word in isolation, then you can predict the lenition of the final consonant depending on the next word. But for French that doesn't work; you have to learn the liaison consonant separately for every word. You can't predict {{IPAchar|/vu.z/}} from {{IPAchar|/vu/}}. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:16, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::: A better comparison would be a language with final devoicing, for which we indicate the devoicing in our transcriptions, but devoicing does not happen when followed by a word that starts with a vowel (let's ignore the case that the following word starts with a voiced consonant, because that could potentially voice previously unvoiced consonants). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:21, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
:::: That too, but I should note that not all languages with devoicing work that way. In Dutch for example it's actually ''morpheme-final'' devoicing, and it happens even to the first part of a compound. {{m|nl|badwater||bath water}} is {{IPAchar|[ˈbɑtˌʋaːtər]}} in normal speech. You rarely hear it pronounced with {{IPAchar|[d]}}, but that depends on dialect and also implicitly reflects a kind of "blurring" of the morpheme boundary, and therefore of the syllable boundary. It's also relatively uncommon with stops, a bit more common with fricatives. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 18:34, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
::::: You can also consider the inflected forms. I'm sure {{m|nl|bad|baden}} is pronounced with a /d/, right? But that is also easy to account for as a voiced inflection paradigm and an unvoiced inflection paradigm. In standard Russian, prepositions and some particles are the only words that regularly retain their voicing before words that start with a vowel; for example {{m|ru|над}}, even though we transcribe it as /nat/ is often actually pronounced /nad/ even in isolation, as attested in the audio sample in our entry. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:46, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

:: {{qualifier|in reply to [[User:Msh210|msh210]] 17:12, 16 March 2014 (UTC)}} This is a feature exhibited by some accents, in a given context /t/ would be realised as [t], [ɾ] or [ʔ] depending on the accent. But this is not phonetically relevant, as well as predictable. Besides, the liaison may be mandatory, forbidden or optional in a given context. Whether an optional liaison is made depends on the speaker, the level of speech –the more formal, the more liaisons are likely to be made–, and the speaker’s mood; it can even, along with elision and prosody, change the meaning, making the statement solemn rather than anodyne. So it’s way more complex than having allophones. – [[User:Pylade|Pylade]] ([[User talk:Pylade|talk]]) 11:28, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

== Redirects in [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|Wikisaurus]] ==

I would like to start using redirects in Wikisaurus because, the way that it is now, I have to search through synonyms of the word I'm looking for to find the page with synonyms of the word I'm looking for. For example, if I want synonyms for ''ceiling'', it is quite possible that a page for ceiling does not exist, and the synonyms that I'm looking for are on the ''roof'' page. However, I cannot do this at present (without messing up the system) because if (using the previous example) I make ''ceiling'' a redirect that sends people to ''roof'', then on the ''roof'' page the word ''ceiling'' has "[WS]" next to it, which links to the Wikisaurus page for ''ceiling''. (Wikisaurus does this automatically.) But then the link to the ''ceiling'' page is completely useless and misleading because it redirects to ''roof'', which is the page that the link is on.

I don't know what would be the best course of action here, but I think something should be done about this if possible. Any ideas?

* I '''oppose''' adding Wikisaurus-namespace-redirects to Wikisaurus, such as [[Wikisaurus:soda]] to [[Wikisaurus:soft drink]].

For instance, [[cat#Synonyms]] links to [[WS:cat]] and [[WS:man]].

== Suffix category name conflict ==

The Hungarian [[-ika]] suffix can form both diminutive nouns and can be the end of regular (non-diminutive) nouns.

What would be a good naming convention to resolve this with two categories? --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 20:58, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

== [[Template:only in]] with links to deleted ISO-639 appendices ==

Some ISO-639 language codes were listed first at rfv, then rfd (see [[talk:jv]]). It was finally decided to convert them to "only in" links to the appendices for ISO-639 codes. Now that the appendices have been deleted, we have a bunch of entries with basically nothing but explanations of why there's no entry and a referral to a non-existent appendix (see [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Appendix:ISO_639-1 language codes]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Appendix:ISO_639-3 language codes]]).

Should we:
# delete the entries?
# change them to link to the WP disambiguation page for the entry name?
# change them to link to the appropriate WP list of ISO 639 codes?
# change them to link to [[WT:LL]]?
# do something else?

== [[User:Pass a Method]] ==

Throughout their entire history of editing, this editor has demonstrated what can be described as either notoriously bad judgement or POV pushing. Highlights:

* A lack of understanding of metonymy ([[User talk:Pass a Method#person, penis]])
* Adding gratuitous references to, putting it broadly, contentious cultural and political issues, where they could have been easily avoided ({{diff|21387210|21235995}}, {{diff|22112919|21911422}}); blocked once before for it
* Not paying attention to spelling ([[Talk:antiSunni]]), parts of speech ([[User talk:Pass a Method#rolling the pill]]), headwords ([[User talk:Pass a Method#Synonyms for masturbation: beat the bishop, burp the worm, rolling the pill]]), or idiomaticity (created [[foot fetish]], [[Palestinian spelling]] and twice [[sexually suggestive]]; administrators can verify)
* Promoting obscure terms over popular ones ([[#Recent edits to US location entries]] above, {{diff|25633853|25815369|"ethnicist" or "religionist" over "ethnic" and "religious"}})
* Plain making up terms without verifying they are in use ([[WT:RFV#of Koranic proportions]], [[WT:RFD#traditional African religionist]])

The "good" edits are negligible, and almost always intertwined with some form of the above. Interacting with the user seems to be a waste of time: they are neither improving nor taking hints to leave. I propose an indefinite block. [[User:Kephir|Keφr]] 08:52, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

: This reminds me a lot of Gtroy/Acdcrocks/Luciferwildcat. In both cases they identified real problems in lack of coverage for controversial and/or unpopular subjects, but both exercised poor lexicographic judgment and a sort of counter-prescriptive wishful thinking: terms should exist or have the meanings they thought they should because it made sense in their way of thinking, and the only reason they weren't attested was censorship or bias in the coverage of available sources.
: The sad part is that a clear-headed search for religious and political biases in our entries was and is a good idea, and we needed and still need better coverage of terms that go against the biases of our contributor base. I just wish they had approached it with more common sense so that they wouldn't have wasted so much of their truly prodigious effort on bad edits.
:For all the time wasted in rfv and rfd of stuff that should never have been added, and all the checking needed to weed out the pov and the phoniness they've added to so many entries, they ''have'' made some real contributions in increasing our coverage of religious terms outside of mainstream Judaism and Christianity.

== Finnish accusative ==

There has been some disagreement between me and [[User:Hekaheka]] over the Finnish accusative case. In the past, our templates always showed at least two forms in the accusative singular box. One that had a form identical to the genitive singular, and one that had a form identical to the nominative singular. When I converted the templates to Lua, I removed the second one, because in my view this isn't an accusative case form at all, and the two aren't just interchangeable, they have separate uses. I wonder why the form that looks like the nominative is called an accusative at all. It's used primarily with imperatives, which have no explicit subject. So it's not a real accusative form in my opinion; it's just the nominative used in the role of imperative direct object. It's not uncommon for languages to use different cases in limited syntactic roles, than they would otherwise. In Slavic languages for example, negative verbs take an object in the genitive, but that doesn't mean that the genitive form should be included under "accusative". Likewise, languages like Icelandic or Latin may have a dative object, but that doesn't make the dative form accusative.

Hekaheka has argued that grammars and standard bodies have stated that there is no accusative case at all, and only a genitive. To me, this position is completely untenable, and this becomes clear when you look at the plural forms of nominative, accusative and genitive together:
* nominative: talo, talo'''t'''
* accusative: talo'''n''', talo'''t'''
* genitive: talo'''n''', talo'''jen'''
This clearly shows that there is no single case that aligns perfectly with accusative function, other than the accusative itself. If you eliminate the accusative as a case, then you end up with convoluted rules like "objects use the genitive in singular but nominative in plural", which doesn't help anyone.

It should also be noted that the identity between accusative and genitive forms is a historical accident, and is a result of sound change rather than a real functional identity between the two cases. In Proto-Uralic, the accusative had the ending -m, while for the genitive it was -n. In the prehistory of Proto-Finnic, final -m became -n, causing the two cases to become identical in form. So historically, there definitely was an accusative case, and the modern Finnish accusative singular -n is a direct descendant of that; it has nothing to do with the genitive. (The accusative plural is identical to the nominative; I don't know whether that's also a historical accident, or something else, but that's not relevant here.)

Since Hekaheka and I just keep arguing on this, I'm asking for wider feedback. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:09, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

:Hekaheka has said that there are two mainstream theories: one, which you summarize and criticize above, is that there is no accusative in modern Finnish, except perhaps in certain pronouns. The other is that there are two accusative forms in modern Finnish. Historically, Wiktionary accepted the latter view. ''If'' Hekaheka is right that these are the only two mainstream theories, I think we should continue to follow one of them — presumably the one we've been following — because I don't think the arguments of one person who doesn't speak Finnish are more convincing than the views of Finnish linguists.

: I've been taught that, if a language has grammatical cases, and a certain set of case endings is used for a distinct grammatical role, then the grammatical case for that grammatical role exists, even if the case endings it uses are shared with other case endings.
: Case in point (pun intended): German.  Broadly speaking, the feminine singular nominative matches the feminine singular accusative matches the plural nominative matches the plural accusative.  But we don't say that the plural nominative or accusative cases don't exist.  Similarly, the feminine singular dative matches the masculine singular nominative.  But we don't say that the masculine singular nominative doesn't exist.  Etc., etc.
: If the Finnish language has endings that function as a grammatical accusative case, i.e. a set of endings that are consistently applied when a noun is used as the grammatical object, then it follows that Finnish has a grammatical accusative case, even if those endings happen to be shared with other grammatical cases.
: [[Image:Blue Glass Arrow.svg|15px]] I think part of the confusion might stem from how the Finnish authors define “case”.  I don't read Finnish, but following the thread here and on CodeCat's Talk page, it sounds to my ears as though the Finnish authors in the "''accusative doesn't exist''" camp have taken the view that “case” == “distinct endings”.  Meanwhile, those authors in the "''accusative does exist''" camp have taken the view that “case” == “grammatical role”.  My bias is towards the latter.
: Either way, any in-depth treatment of Finnish grammar (perhaps [[WT:About Finnish]]) should at least mention that there are both interpretations, describe them briefly, and explain which interpretation Wiktionary entries adhere to.  &#8209;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 21:59, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

:: (E/C) I see this situation as being very similar to Russian. But even if you (like me) consider that Russian masculine nouns do not have an accusative case, which is instead supplemented by the nominative or genitive depending on animacy, it is not ''wrong'' to call the supplemented form an accusative. Also, history is completely irrelevant, otherwise Modern English has cases as well, only all the endings except for the genitive have merged. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

::*:: In Finnish, like IE, adjectives agree with nouns in case, and that agreement is what is generally considered to be evidence for case-ness in Finnish. Some grammars cite a "prolative" case for Finnish, or several others, but they don't show adjective agreement, so they are not considered true cases. As for English, it has a two-way case distinction in the pronouns, but not in the nouns (I don't consider the possessives a case; they were adjectives historically). So English has cases, but as a closed set and they are not productive. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:47, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

::*:::: Of nouns, yes. But the pronoun possessives were adjectives (or determiners) and agreed in case and number with the noun they modified, like they still do in German and in the Romance and Slavic languages. At least the first- and second-person ones did, but in German the third-person possessives now also inflect, so maybe that happened sometime in English history too before cases disappeared altogether. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:55, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

The point of view that I'm promoting is this (copied from en-Wikipedia article on {{w|accusative}}):
::According to traditional Finnish grammars, the accusative is the case of a total object, while the case of a partial object is the partitive. The <u>accusative is identical either to the nominative or the genitive</u>, except for personal pronouns and the personal interrogative pronoun ''kuka/ken'', which have a special accusative form ending in ''-t''. For example, the accusative form of ''hän'' (he/she) is ''hänet'', and the accusative form of ''kuka'' (or ''ken'') is ''kenet''.
As there are two singular accusative forms, our declension table should show both. If I have not misunderstood, CodeCat argues that only the genitive-looking form is a "true" accusative and therefore only it should be shown. --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 22:22, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
: Hekaheka also showed me this, which I found to be much more convincing evidence:
:: I know I'm walking on thin ice, but the thinking may depend on the fact that in case of personal pronouns (the only true accusative forms that everyone seems to agree on) the accusative is used as equivalent to both nominative and genitive accusatives. At a slave market one might say ''ostan orjan/ osta orja'' but if one uses ''hän'' instead of '' orja'', it becomes ''ostan hänet/ osta hänet''. The grammatical case must be the same both if the object is a noun or if it is a pronoun - ergo, there's a nominative accusative form. In the end, the existence of nominative-accusative is at least partially a question of convention, but this is anyway the convention that is widely agreed upon.
: (my reply, copied from my talk page):
:: Ok, that is an argument that does make some sense to me at least. The fact that the nominative of a noun becomes the accusative of a pronoun shows that there is a functional connection between the two.
:: But then, if we include them both under "accusative" then people may think that they're equivalent and interchangeable. We do the same with alternative genitive and partitive plural forms, after all. So I propose changing the table a bit, so that the "accusative" line becomes two rows high, and have two sub-rows each showing the two possible types of accusative. What should we call those sub-rows? Is the imperative the only case where the second accusative (the one like the nominative) is used, or are there others?
: {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:42, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

* I strongly feel that we should somehow differentiate the two forms. I do not know in what contexts each of them are used, but we can come up with names for those contexts and call them "X accusative" and "Y accusative". --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:46, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
:: As a native speaker of Finnish, I agree with everything Hekaheka has said on the subject. Thousands of Finnish declension tables are erratic now. Either put back the nominative in the accusative singular box, or remove all accusative boxes. User Jyril who created the old declension tables is quite competent too. CodeCat is welcome to invent new rules for Finnish grammar in the discussion rooms, but we cannot base the declension tables on them. --[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 11:59, 27 March 2014 (UTC) It would take several pages to explain the rules when to use nominative or genitive type. Native speakers go by ear, and foreigners never seem to learn them completely. You can call them "nominative type" and "genitive type" if that makes you happy.--[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 12:14, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
::: There don't seem to be any agreed-upon names for them. One paper I found on the subject labelled them the "n-accusative", "t-accusative" and "zero accusative". Since no words distinguish the t-accusative from any other type, we can ignore that and just label it "accusative" for those words. So should our tables name them "n-accusative" and "zero accusative"? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:32, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

::::: But what would concisely describe their function? The n-accusative is the "default", but the zero accusative isn't used in situations that form a clear pattern. It's used:
:::::* as the object of imperatives
:::::* as the object of passives
:::::* in some infinitive constructions
::::: and probably in some other situations as well; a native Finnish speaker could probably elaborate. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:48, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
::::::You cannot explain their function in one word. Any person who knows basic Finnish will know that object forms are tricky, and won't look for advice in a declension table. Just call them something. Hekaheka suggests nominative-accusative and genitive-accusative. Zero-accusative and n-accusative are fine with me too. Anything to stop this argument and finally fix the declension tables. --[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 16:33, 28 March 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Makaokalani, let's move into action. CodeCat, forget what I wrote about use of nominative-accusative on your discussion page and check {{w|Accusative case#Finnish}} instead. I erred with some infinitive and participle forms, because normally I don't need to think about them. Sorry for that. 
Anyway, we <u>must</u> change the current way of displaying Finnish accusatives, as it does not conform with any mainstream linguistic theories. I would be totally happy with the system we had, showing genitive-accusative and nominative-accusative forms in singular and nominative-accusative in plural without any further explanations. Those who don't understand why it's that way, may study Finnish grammar from available sources in the net and elsewhere or post a question on the Feedback page. After all, this is not the only unexplained thing in the table. I bet most users unfamiliar with Finnish will have a problem with understanding the concept behind "instructive", just to name one. If further labeling is deemed necessary, I have given one proposal in the discussion we had on CodeCat's discussion page. Another option is to link the word "Accusative" in the declension table to the page ''[[akkusatiivi]]'', which contains some discussion on accusative in Finnish and a link to Wikipedia. --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 20:39, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
: I've modified the table now. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:48, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::Good, thank you. But I still have a complaint about the table headers. The terms "zero?" and "normal" are not an even pair (or even a pair, if you like). The term zero-accusative refers to zero ending and its counterpart is n-accusative in which "n" is not short for "normal" but a reference to the "-n" -ending. Second, this discussion is the first time I ever hear the terms zero-accusative and n-accusative. ''Nominatiiviakkusatiivi'' (nominative-accusative) and ''genetiiviakkusatiivi'' (genitive-accusative) on the other hand seem to be used by many writers and they are also used in both English and Finnish Wikipedia. In order not to confuse the users of various Wiki sources it would probably be recommendable to use consistent terminology across the Wiki projects, even if it's not perfect. Therefore, change "zero?" to "nom." or "nom.acc." and "normal" to "gen." or "gen.acc.", please.  --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 23:13, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::: I'd prefer to avoid those terms as their names are not the clearest. "Genitive accusative" sounds like it's an accusative that is used together with a genitive or something like that. The terms "0-accusative" and "n-accusative" are used in the paper I mentioned, ''The Finnish accusative: Long-distance case assignment under agreement'' by Anne Vainikka and Pauli Brattico ([http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/files/_pubs_Vainikka/accusative11.pdf view]). I just switched it with "normal" because it is the normal default accusative case form, and because having just "zero" and "n" looks strange and doesn't say much. With the name "normal" it's clearer to readers that in most circumstances that's the accusative you should use. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:25, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Would it be clear? The nominative accusative could also be called "normal" because accusative plural is always identical with the nominative. And partitive is also used for objects of verbs, more often than the genitive accusative. The combination "zero" (for form) and "normal" (for imagined function) sounds illogical and a bit amateurish to me. Why not use the old terminology? It would make the Wiktionary sound more professional.--[[User:Makaokalani|Makaokalani]] ([[User talk:Makaokalani|talk]]) 10:09, 17 April 2014 (UTC)

== French open vowels ==

French has two open vowel phonemes, /a/ and /ɑ/, but many speakers make no or little difference between them, even though there exists minimal pairs. Therefore, either the underlying phoneme is /a/ or /ɑ/, pronunciation is often written down with only /a/ representing these two phonemes; and when one encounters /a/, one can never be sure that is a /a/ indeed.

To solve this issue, I think we should consider using /a/ where the underlying phoneme is not known or usage varies, and /æ/ where the underlying phoneme is /a/ indeed. That policy would not break any previously written entry as /a/ is confusing anyway.

What do you think of this proposition? – [[User:Pylade|Pylade]] ([[User talk:Pylade|talk]]) 20:59, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

: I'm sorry, but I think that's a really bad idea. Even if we could do that consistently, it would "solve this issue" only for those readers who knew that that's what we were doing.

:: That’s why this has to be a policy on which we collegially agree. Surely then we should link updated entries to a page describing the policy for French.

:::If even I — well acquainted with Wiktionary — and surely someone unacquainted with it — came across a pronunciation with {{IPAchar|æ}}, I'd assume it pronounced {{IPAchar|æ}}, not that it's pronounced some other way and I need to check a help page to see how.

== CheckUsers on Wiktionary ==

Hello. Wiktionary has been getting quite a few spambots recently, most of which are blocked by some lovely abusefilters. However, it would be very useful to be able to get CheckUser data for those accounts, which could be used to prevent spam elsewhere. All of the current CheckUsers here are inactive, so would it be possible to elect some new ones, or modify the local checkuser policy to allow stewards to check locally in cross-wiki cases, such as anti-spam? Regards, [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] ([[User talk:Ajraddatz|talk]]) 04:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

:Yeah ... we really do need to de-checkuser the inactive checkusers, and elect new checkusers. And possibly also allow stewards to check locally in spam cases, although if we do the first two things, that will be less important.

:To expand on my earlier comment (aware that this is ''somewhat'' tangential)... allowing inactive users to retain admin rights, as en.Wikt often does, is one thing; it can even be useful, in that it allows the users to immediately resume blocking vandals and deleting vandalism if they do return for short spurts of activity. Allowing inactive users to retain checkuser rights is different. Checkusers are in a powerful position to invade other users' privacy. <br>I stumbled across an old thread some time ago in which someone had proposed requiring that people undergo checkuser checking before being granted things like adminship. An admin had replied that he would be wary of that, since he actually had to change accounts because someone had stalked him under his previous wiki account and in real life. <br>Accordingly, checkusers should be people who are very active, because they should be people who are trusted by the ''current'' community (not just the community of users who elected them and then themselves became inactive). They shouldn't be just minimally active (en.WP requires one edit per year to retain admin rights, I think), they should be so active that the ''current'' community knows them; otherwise, the community isn't in a position to evaluate their trustworthiness. Also, checkusers should be people who are very active so that they can respond to situations as they arise. It's not as useful for an inactive checkuser to return seven months from now and tell us who was running the spambots. <br>Also, the Meta Checkuser policy states: "On any wiki, there must be at least two users with CheckUser status, or none at all. This is so that they can mutually control and confirm their actions. In the case where only one CheckUser is left on a wiki (when the only other one retires, or is removed), the community must appoint a new CheckUser immediately (so that the number of CheckUsers is at least two)." [...] "Any user account with CheckUser status that is inactive for more than a year will have their CheckUser access removed." <br>Looking at [[Special:ListUsers/checkuser]], we are violating the spirit of that, if not the letter:
:# Versageek has made 8 edits since 2009, half of them in 2010. I don't know them, and I'd hazard a guess that a sizeable number of our current editors (who joined after 2009) don't know them, either. They may be a great person, but I don't know that.
:# Rodasmith made 5 edits last year, and 2 in 2012. 
:# Connel MacKenzie made 4 edits last year, 4 edits in 2012 (all to react to a motion that they be desysopped for inactivity by accusing one of the makers of the motion of bad faith), and just one edit in 2011 (which is why there was a motion to desysop them for inactivity). 
:# TheDaveRoss was reasonably active last year.
:I think we should de-checkuser the first three, and then (per the Meta policy) either de-checkuser Dave or else appoint a new checkuser. Who wants to draft the de-checkuser votes?
:Incidentally, I thought the folks at meta had a vote and were going to automatically desysop any of our admins (and presumably also checkusers, etc) who were inactive for more than 2 years, on the basis that we were failing to do so ourselves.

:Well, I initially postponed the vote so that we could discuss what level of community support would be required for a user to retain rights vs lose them. Some users were of the opinion that rights (like blocks) are granted to people that the community thinks should have them, and if there is no longer a (vote-passage-sized, e.g. ~2/3) majority of the community which thinks the users should have the rights/be blocked, the rights/blocks should be rescinded. (This philosophy prevailed in a vote on unblocking a certain user, but debates over user rights have been different.) Other users were of the opinion that once a user was given rights, they should retain them unless a sufficiently large (vote-passage-sized) majority favoured removing them. Like many discussions here, that discussion petered out without a clear conclusion. I would suggest restarting it (probably in a new thread) before restarting the vote.

== A Different Way To Look At Chinese? ==

I've been doing some thinking about Chinese, trying to sort out the implications of the different ways we've treated the Chinese lects. I can't say that I have a clear solution, but I have the inklings of what seems to me like a more rational conceptual framework. It may be incompatible with our current infrastructure, but here it is: 

Let's assume that Chinese is a strictly written language, originally based on an earlier spoken lect, but that has developed since on its own independent of the spoken language(s). In this respect, it reminds me a lot of sign languages such as American Sign Language.

The "dialects" are independent, but strictly spoken languages which are translated into dialects of written Chinese when they are written. That makes written Chinese a sort of lingua franca that's used to communicate between speakers, though the example of the [[w:Code Talker]]s comes to mind, as well.

Following from that, Chinese would be considered a language, but so would Cantonese, Hakka, Mandarin, Min Nan, Wu, Xiang, etc (and/or some of their subdivisions and/or fellow members of their dialect groups, as well).

Some aspects would be complementary in distribution: pronunciation would be strictly for the spoken lects and orthography for the written one. Morphology and syntax, on the other hand, are partly tied in with the writing, but have dimensions that the writing simply doesn't address. Etymology of the spoken lects is quite different from that of the written, but there again, intertwined with it. Lexicon is also quite distinct, but there are regional terms in the writing and I'm sure the writing contributes to the spoken lects as well.

I'm not sure if this is developed enough to provide anything useful, but I thought I would present it and see what others think.

: NB: A 'classical chinese' (WMF lang code zh-classical) written dialect dates from at least the 9th century ce, while an updated 'vernacular chinese' (WMF lang code zh) written dialect dates from at least the 20th century ce.

::Most of the modern written Chinese is basically the same across all Chinese varieties, e.g. standard written Cantonese only differs from standard Chinese (Mandarin) in style and word choices, pronunciation (when read out loud) and use of traditional Chinese (e.g. in Hong Kong) (the latter is not really a difference, since Mandarin is also written in traditional characters in Taiwan and Cantonese is written in simplified characters in [[Guangdong]]). Vernacular forms of dialects when written down differ more from standard Chinese as there are very common words, which are not used in Mandarin or have a different meaning. The specific words are very low in number, even if they are very common, every day words.  Some spoken dialects simply lack the writing form or is not common and attestable.

== Automatizing {{temp|rhymes}} with Lua, merging it into {{temp|IPA}}, and reforms in pronunciation section ==

Automatizing {{temp|rhymes}} looks feasible. The template that takes IPA pronunciation can generate the title of the corresponding rhymes page (at least for English, I don't know about rules of rhymes in other languages). Any opinions/objections about automatizing it?

On the other hand, the structure of pronunciation sections of Wiktionary looks quite stupid and needs some reform:
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈwɔːtə(ɹ)/|a=UK}}
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈwɔtɚ/|a=US}}, {{enPR|wôtər}}
:* {{audio|en|En-uk-water.ogg|Audio (UK)}}
:* {{audio|en|en-us-water.ogg|Audio (US)}}
:* {{rhymes|en|ɔːtə(ɹ)|ɒtə(ɹ)}}
Note how things such as the word "Audio" and the accent labels ("UK", "US") and the symbols (ɔːtə(ɹ), ɒtə(ɹ)) are being repeated. Maybe it should be something like:<!--Commented out to prevent template errors.
:* {{IPA|en|/ˈw[[Rhymes:English:-ɔːtə(ɹ)|ɔːtə(ɹ)]]/|a=UK}} {{audio|en|En-uk-water.ogg}}

== Über-template with tabular output for pronunciation section ==

This is inspired by opinions from [[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahagn Petrosyan]] and [[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]].

We can create a single, Lua-powered template for pronunciation section, which would generate a table similar to that of below. This template would be able to automatically generate IPA pronunciation for certain languages (for now, only ready for Armenian, Georgian, Polish, Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Ukrainian and to some extent for Persian and Ancient Greek), possibly rhymes (discussion at above), and hyphenation (for American English, etc.) wherever possible. (these are feasible from technical aspect)

Both output and input of the proposed template are more readable and the output doesn't have duplications that can be seen in the current format. It also takes and shows information more precisely (in the current format of our pronunciation sections, it is often unclear which, say, audio, or which homophone corresponds to which IPA pronunciation when there's more than one phonemic pronunciation for a given accent, which is the case for "US" here):

Second, because this eliminates the possibility of adding helpful tooltips indicating what sounds each symbol is for. (I think this would be quite helpful, as many readers don't know IPA. I set up something like this for Wikipedia at [[w:Module:IPAc]], but it never got used.) Third, because this way rhymes can't be shown at all if the full pronunciation details aren't available.

===Implementation===

There are a few things that need to be sorted out, as the parameters given above are a nice ideal, but there are some practical problems.
* Hyphenation is not actually a pronunciation thing, so it probably doesn't belong in the pronunciation section, let alone in this table. It's also redundant to list it for each pronunciation as it's going to be pronunciation-independent.
* The suggested way of specifying parameters doesn't say anything about the order in which the columns should be shown. While you can specify parameters in a different order on calling the template, this information is lost in the translation to Lua or the template. So the module would have no way of knowing that IPA goes before audio, unless we hard-code it into the module itself. That, of course, means that we'd have to maintain a list of valid columns, and reject any that are not recognised. It's not ideal.
* Consider also the changes that are in progress with Chinese entries. They also use a table structure but it expands. See for example [[User:Wyang/告白]]. It may not be the best thing to have one format for Chinese and another for all other languages. So we may want to consider a way to accommodate both.
* What should go in the first column when there is only one pronunciation?

It looks good. The plain version is better, because the table lines and tone are just visual distraction. It would be more readable if every header and body cell were left-aligned.

If we're putting homophones in the template we should decide what it looks like if you have a lot- vertical list? expandable? [[User:DTLHS|DTLHS]] ([[User talk:DTLHS|talk]]) 23:49, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

:Like many languages, English has a very large number of dialects. At present, people can add information on these dialects' pronunciations of words rather simply: they just copy a line of the current format and change the {{temp|a}}, expanding
<pre>
* {{IPA|/maɪt /|lang=en|a=GenAm}}
* {{IPA|/mɑːt/|lang=en|a=Southern US}}
</pre>
:to e.g.
<pre>
* {{IPA|/maɪt /|lang=en|a=GenAm}}
* {{IPA|/mɑːt/|lang=en|a=Southern US}}
* {{IPA|/mæːt/|lang=en|a=Old Virginia accent}}
</pre>
:and {{temp|a}} is flexible enough to handle this. Your proposed format seems to use dialects' names in the names of parameters ("UK-IPA=", "UK-audio=", etc). Does this mean we would have to anticipate and code into the template/module, in advance, every dialect of every language that the template covered, or people would not be able to add those dialects' pronunciations of words? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 01:29, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
:: Lua is capable of iterating over all parameters. So it's able to "find" parameters whose name is not known in advance. It does require that the parameters follow some predictable pattern so that the module knows which part of the name it should interpret as a dialect name. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Yes. But there is also a nice solution to avoid problems such as following restricted patterns and long names for parameters: (for 2nd row)
<pre>
|2= US
|2-IPA= ...
|2-audio= ...
</pre>
::: this way, we'd be able to put more than one dialect/variety in a single row: by passing them to a numbered parameter, separated by comma or something: {{para|2|UK, US}}. We can also define subvarieties which would be placed in the second column, by passing them to {{para|''n''-''n''}} where ''n'''s are numbers, which is especially useful in Chinese entries.
:::Regarding columns, and whether they should be hard-coded, I think specific columns should be defined with a default order, but we should probably be allowed to override it by defining new columns and their order using special parameters, like {{para|column''n''}}.
:::If the {{para|''n''}} parameters are not specified (usually when we have only one row), the first column should be omitted.
:::I think hyphenation belong somewhere in PoS section, near headword line where we show the word, maybe floating on the right side, like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=User:ZxxZxxZ/sandbox&oldid=26087029 this].

::::I support the idea of using a single template to cover all the English pronunciation information. In the case of English, it might be useful to pre-define some commonly used dialectal names, such as 'UK', 'RP', 'US', 'GenAm', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Ireland', 'New Zealand' and 'South Africa', so that one can use
<pre>
{{pronunciation|lang=en
|UK-IPA= ...
}}
</pre>

::::without having to identify the variety in a separate parameter. The case of Chinese is a little different from English, as the internal divisions of Chinese are well-defined from centuries of Chinese dialectology (Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, etc.), with each division having a prestige dialect (usually the dialect of the largest city), whereas English accents are less well-defined. Regional Chinese accents are associated with locations ({{w|List of varieties of Chinese}}, eg. Beijing, Guangzhou), while English accents tend to be characterised by region/area (eg. Southern US). Hence, I would prefer if {{temp|zh-pron}} has parameters 'm=PINYIN', 'c=JYUTPING', 'w=ROMANISATION' for prestige dialects, and 'm-LOCATION_A=IPA', 'm-LOCATION_B=IPA' for other varieties. In contrast, the English template is probably better without a set of predefined divisions (as the example above |1= ... |2= ...), but with some predefined commonly used parameters, as said above. As for rhymes, I think they should be kept separate from the IPA template. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 03:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users. 

For more information:

== Words used "in dialects, including A, B, C" ==

Quite a few entries use the labels "dialectal", "dialect" and "dialects". This is allowable, because sometimes a user may not know which dialects a word is used in. But we should always ''attempt'' to be more specific, IMO. I'd like to make people aware of the label "including", which allows listing dialects in a way that makes clear the list isn't exhaustive. E.g. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=favor&type=revision&diff=33158759&oldid=33158345 in the entry ''favor'']: {{temp|lb|en|transitive|in|_|dialects|including|Southern US|and|Cajun}} → {{lb|en|transitive|in|_|dialects|including|Southern US|and|Cajun}}. (I can also find evidence that the sense was used in British dialects a century ago; I don't know whether it still is or not.)

== Flash card function for language learning publicly requested ==

In [http://niamey.blogspot.com/2015/07/wiktionary-as-tool-for-african-language.html this blog article] the author suggests the desirability of having the Wiktionaries offer a flash-card like system for learning African languages. The advantage of hosting such a system is that it would offer the opportunity for teachers or advocates of the language to add entries to the languages of interest to them to achieve sufficient language coverage to make the effort worthwhile. This came up on the Wiktionary-l mailing list, so we should try to make as constructive response as possible. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  18:39, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

:I've been extracting flashcard files (for Anki et al.) from the dumps for personal use for several years (one component of a language-learning program that has helped me earn a tidy little set of ATA certifications). It would be fairly trivial to make such files available on a regular basis for any given set of languages. -- [[User:Visviva|Visviva]] ([[User talk:Visviva|talk]]) 21:44, 2 July 2015 (UTC)
::I ''think'' the blog author and the fellow who put it on the mailing list may be looking for more. Actually there must be good, free web-based software or free applications that could run this. Perhaps we could assemble a list with links and select words and (god help me) phrases suitable for basic word and phrasebook flashcards. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  21:57, 2 July 2015 (UTC)
::: FWIW, [http://ankisrs.net Anki] is open source and has web-based, desktop and app versions.  The author's idea of a "flashcard mode" for Special:RandomInCategory is interesting (and could be accomplished with some clever JavaScript, I think), and could have some real pedagogical value if combined with a "basic words" category (rather than an "all lemmas" category), but it would still be a pretty poor substitute for a proper spaced-repetition flashcard program. -- [[User:Visviva|Visviva]] ([[User talk:Visviva|talk]]) 22:44, 2 July 2015 (UTC)
::::The common element is the core list of words for all languages and some target-language-specific words. I wish I could do it. All I'd need is the talent.

There are the Swadesh lists, but we have to add some more contemporary material. I liked the spirit and tone of the original Gimmick series. Anyway, we can take requests if we want.

== Presentation of Katharevousa Greek in en:Wiktionary. ==

I currently treat Katharevousa as shown [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B8%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%AF#Greek here], entering it as an alternative form of the Standard Modern Greek one. Where an SMG form does not exist I would define it thus:<br>
:1. (''[[Katharevousa]]'') suitable translation<br>

Does this seem the appropriate treatment. Are there better, different examples in other languages? <br>

There are two distinct "areas": "polytonic orthography" is the one and the other is "Katharevousa". "Katharevousa" has only "polytonic orthography" but "Demotic Greek" (official language of Greece since 1976) was also printed in "polytonic orthography" (officially until 1982).  But there are polytonic forms that belong purely to "Demotic Greek" (βασιληᾶς or βασιλιᾶς). Also  "Demotic Greek" is not a "descendant" of "Katharevousa". But there are many words created (most translated or transliterated) during the period where "Katharevousa" was official language and thus can be somehow stated that come from "Katharevousa".  IMHO "Katharevousa" should be used only if form has only "polytonic orthography" and the printed word cannot be treated as a polytonic form of a word in use. Also "Katharevousa" is far more distinguished by her own set of grammatical and syntactical rules which cannot be "presented" in individual lemmas. (about the above mentioned example: [[Ἀριθμοί]] is the polytonic form of [[Αριθμοί]] which, in turn, comes from Ancient Greek Ἀριθμοί and not from "Katharevousa"). --[[User:Xoristzatziki|Xoristzatziki]] ([[User talk:Xoristzatziki|talk]]) 16:14, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
: As a start, and by way of suggestion, I have made some changes to [[Αριθμοί]] and [[Ἀριθμοί]]. A suggested category might be [[:Category:Polytonic Greek]].

== eye dialect ing ==

I'm curious about the policy on eye dialect spellings of ing verbs in English. For example we have ''[[walkin']]'' but not ''[[buyin']]''. AFAICT none of the eye dialect spellings are cited. Is there a special policy on when to include them? Just to pick an obscure verb, with a little casual googling I found a use for [https://books.google.com/books?id=BiHeHTaeZAsC&pg=PA12&dq=transmogrifyin%27&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8uSXVZPbGIm0-QHzvYH4Dg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=transmogrifyin%27&f=false transmogrifyin'] -- just one, but if I could find one barely looking, I bet there are more out there. Do we make pages for every English verb where someone has written it like that enough times to meet CFI? Are we actually required to find examples? There are no examples for any eye dialect words I've checked including some ones I'd have been surprising to find in writing, like ''[[agonizin']]'' and ''[[considerin']]'' (neither of which have any easy to find results on Google Books). Just curious if this has been discussed, I don't plan on mass-making these pages or nominating them for deletion or anything like that. [[User:WurdSnatcher|WurdSnatcher]] ([[User talk:WurdSnatcher|talk]]) 13:58, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
:I personally consider them less useful than "common misspellings", as the general rule of dropping the "g" becomes obvious to a language learner rather quickly.

:I don't think there's been any major discussions about appendices.
:Personally, I can think of some guidelines I've been applying to them when possible:
:* Language should be in the title: In 2010 [[Appendix:Dictionary-only terms]] was moved to [[Appendix:English dictionary-only terms]]. Glossaries would be an exception ([[Appendix:Glossary of legal terms]] and the like) because most of those are lists of English words without "English" in the name, but I'm not very happy about that because we could have FL versions of those, like [[Appendix:Glossary of Portuguese legal terms]], actual appendix name TBD.
:* Place all language-specific appendices in language-specific appendix categories, e.g. I believe [[Appendix:English nouns]] should either be in [[:Category:English appendices]] or a suitable subcategory, in this case [[:Category:English grammar appendices]]. In the past many appendices were in the main language category such as [[:Category:English language]].
:* Sometimes a page is moved between Appendix<->Wiktionary namespaces, this would be because appendices are of interest outside of the scope of Wiktionary, Wiktionary namespace is for Wiktionary policies.

== Using BBC Voices as a source ==

A few years ago, the BBC organized a large series of conversations between members of the public across the country about their dialects/accents. This information is now [http://sounds.bl.uk/Accents-and-dialects/BBC-Voices maintained by the British Library] (so we can assume it's permanently archived) and although the files don't have full transcripts (just summaries), it's still a useful source for a lot of terms that are difficult to archive. To pick a random example, several participants in [http://sounds.bl.uk/Accents-and-dialects/BBC-Voices/021M-C1190X0009XX-0401V0 the Hartlepool conversation] use the word [[cuddy-wifter]]/[[cuddywifter]], which is difficult to cite even in its standard meaning of "left-handed person" (only one non-mention on Google Books), but as comes out in the course of the chat it has an additional meaning on [[Teesside]] of "[[Catholic]]". Given that a lot of the problems that we have with collecting dialectal terms is that they are often used in speech but seldom written down, can we use this archive as a citation?

I recall from discussions of personal names and some other words that many other dictionaries don't distinguish proper from common nouns, and a surprising number of works, even high school and college English textbooks, erroneously equate "proper noun vs common noun" with "capitalized vs lowercase". Merriam-Webster, Dictionary.com, Collins and Cambridge all have "Buddhism", "Paul" and "White House" all just labelled ''noun'', strongly suggesting that they simply don't distinguish proper from common nouns.

:''The Penguin Writer's Manual'' (2004, {{ISBN|0141924829}} says this: 
:: A '''proper noun''' is a noun that denotes a specific person or thing. It is, to all intents and purposes, a name. [...] Proper nouns include people's first names and surnames, the names of places, times, events, and institutions, and the titles of books, films, etc. They are spelt with an initial capital letter: ''Sam'', ''Shakespeare'', ''New York'', ''October'', ''Christmas'', ''Christianity'', ''Marxism'', and ''Coronation Street''. All nouns that are not proper nouns are known as '''common nouns'''. [...]
:: Apart from being spelt with an initial capital letter, proper nouns have other characteristics that usually distinguish them from common nouns. They do not, generally, have a plural and they are not, usually, preceded by ''a'' or ''an''. There is only one ''Australia''; there was only one ''Genghis Khan''. [...] there are many exceptions to [this]. There are occasions when either a specific example or several examples of something denoted by a common noun must be referred to: ''keeping up with '''the Joneses'''''; [...] ''one of the warmest '''Januaries''' on record''.
: The manual then goes on to describe concrete nouns (like ''table'') and abstract nouns (like ''happiness'' and ''unity''), countable nouns (''table'' again) and uncountable nouns (''mud'', ''foliage''), and collective nouns (''flock'').

: '''Comment:''' While there are some borderline cases, such as the names of months and days, most nouns can be readily distinguished as common or proper. The actual ''criteria'' and grammar of proper nouns are of far more debate, albeit philosophical. The problem arises in that the names of abstractions and philosophies behave grammatically much like proper nouns. Is {{m|en|socialism}} a common noun or a proper noun? In older texts, it was capitalized and treated much like {{m|en|Confucianism}} or {{m|en|Christianity}}.  All three are philosophies. Further, capitalization cannot always be relied upon as a guide, since a number of common nouns and even adjectives are capitalized by virtue of their etymological source (e.g. {{m|en|Welshman}}, {{m|en|French dressing}}, {{m|en|African}}). --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 20:27, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

== Language labels within Translingual citations ==

At the moment we have 30 pages in [[:Category:Translingual citations]].

I found them to lack consistency as some of those had only a "English citations" section while others had a "Translingual citations" section without specifying which language is each citation. So I am trying a new format to standardize them all.

See [[Citations:VL]]. I separated the citations with language-specific labels within the "Translingual citations of VL" section. I also put them in the respective language categories: [[:Category:English citations]], etc. (Maybe something like [[:Category:Translingual citations in English]] could be an improvement. Still, maybe this level of granularity is not necessary now because there are only few of those citations. If we had hundreds of Translingual citations I might think differently.) I made sure all the 30 pages are following this new format at the moment. I'd like some feedback to see if other people like this format or it could be improved some other way.

Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:30, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
: I'm thinking that there should be no such thing as a translingual citation. The citation itself is in a language, even if the term it's citing is used cross-language. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:03, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
:::@[[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]]: I disagree with you on this point. IMO, having "Translingual citations" mirroring the Translingual section of the entry itself is useful because allows us to group different language citations into the same senses. See [[Citations:(]], specifically sense "Punctuation mark: expands a word into another word, inflection or spelling"; it has both Portuguese and English examples. It could have even dozens of languages in the future. It serves for easier comparison of how the same specific sense is used, to check if the Translingual definition is true in all languages. Current sense at [[(]] is inaccurate. It is: "Begins denoting an alternative option for a '''preceding''' word. / dog(s)", but there are citations with "colo(u)r" and "(re)criação" (Portuguese). For punctuation marks, one could even argue that one sense of a punctuation mark is truly "Translingual" if it has been attested in multiple languages; [[¿]] has only the Spanish section. But taxonomic names would be truly Translingual even if attested in only one language, I hope: [[Citations:Anous stolidus]] has only one Portuguese citation at the moment. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 02:21, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
::The Translingual case shows that the naming convention for the citations categories assumes there to be no difference between the language label for the term and the language label for the citation. AFAICT only Translingual violates the assumption, though Translingual itself is a highly heterogeneous collection of ideograms, symbols, taxonomic names, and other scientific names. Arguably it should also include Latin-derived term that appear in medical, legal, even alchemical running text of many languages.
::IMO, Any citation pages for Translingual terms should remain where they are and those pages should be categorized as Translingual, eg, the current [[:Category:Translingual citations]]. IMO, there could certainly be additional categorization into categories for the language in which the translingual term is embedded in each citation. This would enable the citation to be found and reused for citing the terms of its language that it includes and subjected to any language-specific maintenance that might be required. 
::I don't see any great advantage to having a category like [[:Category:Translingual citations in English]] rather than two categories: [[:Category:Translingual citations]] and [[:Category:English citations]], but one disadvantage: there is no simple single category that contains all the pages bearing in whatever content namespace that have all the citations in each language.

::::: I think the Chinese entries are a possible model: we should have a collapsible pronunciation table along the lines of the translation table, since the same symbol is read out loud in different languages and dialects as [[period]], [[full stop]], [[point]], [[Punkt]], etc. One problem to deal with: scientific names, at least, also have syntactic information in various languages. For instance, scientific usage in English is to refer to "the family [[Malvaceae]]", but a lot of people who aren't familiar with this refer to "the [[Malvaceae]] family". Another is that scientific names are more often read than heard, so pronunciation can vary widely from person to person: I would pronounce [[Malvaceae]] as something like /malˈvej si ej/, but I often see the pronunciation given as /malˈvej si i/. Writing for the public on pronouncing scientific names tends to say things like "there's no one right way to say it- everyone is different". This is especially true when scientific names are based on names of people: if one recognizes the name, one may pronounce it after the pronunciation of the person's name, rather than by the usual rules. For example, "hopei" might be pronounced as two syllables or three, depending on whether one notices that it's based on the surname [[Hope]].

::::::::: While this approach sound good in theory, it has little practical value. The prescriptive back-constructed Classical Latin pronunciations are not actually used by modern scientists in the area of taxonomy.

Even the family names in botany vary wildly in their use pronunciations by country, and none of them use the Classical-style pronunciation that I have ever heard (and I've heard US, UK, Danish, French, and Portuguese botanists). 
::::::::: So, what would be the point of prescribing pronunciations that no one actually uses?

== "Audio" in front of pron files for non-pluricentric languages ==

Do languages that do not have several very well established regional varieties (an example of this could be English (US), English (UK), English (Aus), etc.) need the text "Audio" [[prepended]] before their pronunciation file players? [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 20:31, 9 July 2015 (UTC)

'''Proposal for a "best practices" recommendation''': "Audio" before a pronunciation file should be used only in the presence of some other qualifier. It is otherwise redundant As bullet points are used to itemize/list text, a bullet point is not to be used either (because a Flash element is not text.) (Ping some users whose editing involves pronunciation files [[User:Pereru]], [[User:Panda10]], anyone else welcome to express their opinion.)

Pronunciations would be formatted in the following way for pluricentric languages languages:

* {{IPA|en|/ˈpɝsən/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-person.ogg|a=US}}
* {{audio|en|En-uk-person.ogg|a=UK}}

And the following way for languages whose pronunciation files usually do not feature additional qualifiers:

* {{lv-IPA|akustice}}
* {{audio|lv|lv-riga-akustiķe.ogg}}

or

* {{IPA|hu|/ˈɒmɛrikɒ/}}
* {{audio|hu|Hu-Amerika.ogg}}
* {{hyphenation|hu|Ame|ri|ka}}

'''Modified 2nd version''': "Audio" is not to be used in the absence of some other qualifier but bullet point must be used.

'''3rd version''': "Audio" is not to be used in the absence of some other qualifier. An editor can choose whether to use a bullet point. ({{template|IPA}} ''doesn't appear to be checking for namespace when adding categories the IPA examples should be removed from this page at some point or namespace-checking/cat suppression should be added to the template''.)

:I think the bullet point should be retained in all cases.

:If we were to drop "Audio" from non-pluricentric languages, could we just drop it from all languages? Then we would have:

==Old Italic standardization proposals==

I've recently been working on [[Module:Ital-translit]] and [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and have come to the point where I need some oppinions. The <tt>Ital</tt> code block does not currently possess all the characters needed fully to encode all the languages that use it; so I propose the following rules to standardize the <tt>Ital</tt>'s use. Previous conversations maybe found at [[User talk:JohnC5#Testing transliteration modules]] and [[WT:Beer parlour/2013/June#South Picene alphabet]].

===Proposal 1:All entries should be written left-to-right===

The majority (if not all) of the languages that use <tt>Ital</tt> are written [[boustrophedon]] and thus could have lemmata appearing in left-to-right or right-to-left order. Modern scholarship, however, tends to merely unspool the inscriptions and then present them in left-to-right order. I therefore propose that all languages using <tt>Ital</tt> should be lemmatized in left-to-right order.

===Proposal 2:Allow alternative use of Ital characters===

For much of <tt>Ital</tt> script, the character may be transcribed unambiguously or with only minor phonetic deviations from the canonical. Examples are represented be a <span style="background:#C0CFE4;">blue</span> box in [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and include:
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌂}}: canonical - '''''c'''''; Camunic, Oscan, South Picene, Noric, North Picene - '''''g'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌅}}: canonical - '''''v'''''; Old Latin - '''''f'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌈}}: canonical - '''''θ'''''; Umbrian - '''''t'''''; Noric - '''''d'''''
However, in some cases, one language may use one glyph to represent an entirely different sound (whether by innovation of a new but similar letterform or by reällocation of a previous letterform). Examples are represented be a <span style="background:#FF3232;">red</span> box in [[Appendix:Old Italic script]] and include:
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌁}}: canonical - '''''b'''''; Camunic - '''''ś'''''; Raetic - '''''tʼ / þ'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌑}}: canonical - '''''ś'''''; Camunic - '''''b'''''; South Picene - '''''í'''''
* {{l|mul|sc=Ital|𐌣}}: canonical - '''''50'''''; Camunic - '''''þ'''''; Faliscan - '''''f'''''
I therefore propose the use of the character which most closely resembles the letterform in a particular language. Therefore South Picene ''matereíh'' should be lemmatize as {{m|spx|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄𐌑𐌇|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄'''𐌑'''𐌇}} and not {{m|spx|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄𐌝𐌇|𐌌𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌓𐌄'''𐌝'''𐌇}}.

For Runic, we make do with [[ᛊ]] or [[ᛋ]], even when the inscription clearly has [[:File:Runic letter sowilo variant.svg|S]]. If Unicode has encoded something as, for example, "LETTER SHE", and we use it in spelling a word which is actually spelled with "LETTER II", I don't see how readers are supposed to figure out that the word isn't spelled with ''she'' (and wonkily transliterated by us).

===Proposal 3:Add extra characters into Ital temporarily===

The interpunct {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}}, two dot punctuation {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}}, and tricolon {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁝}} are all variously used as word separators in <tt>Ital</tt> languages and should be used as punctuation in entries. Furthermore, South Picene (always the culprit) uses {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}} to represent the letter '''''o''''' and {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}} for the letter '''''f'''''. Thus the entry {{m|spx|mefiín}} contains the quotation:
* {{ux|spx|𐌀𐌐𐌀𐌄𐌔⁝𐌒𐌖𐌐𐌀[𐌕?⁝𐌄?]𐌔𐌌𐌑𐌍⁝𐌐𐌞𐌐𐌞𐌍𐌉𐌔⁝𐌍𐌑𐌓⁝'''𐌌𐌄⁚𐌉𐌑𐌍'''⁝𐌅𐌄𐌉𐌀𐌕⁝𐌅𐌄𐌐𐌄𐌕𐌑|translation=The nobleman lies, the chief of the Picenes (?) is (?), '''in the middle''' of the tomb.}}
Until such time as Unicode adds one-, two-, and three-dot word-separators to the <tt>Ital</tt> code block, {{l|mul|sc=Ital|·}} (U+00B7), {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁚}} (U+205A), and {{l|mul|sc=Ital|⁝}} (U+205D) should be used in entries and, in the case of South Picene, in page names ({{m|spx|mefiín}} should be moved to {{m|spx|𐌌𐌄⁚𐌉𐌑𐌍}}).

===Proposal 4:Page names should be in Ital when applicable===

For several of these languages (Old Latin most notably), there may exist a corpus written in the <tt>Latn</tt> alphabet. The majority of the languages exist primarily in their version of the <tt>Ital</tt> alphabet and should be lemmatized as such. It is the scholarly practice to place words transcribed from <tt>Ital</tt> in '''boldface''' and those found in <tt>Latn</tt> in ''italics'' or roman. Where possible, we should strive to put words found in <tt>Ital</tt> or <tt>Latn</tt> according to their appearance in the source. The major offender at this point is Faliscan, the majority of [[:Category:Faliscan lemmas|whose entries]], I suspect, should be in <tt>Ital</tt> (also, {{m|xfa|-el̄u}} shouldn't have a macron in the page name).

== Collapse multiple inflection-of definitions into one with subsenses? ==

I've always been bothered by entries like {{m|la|agri}} and {{m|la|aquae}}. There's no need to repeat "of (word)" four times on separate lines. So I'm thinking it would be good to extend {{temp|inflection of}} so that you can specify distinct multiple inflections instead of just one. These would be displayed as subsenses, so that {{m|la|aquae}} would look like:

# <span class='form-of-definition'>inflections of <span class='form-of-definition-link'><i class="Latn mention" lang="la">[[aqua#Latin|aqua]]</i></span>:</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#nominative_case|nominative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#plural_number|plural]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#genitive_case|genitive]] [[Appendix:Glossary#singular_number|singular]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#dative_case|dative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#singular_number|singular]]</span>
## <span class='form-of-definition'>[[Appendix:Glossary#vocative_case|vocative]] [[Appendix:Glossary#plural_number|plural]]</span>

I think this would look a ''lot'' better, and above all there is only one link to the lemma rather than 3 extra redundant ones. We can also make the list of subsenses collapsible in cases where there's too many (like for German adjectives).

To implement this, {{temp|inflection of}} would need some way to indicate how to separate multiple inflections. This would have to be some kind of special tag that is inserted as a separator, like: {{temp|inflection of|aqua||nom|p|(sep)|gen|s|(sep)|dat|s|(sep)|voc|p|lang{{=}}la}}. My question is what the separator should be. It should be something that isn't legitimately used in existing entries and would not likely be used in future ones. If proposals are made, the current template can be modified to track any uses of those proposed tags in current entries, which would then allow us to assess the situation better. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:20, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

**** Angr is right, quotations and usage examples go on the lemma form. Quotations shouldn't be used merely to attest a term, they exist as a higher-quality alternative to usage examples.

***** No, Angr is wrong about this. We are not simply attesting the term and its usage as a collection of forms, but are cataloging spelling variation, different plural forms, and different inflected forms. While any of these ''can'' be listed at the lemma, it serves no useful purpose whatsoever to ''restrict'' them there. It is much more useful to be able to find supporting citations associated with the specific form of the word, rather than with a lemma form that, in some cases, has been chosen arbrtrarily from among the possible alternatives. If we are showing usage examples, as you say and as I agree, then those need to be placed on the forms pages too. If I want to see how the dative form of a word is used, I want to look at a collection of usages in the dative, not usage of all of the forms together. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 20:51, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
****** Then that certainly goes against the common practice among editors. Editors put usage examples for ''any'' of the inflected forms on the page of the lemma, and have done so since forever. They don't restrict themselves to putting only usage examples for the lemma form on that page. This practice is established enough that some editors will move the usage examples from a non-lemma page to the lemma. A change to this would certainly need further discussion.<br/>If you're looking for usage examples for the dative in a given language, you should not expect to find them in a dictionary under some random word.

****** As CodeCat and Angr have said: citations showing how a term is used go in the lemma entry.

This has been the case for years. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:47, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
******* Argument from what "has been the case for years" (and I will not bother to argue whether this has actually ''been'' the situation or not) is a weak argument that does not address any objective Wiktionary is trying to accomplish. Further, your argument above makes sense only if (1) citations exist ''solely'' for the purpose of demonstrating grammatical usage, and (2) grammtical usage does ''not'' vary with form. But in some languages, the usage of a term may actually ''vary'' with the form of the inflection. As a simple example, the grammar of singular and plural {{l|la|millē}} are very differently in Latin. I would also argue that assuming point (1) is an unnecessary limitation on Wiktionary. Citations exist to document forms and spelling at least equal in measure to documenting proper grammar. To that end, each variant should ideally be (eventually) documented from sources. That cannot be reasonably accomplished if all the various citations are ''limited'' to the lemma page. And CodeCat, no one is suggesting we put the citations under a "random word"; that is a straw man argument. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 00:21, 25 July 2015 (UTC)

== Use "male" and "female" for gendered nouns ==

Many languages have nouns that occur in different forms depending on the natural gender of the referent, like French {{m|fr|comédien}}/{{m|fr|comédienne}}, English {{m|en|actor}}/{{m|en|actress}}. This is not actually grammatical gender the way we know it, exemplified by the fact that languages that have no grammatical gender can still often make such distinctions. Of course grammatical gender may align with natural gender in this case, but it doesn't have to (I can't think of an example, but maybe someone else can). Spanish {{m|es|amiga}} is not a grammatically feminine form of the lemma {{m|es|amigo}}; rather both are independent nouns and have different meanings. The choice is made based on the referent rather than based on grammatical rules.

So I think that using the terms "masculine" and "feminine" and using {{temp|feminine of}} and such for these cases is incorrect and confusing, as it conflates grammatical and natural gender. It's especially bizarre in entries like {{m|en|mayoress}} with languages that don't even have grammatical gender. I'm therefore proposing to introduce the separate terms "male" and "female" to refer to natural gender in these cases. {{m|es|amiga}} is the ''female equivalent'' or ''female counterpart'' of {{m|es|amigo}}, not a ''form''. There would need to be two new form-of templates. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:17, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

: If they are independent nouns then why do we need more templates at all? Define them separately, as e.g. "a man who mows lawns" and "a woman who mows lawns", and each can link to the other as a related term. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 20:20, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: That's not ideal, because they might have many distinct meanings. Duplicating them all would be bad. The idea of a new template is to indicate "this noun means the same as this other one, except referring to a female individual". —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:25, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:I don't agree. The Italian words {{m|it|gato}} and {{m|it|gata}} both mean {{m|en|cat}}. The '''animals''' are make and female, but the '''words''' are masculine and feminine. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 20:22, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: No, {{m|it|gato}} means male/unspecified cat, while {{m|it|gata}} means female cat. And, this is exactly my point. Grammatical gender is arbitrary. "Feminine of gato" tells us nothing; it merely indicates that this noun is related to "gato" but has feminine grammatical gender. Nothing in the entry indicates that the cat itself has to be female, only that the word referring to it is feminine. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:25, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
::: I can think of cases where grammatical gender doesn't match natural gender ({{m|ga|cailín||girl}} is masculine, while {{m|ga|gasóg||boy scout}} and {{m|ga|stail||stallion}} are feminine), but I can't think of a case where a word referring to a person of one gender is derived from a word referring to a person of the other gender, but grammatical and natural genders don't match (in a language that has grammatical gender, unlike English). —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 20:31, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
::: Oh, and if anyone's wondering why {{m|it|gato}} and {{m|it|gata}} are orange links, it's because the Italian words are actually {{m|it|gatto}} and {{m|it|gatta}}. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 20:32, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:::: {{m|it|gatta}}, as it is now, looks good. But as I said above, with highly polysemic words it becomes a problem to copy all the definitions. A simple template that refers to the definitions of the gender-neutral term is more effective. Also, this entry illustrates another important distinction between "feminine of" nouns and adjectives: the female equivalent noun can have meanings the male one doesn't have, or the reverse. With true grammatical gender, like that found in adjectives, that would be unthinkable. They really are separate nouns. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:36, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

:I'll write more later, but at the moment I just want to highlight that the observation that "the female equivalent noun can have meanings the male one doesn't have, or the reverse" calls into question the sensibility of avoiding spelling out which senses each word has and instead using a template that would "indicate 'this noun means the same as this other one, except referring to a female individual'". [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:05, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: You're right about that point. I just wanted to accommodate users who certainly want to use a template, and also existing entries that have no definition beyond {{temp|feminine of}}. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:08, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

:It may be wise to distinguish languages which have grammatical gender from those which do not. Because English does not normally* mark gender grammatically, it's at least debatable whether ''mayoress'' should be described as 'female' or 'feminine'. (The references turned up by {{b.g.c.|English "-ess" "feminine form"}}, compared to the irrelevance turned up by {{b.g.c.|English "-ess" "female form"}}, suggest that the traditional analysis has been that it's a 'feminine' rather than a 'female' form.) *Of course, note how {{b.g.c.|"blonde mayoress"}} gets two hits while "blond mayoress" gets none, and "blonde mayor" gets no hits while "blond mayor" gets at least five (plus a lot of chaff), suggesting that there ''are'' some areas where grammatical gender agreement is found in English.<br>In German and other languages with grammatical gender, the case for describing {{m|de|Wissenschaftlerin}} et al. as 'feminine' rather than 'female' forms of {{m|de|Wissenschaftler}} et al. is necessarily stronger, since they ''are'' feminine, and take feminine adjectives, etc, independent of whether or not they are regarded as 'feminine forms' or 'female forms' of the corresponding masculine nouns. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:26, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
:: One other thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the "female equivalent of X" means "woman is who is an X" but sometimes it means "wife of an X". In the UK at least, a {{m|en|duchess}} is always the wife or widow of a duke; no woman can become duchess by virtue of her birth. Our definition of {{m|de|Burggräfin}} is "female burgrave", but when burgraves were still running around they were always male; a {{m|de|Burggräfin}} is the wife of a burgrave. A hundred years ago or so, {{m|de|Professorin}} almost always meant "wife of a professor" but today it almost always means "female professor". In the {{w|E. F. Benson}} novel ''Trouble for Lucia'', a woman becomes mayor of a town in England and has to choose a {{m|en|mayoress}} to help her, but she is not the mayoress herself—in that context, then, ''mayoress'' means neither "female mayor" nor "wife of the mayor" but rather "woman who assists the mayor". I doubt a single template can or should accommodate all this variation. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 05:56, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
::: Those are excellent points. For words like those, I'm persuaded that we should give the words actual definitions (as Equinox said). For English, almost all of the ''-ess'' and ''-rix'' and other such entries I've seen do have definitions, and we should just clean up the few that don't. For German, the Duden has ''-in'' entries only as pointers to their masculine counterparts, but de.Wikt gives them full definitions, and entries like [[:de:wikt:Professorin]] (which records the different meanings) vs [//www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Professorin Duden: Professorin] (which doesn't acknowledge them) convince me that full definitions are preferable (and, I think, already the norm). That doesn't preclude the existence of entries that would be better handled by a template whose wording could then be debated, but we should probably identify some such entries before debating wording further. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 07:26, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

* I agree with CodeCat that there is a problem with some entries: The current presentation at [[amiga#Spanish]] reads "feminine of amigo, friend", which seems suboptimal since it highlights grammatical properties rather than focusing on the referent. However, I don't agree with CodeCat's solution of using a template. Czech [[učitelka]] says "female teacher", which seems fine to me, and preferable to using a template. Above, Angr makes a good point about duchess: female duke vs. wife of a duke. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:23, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
* I came across another problematic entry, {{m|es|coreana}}. The noun presumably indicates a female person, but there is again nothing in the entry to indicate that. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:38, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

== Language codes ==

2015-07.11 16:30
I'd like to add some language codes for some swedish "dialects" (they should be considered languages IMO) because I don't wanna clutter the swedish entries with tons of dialectal versions, not to mention the dialects have their own grammar and pronounciations and I would like it if I could list those.

The ones I have in mind are Pitemål (Peijtmåle), Lulemål (Leulmale), Överkalixmål (Överkölismale) and Jamtlandic (Jamska).

Don't know what else i'm supposed to say really, Codecat told me to post here about it. {{unsigned|88.83.34.190}}

== Merging ( and ) into a single entry ==

I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to merge entries of separate brackets "[[(]]" and "[[)]]" into matched-pair entries such as "[[()]]" and leaving only single-character entries with definitions about actual uses of a single character without the other, when they exist; when they do not exist the single-character entries could redirect to the matched-pair entries.

Rationale:<br>
1. (repetition) The way it is now, most definitions are repeated: sometimes, the left side sense is "Begins X" and the right side sense is "Ends X". I don't think one should be required to check two separate pages to see definitions for the same thing; also, "begins" and "ends" makes it a bit longer to read, especially when these two words are present in almost all senses in the two pages.

2. (consistency) With two almost identical entries, editing one entry requires editing the other for consistency. I am in the process of updating [[(]] and [[)]] to conform with uses quoted in [[Citations:(]], but that makes it somewhat more cumbersome to keep both entries updated. One example of inconsistency (although easy to be fixed) is that {{unsupported|left curly bracket}} currently has a sense that {{unsupported|right curly bracket}} doesn't.

3. (lexical unit) I'd argue that since in most senses of () you can't use one without the other, they are together only one lexical unit. IMO, having them separated is like having the entry {{unsupported|full stop}} (full stop) with the sense "The first, second, or third dot in an [[ellipsis]], which indicates a pause or omission."

<small>(The reason 4 was added later the same day, 21:44, 12 July 2015 (UTC) - {{revision|33385406|original message linked here}}.)</small><br>
4. (incompleteness) '''[[“]]''' is defined as "Starts a quotation." and '''[[”]]''' is defined as "Ends a quotation." Like a number of other current single-character entries, this seems directed to readers who already know how to use the brackets or quotation marks. (Compare [[―]] (horizontal bar), defined as: "Introduces quoted text.", which from its definition seems exactly synonymous with [[“]] but does not actually require any mark at the end of the text.) If they are merged into [[“”]], then the definition is obviously going to change some way. But if they are kept as separate one-character entries, it would be more accurate to define them as:
: entry for left quotation mark ([[“]]) - "Starts a quotation that ends with ”."
: entry for right quotation mark ([[”]]) - "Ends a quotation that begins with “."

More examples of repeated definitions:<br>
[[(]] - Begins supplemental information.
: ''Sen. John McCain '''('''R., Arizona) spoke at length.''
[[)]] - Ends supplemental information.
: ''Sen. John McCain (R., Arizona''')''' spoke at length.''

Some affected entries:
* [[()]] = [[(]] + [[)]]
* [] [[Unsupported titles/Square brackets]] = [[Unsupported titles/Left square bracket]] + [[Unsupported titles/Right square bracket]]
* {} [[Unsupported titles/Curly brackets]] = [[Unsupported titles/Left curly bracket]] + [[Unsupported titles/Right curly bracket]]
* [[“”]] = [[“]][[”]]
* [[‘’]] = [[‘]][[’]]
* [[⟨⟩]] = [[⟨]][[⟩]]
* [[«»]] = [[«]][[»]]
* Other brackets: [[〔 ]][[〕]], [[「 ]][[」]], [[【 ]][[】]].
* Also possibly for Spanish: [[¿?]] = [[¿]][[?]]; [[¡!]] = [[¡]][[!]]

Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:45, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

* Yes, please. Though I would prefer a title of [[[[( ... )]]]] to avoid the impression that "()" appears in texts without anything in between, and because the ellipsis also lends itself well to phrases that are otherwise hard to lemmatise (e.g. {{m|en|I'm ... year(s) old}}). <span class="signature">— [[User:Kephir|Keφr]]</span> 09:49, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' [[’]], at least is not usually a paired character. [[”]] is also used as an unpaired character. Even when not used as apostrophes or transliteration characters, what pairs of quotes there are and what order they come in is language-dependent; to turn [[«]] and [[»]] into [[«»]], [[»«]] and [[»»]], as [[w:Guillemet]] says is necessary, is not a win.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 10:58, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
** I have never seen an unpaired use of [[”]]; I have seen [[″]], however.

*** And quotes, which come in various directions. Why not just a {{temp|paired with}} template instead of physically merging the pages.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 21:42, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

***** Because it's not as neat as [[a- -ing]]. Because quotes stand alone at the starts of lines to mark continued quotes in older books; because quotes are used in different pairs in different languages and different time periods. Because many quotes, whether or not you've seen them, have been used for non-quote purposes. The braces and parenthesis can probably justifiably be put together, at least I haven't seen an exception, but the quotes are much more complex across all writing then just simple standardized matched pairs.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 23:47, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
***** For example, [[“]] says "starts a quotation". That's incomplete; it also ends a quotation, as per [[w:Quotation mark]]. It can be matched up with several others.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 23:52, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
****** If we create entries for every combination in [[w:Quotation mark#Summary table for all languages]], then we would have these, as long as they are attestable: (using the format with space in the middle) [[“ ”]], [[„ “]], [[„ ”]], [[‘ ’]], [[‚ ’]], [[« »]], [[" "]], [[‹ ›]], [[» «]], [[› ‹]] and [[» »]]. I propose creating all the matched-pairs (11 entries don't look like too many, unless I'm missing something?) while leaving the single-characters with indexes to the matched-pairs. If we decide to do the opposite, e.g. keep only single-character entries and thus not create any of those matched-pairs, then the single characters would still need to have accurate indices of all formats of all language(s) either way. As an aside: [[「 」]] and [[『 』]] are fine to me, but I don't know exactly what to do with vertical brackets, I wonder if they could be treated as single-character exceptions until further discussion: [[﹃]] [[﹄]] and [[﹁]] [[﹂]]. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 00:28, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

:The merger seems like a good idea, as the matched-pair usage is, in a sense not SoP, but it is probably also true that we can find attestation of the use of each character in isolation and, just as in the case of the morphemes that make up a compound, we would probably want to keep separate entries, even if there were no attestation apart from the matched-pair use.
:We would in any event need to have hard redirects from the unmatched characters to the corresponding matched-pair entry. If we go the route of extensive hard (and soft) redirects, then the objection that no normal person would ever search for [[[[( ... )]]]] becomes moot.

* I'm adding now the 4th bullet point of the rationale in my first message above; please see it. Concerning the page name, IMO I was thinking of adding a space in the page name, like this: [[( )]], [[« »]], [[¿ ?]], etc. Although I still see much merit in the spaceless [[()]], [[«»]], [[¿?]], etc. I don't like [[( ... )]], particularly the fact that it's more difficult to type; though entries like this certainly would be linkable or redirected from their single-character parts. I am worried about [[']] and [["]]; spaceless matched-pair entries for these two would be [['']] and [[""]]; these look too ugly and [['']] (two apostrophes) looks identical to [["]] (one quotation mark) to me. I think the same with space ([[' ']] and [[" "]]) is great. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:44, 12 July 2015 (UTC)

In accordance with this proposal, or to test it a little to see if it looks good, I created 18 new entries for most of the variations of quotation marks listed in [[w:Quotation mark]]. I chose to link to and from all single-characters rather than using redirects. This improves our coverage since our entries didn't mention all these varieties before. Having separate entries is also an opportunity to explain better how they are used in each language. IMO, just having the entry [[”]] with "Ends a quotation." is worthless if we can write the quotation marks as many ways as '''[[“ ”]]''', '''[[” ”]]''' or '''[[„ ”]]'''.

See '''{{revision|33350344|this link}}''', it is very interesting. It is the previous version of the entry '''“''' with a translation table of 33 languages - just the ''starting'' quotation mark in each one, no mention of how to end the quotation, which I find confusing and annoying since you had to go to the other page to see how the quotation mark ends — sure enough, '''{{revision|25627574|this other link}}''' is '''”''' also with a translation table under the same circumstances, except with only 30 languages. If you saw the first table and discovered that Hungarian and Romanian apparently start quotations with '''„''' and Swedish starts them with '''”''', the second table won't help you to know how they end. Apparently this was intentional — since all these three seemingly end with '''”''', putting this information on the table would not be a "translation". Anyway, I deleted both tables and replaced them with one of my own. ({{temp|quotation marks}})

Also, {{user|Dan Polansky}} requested: "I request that pages [[(]] and [[)]] are left as they were at the start of this discussion for at least three days after the start of the discussion." While I did not touch the parentheses specifically yet, I've intentionally done as he said since the discussion started on July 12 and I edited the entries of quotation marks on July 16.

New entries:

* Curved double quotation marks: '''[[“ ”]]''', '''[[” ”]]''', '''[[„ ”]]''', '''[[„ “]]'''
* Curved single quotation marks: '''[[‘ ’]]''', '''[[’ ’]]''', '''[[‚ ’]]''', '''[[‚ ‘]]''', '''[[’ ‘]]'''
* Straight quotation marks: '''[[" "]]'''
* Apostrophes: '''[[' ']]'''
* Guillemets: '''[[« »]]''', '''[[» «]]''', '''[[» »]]'''
* Single guillemets: '''[[‹ ›]]''', '''[[› ‹]]'''
* Corner brackets: '''[[「 」]]''', '''[[『 』]]'''

Thoughts? Is it just me or do other people think they look good too? Do people think it was a waste of time and that the new entries should all be deleted? (I acknowledge some people here opposed the proposal, others supported it.)

I mostly just copied Wikipedia as I don't speak all those languages, and I used only minimal definitions for each entry. If there's any mistake in the entries or the table feel free to fix it, also expand the entries if you like. If it's alright, I'd like to do the same for [[( )]], square brackets, [[¿ ?]], etc. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:16, 16 July 2015 (UTC)

* '''Oppose''' proposed merge of [[(]] and [[)]] on the grounds that each is susceptible to unique senses.

# {{oppose}} Harder to type. Even if we have redirects from [[( )]] and [[()]] to [[( … )]], most people would try to type the entry name with ellipsis anyway before figuring out the redirects, since the name with ellipsis would be the actual entry name. Redirects would not be intuitive unless we start adding the {{temp|shortcut}} template to entries. I've created {{unsupported|square bracketed ellipsis}} as an example of entry which has the ellipsis as part of the entry name, not as an indication that it is a blank space to be filled. Having [ … ] simultaneously with that entry would require some additional explanation of what is a space to be filled and what is an actual ellipsis. Just like with the [[:Category:English circumfixes|English circumfixes]], I don't think the ellipsis is necessary to demonstrate that the space between parentheses is a blank to be filled, because: 1) in the case of parentheses and other common English symbols, most readers probably already know how they are positioned in relation to the text anyway; but 2) especially in the case of unknown and FL brackets, the definitions should explain this satisfactorily; even a simple phrase like "Encloses supplemental information." at [[( )]] is good enough IMO, especially when together with examples, and perhaps usage notes when needed. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 11:28, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

==FL example sentences==

There seems to be a great deal of inconsistency in the formatting of example sentences under foreign language entries. I've been reformatting them as I come across them, but it's a lot of work, and I'm not sure if there are any accepted formats besides the one given in the guidelines. Speaking of which:

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.''
#:: Here is an example.

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.''
#:: Here is an '''example'''.

Both of the above are considered correct according to WT:ELE, and both are common. Is one preferred over the other, or are both in equal use and equally allowed?

Now, here are some formats of FL examples that I've come across frequently for Spanish sentences (but with often missing punctuation included):

# (''Definition.'')
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' - Here is an example.
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' — “Here is an example.”
#: ''Voici un '''exemple'''.'' -- Here is an '''example'''.

There are others, but the above seem to be especially widespread (at least in Spanish entries), and at least some are being included in new definitions. Should I just leave them alone, or fix them as I see them? Is it possible to fix something like that with a bot?

== Persistent extensions of votes ==

I consider these numerous persistent extensions (in summa: 4 with [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary%3AVotes%2Fpl-2014-07%2FAllowing_well-attested_romanizations_of_Sanskrit&type=revision&diff=33283124&oldid=33282977 a fifth attempt] thwarted; I find the præsence of the adjective fair in this fifth attempt maladroit) of [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-07/Allowing_well-attested_romanizations_of_Sanskrit|a single vote]] truly inappropriate or at least disconcerting. I would like to clarify that currently this not a critical remark regarding the vote’s closing or outcome, instead I would like to discountenance said adjustment ''ad libitum'' of the expiration date of that already protracted vote with the aim to impede an outcome that at the time of the second extension (beginning of April) was an evident lack of consensus (7-6). Actually this had been mine initial motivation for participating in the vote: the desire to contribute with one more vote to the manifestness of the rejection and hopefully præcipitate the closure of that vote.<br />To me, there is no reasonable justification for extending any vote more that one month (to put it simply or to appeal to æsthetics: those numerous struck extensions encumber the mere lecture of the vote’s content), or at most one and a half months, but I would be interested to heed to others’ suggestions (if any arise) for a temporal limitation in that sense in order to præclude future unconfined extensions.

: If, instead of respecting the deadline, we repeatedly move it ahead until such time as we happen to have a sufficient number of voters to call it a consensus (which 12–6 isn't really, but let's ignore that arguendo), then we're favoring view of such latecomers as happen to come across the vote first, a [[w:selection bias|selection bias]]. If we believe that a longer time is necessary or desired, then (0) that longer time should be set when first proposing the vote and not extended. And if that realization comes post facto, then, ideally, (1) call it no consensus, discuss and advertise the issue better in the BP and perhaps elsewhere, and start a new and better vote, if desired. Or, at least, (2) we should have a limit of one extension on a vote. Or, at the very least, (3) we should extend a vote as long again after consensus is achieved as we did before it was (and as long again after it's achieved in the opposite direction, if that happens).

:::::::::::::I don't think I ever said that individuals were corrupt, only that the process was. In any event, that is what I intended and I stand by that. I'd favor other people closing votes rather than me as I can't figure out how the archiving is suppose to go, but I closed a few votes that had run their appointed term. 
:::::::::::::Judging by the low participation, I wonder why we give any force at all to the outcome of some votes. If we can't muster a quorum (6, 7, 8, 10?; counting abstainers?; differing for various classes of votes (bot status, admin votes, substantive?), then there should be no mandatory policy resulting from the vote. Votes probably need to be more publicized. The subpage structure interferes with achieving comprehensive coverage of votes. Would Editor news be good for that or BP? Do we need a tickler system (a single page?) of some kind to remind folks when a vote starts, when it is about to end, when and how it was decided?

::::::::::::Your accusing me of making my suggestion "so that [I] can beat the bushes to scare up enough votes to win the opposite decision" is inappropriate and insulting. First of all, I mentioned above that I mind the procedure followed not the decision itself. Second, even if I disagreed with the decision substantively, that'd be a groundless accusation. You're right that the vote has been called. Arguably, it's been called inappropriately. Can't people contest the closure on the vote page and see if consensus builds there to let it stand closed or not, without holding a new vote on the issue, and with the burden on those who wish to reopen it (viz so that, if no consensus builds at all, the vote stays closed)? In my opinion yes.<span class="Unicode">&#x200b;—[[User:Msh210|msh210]]℠</span> ([[user talk:Msh210|talk]]) 05:03, 16 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::: @[[User:Msh210|msh210]]: I don't think the initially set end date of the vote is a ''deadline'', and that our ''procedure'' is to ''forbid'' extending a vote. That would be ''another procedure'', not the one that we have. In fact, we do not have a specified procedure as for the meaning of the end date of the vote, merely the common practice. And the common practice is to allow extensions of a vote, as was done e.g. in [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-05/Placenames with linguistic information 2]]; if anyone is interested, I can collect all votes that were ever extended. My extending this particular vote was driven by the same tentative unspoken principles I was using in previous votes that I have extended.

* Repeated extensions of votes are a great thing. People are slow to come to votes. There is nothing unethical about extending votes, nothing that I was able to discover when I investigated the question. There is very little opportunity for the extender to use selection bias. You cannot on any vote just wait until 2/3 supermajority happens; most votes do not create that opportunity. In any vote in which waiting until 2/3 worked, there was in fact a lot more support than opposition. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:03, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

This practice can be objected to, but it is not like [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-07/Allowing well-attested romanizations of Sanskrit]] is the first or second vote to use that practice. During the multiple extensions of the vote, there was ample opportunity for those who deem the practice "corrupt" to speak their mind on this issue, on the vote talk page, in Beer parlour or elsewhere. Obviously, I do not consider the practice "corrupt". Nonetheless, by my principles, [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-07/Allowing well-attested romanizations of Sanskrit]] should be extended by one month; it should not be voided. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:42, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

== Deletion of good faith edits with no explanation ==

I have been a very sporadic contributor to Wiktionary for a number of years. Sometimes I have little bursts of activity, and then sometimes long gaps of inactivity. One of the things that repeatedly drives me away just when I might be getting enthusiastic about joining the project is the unexplained deletion of added content, such as happened [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=marigold&diff=33413519&oldid=33412790 here]. This comes across as extremely rude and hostile. I understand that a lot of vandalism and nonsense has to be reverted, and I understand that mistakes are sometimes made. However, this has happened to me too often, and mostly (as far as I recall) from certain editors, for it to always be a mistake. I think instead it is a cultural problem here amongst certain members that the community would do well to address. [[Special:Contributions/109.153.244.21|109.153.244.21]] 20:56, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

== Italicizing the entry name of taxonomic names ==

I am just announcing an edit I made, since I was thinking about it for a while and decided to just do it today without discussing beforehand.

I made {{temp|taxoninfl}} italicise the entry title of all entries for taxonomic names that use this template, so that:

* [[Acer rubrum]]'s title is ''Acer rubrum''
* [[Gorilla gorilla]]'s title is ''Gorilla gorilla''
* etc.

--[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:14, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

: Not good, because, unlike [[genus|genera]], [[family|families]] should not be italicised. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 18:16, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

:: Sorry about that. Based on your comment, I've changed the template further to italicize the entry name only when <code>i=1</code>, just like the headword line. That way, ''[[Homo]]'' is italicized while [[Hominidae]] isn't. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:29, 17 July 2015 (UTC)

:::And that conflicts with the German use of [[Homo]]. Maybe I should just undo the change and leave all the affected entries without italics like they were? That said, the italicized name looks good on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', ''[[Acer rubrum]]'', etc. and all the species names, though. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:32, 17 July 2015 (UTC)
::::There's no good reason to have a pl parameter. All taxa are proper nouns. At rank of genus or lower they have the form of a singular Latin noun. At ranks higher than genus they have the form of a plural Latin noun. That is more or less part of the prescribed "grammar" of such names. Plural forms of generic and subgeneric rank taxa are not, strictly speaking part of the taxonomic name system. One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded. It would be interesting to see whether they appeared in New Latin genus and species descriptions, but arguably they would then be Latin.

One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded." In the past, before I started editing [[Homo sapiens]] and [[Homines sapientes]] for a number of different reasons, there were English sections, an (odd) translation table and pronunciations; I moved all the applicable information into Translingual. Personally, I'd rather keep them that way, even if other entries for declensions of homo+sapiens are attestable ([[Hominis sapientis]]? [[Homini sapienti]]?), especially if those are found in running text in multiple languages. But it would be understandable if you and/or other people wanted to use different language sections for those like we do for CJK languages. You said the plurals are not strictly part of the system, for this reason I apologize since the current format with pl= makes it seem like the plurals really are part of the system. I propose keeping the plurals Translingual, at least until further discussion, while linking from the singular forms as Derived terms or the like, if you'd agree with that. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 20:18, 17 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::{{reply to|Daniel Carrero}} Why bother for two instances? I would have thought that {{temp|mul-proper noun}} (which is not deprecated, just not my preference for taxonomic names) was perfect for that. Furthermore it is difficult for me to accept that plural and genitive forms ''are'' taxonomic names. The citations indicate that the terms are being used as plural for members of the group ''Homo spaiens'', not for plurals of the group. Every taxonomic name is of a group, not of its members. One great advantage of limiting the use of {{temp|taxoninfl}} to taxonomic names is that it can be used to identify taxonomic entries that are lemmas. Remember that the heterogeneity of Translingual makes the idea of a single class of Translingual lemmas useless for most practical purposes.

::::::::{{reply to|DCDuring}} You are most involved with entries for taxonomic names and I edit them only occasionally. I have the feeling I'm probably going to [[fold]] and revert quick if you say I've done something wrong with the templates or the entries. Still, there's a point I would like to discuss. About: "Every taxonomic name is of a group, not of its members." as well as "Plural forms of generic and subgeneric rank taxa are not, strictly speaking part of the taxonomic name system. One could consider them to be borrowings into whatever language they are embedded." Wiktionary is a descriptive dictionary. Even if taxonomic names are intended to be used as proper nouns representing entire groups, while this should be respected and informed in the entries, I'd argue that their separate usage as nouns is nothing special. Just like you can say: "I've found a member of ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''!", you could say "I've found a ''Vulpes vulpes''!" and find plenty of citations of "noun" versions of taxonomic names like this in multiple languages. IMO, cited uses like this don't constitute a reason for having separate sections other than Translingual for any languages, let alone a great number of language sections just for cited noun senses for a given entry as they are found, especially if any plurals attested use the rules of Latin grammar in multiple languages. I'm not sure if we could have Translingual noun senses along with proper noun senses, or maybe not? My point is just that it does not seem to merit separate language sections just for this. What do you think? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 01:17, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::I don't think that the way people use them is the same in every language and I have no idea how to get that information. I'm not even going to do it in English. What authoritative resource would we use for that? It I can't imagine doing the attestation. I'm not going to beat my brains out to incorporate relatively subtle variations which most users won't even notice. Our dictionary is rife with omission of much less subtle information in areas that are know to cause English language learners problems: ambiguous, erroneous, and misleading use of determiners in our definitions and failure to provide basic grammatical information ((un)countability), (in)transitivity, complements) come to mind. 
:::::::::In any event we would have to document the usage of taxonomic names in the communities that use them most. A very small share of taxonomic names even have vernacular-language homonyms that correspond to the taxa and we have entries for some of those, especially in horticulture, eg.

::::::::::Daniel is right, though: while the authorities may prescribe that the names be used only for "the group X", many of them are well attested in multiple languages as terms for "a member of the group X", which can be used with the indefinite article and in the plural (see e.g. [[Citations:Homo sapiens]], and {{b.g.c.|"un Homo sapiens"}}). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 03:37, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::I would think it more useful to have note on how folks borrow taxonomic terms into each language in general than to lexicalize a million or even a hundred instances of such borrowing. 
:::::::::::All someone has to do is attest the pattern of usage (capitalization, pluralization, and other inflections in some languages) for each language in which the Translingual term is borrowed and used. I don't see any way around it. Today I looked at plurals of ''Virus''. In some germanic languages the plural is ''Virusen''. I don't think that belongs in Translingual as it reflects a pattern specific to at most a group of languages.
:::::::::::I certainly won't protest if someone chooses to do all of that, but I am more interested in having Translingual entries for purposes of disambiguating vernacular names; helping folks read scientific literature by providing etymology, pictures, and translations; and even providing gender to help folks with naming species. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  04:03, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::A language-specific plural is evidence that the Latin/Translingual term has been borrowed into another language. (Jumi Vogler, ''Was der Humor für Sie tun kann, wenn in Ihrem Leben mal ...'', 2014, page 20, has this example of {{m|de|Eindeutschung}}: Zumal damals das Warenangebot an '''Homo sapiensen''' noch relativ klein war.) If a Latinate plural, however, is used in as many languages as a Latinate singular, I don't see how only one of them could be excluded from the Translingual section short of saying "we copy what the authorities prescribe on this matter", which doesn't comport with descriptivism. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Homo_sapiens&type=revision&diff=33584730&oldid=33558223 Here]'s one way such information could be presented (note not only my added sense and usage note, but the plural which is already provided). If one wanted to weigh the scales a bit in favour of prescriptivism, one could even confine both things to the usage note, i.e. not add a second sense-line nor a plural to the headword-line, but mention both in the usage note. <br>I suppose if the 2 or 3 entries which currently have plurals are the only ones that pluralize and/or are used with the indefinite article to refer to members of a group / species / etc, and they only do so in 5 or 6 languages, one could argue it's easier to add 18 different language sections than to expand 3 Translingual sections... but if more entries than that pluralize, it becomes untenable, IMO, to require a myriad of different language sections rather than expand the Translingual section.

:I won't invoke our slogan. Wikispecies generally does not bother with obsolete taxa or with the gender and etymology of any taxa. (Few other taxonomic databases bother with gender and etymology either.) They also do not always have entries that correspond to well-attested vernacular names including those we already have, which is the purpose of the lists at [[User:DCDuring/MissingTaxa]]. Wikipedia doesn't bother with gender and is very uneven about covering etymology and obsolete taxa. 
:That we don't provide pronunciations or translations of taxa is a result of our decisions, not whether such would be useful to users. Our decision about translations is apparently based on the perceived need to reflect how native speakers of various languages actually pronounce the taxon, not how it ''ought'' to be pronounced, though that is what users seem to want. Our decision not to have translations seems as much to be that a vernacular name could be viewed as a monolingual synonym, as a translation, or as a term identifying members of the group named by the taxon, so we didn't want to depart from the gem-like precision of our conceptual model of language to include them.

::# For a long time, a single sysop ran the entire operation his way, 24/7, overruling anyone else making edits there. A lot of animosity developed between this sysop, other sysops, and some other wiki projects. That user has since been banned, but this also means that style and content are a bit unstable as the community finds its footing again.
::# Wikispecies goes in heavy for sourcing the publication, description, revision, and circumscription of taxa. This often has no bearing on the use of the word, but is of vital importance to researchers.
::# Wikispecies has a highly navigable taxonomic tree built into every entry, such that taxonomic changes can be easily implemented without having to re-edit every affected entry.
::# Commons links to Wikispecies whenever there is an entry to match a Commons category. Some Wikipedias (such as fr) also build in a link to Wikispecies from their taxoboxes. This isn't universal, though, in either direction, in part because the classification systems in use at different Wikipedias does not always match.
::# Further, since Wikidata now controls interwiki links between the Wikipedias, the link situation has deteriorated. The editing of interwiki links between botanical taxa, for example, is under the control and supervision of User:Brya, who has been banned here, at the English Wikipedia, and at the Dutch Wiktionary and Wikipedia, for contentious edits, sockpuppetry, and a number of other problems. Her idiosyncratic ideas have led to a fragmentation of data items on Wikidata so that identical circumscriptions of taxa given different names, attributions, or rank on different Wikipedias are no longer interlinked. And links will only exist if ''everything'' about the taxa match ''exactly'' (and even then I've come across baffling counterexmaples).
:: So, we're a long way from useful interlinking between taxon entries on different projects. It is therefore difficult to avoid or streamline any duplication of content or redundancy of data. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 21:11, 24 July 2015 (UTC)

Can someone please undo the recent edits of {{temp|cs-noun}} to provide for pseudo-genders m-an and m-in. They are intended to mark "an" for "animate" and "in" for inanimate.

I think rather than asking for undoing this change, if you really object to the general concept of having "gender" include "pseudo-genders" then you should (a) propose an alternative, (b) open a more general discussion about how to handle this.

== Normalization of entries 2 ==

[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries]] failed. See also at the end of the vote [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries#Decision|my comments]] about the result of the vote, which I'm cool with, since the affected policy is still imperfect. The vote proposed having [[Wiktionary:Normalization of entries]] ([[WT:NORM]]) as an official policy alongside [[WT:CFI]] and [[WT:ELE]]. [[WT:NORM]] deals with aspects of formatting that are invisible to the user but are expected to be standardized nonetheless, such as whitespaces, spaces between == ==, the placement of interwikis at the end of the page and the placement of categories at the end of the language section.

The list of items currently in the policy was developed from [[User talk:Connel MacKenzie/Normalization of articles|this extensive 2006 thread]], which shaped the wiki code of our entries as we know to this date with the major role of [[User:AutoFormat]] (2007–2010) and I proposed to be officialized through [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Voting on normalization of entries|this discussion from May 2015 with 13 polls]]. Controversial, outdated or undiscussed items were removed from the list and moved to [[Wiktionary talk:Normalization of entries#Removed items|here]]. Continuing from where the previous discussion left off, I thought of 2 more polls to address issues that were raised in the vote. I feel it's a good idea to keep asking questions until the policy is just right. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]])

----

===Poll 14===
<s>Proposal:<br>
Having [[WT:NORM]] only with rules that affect the wiki code of the entry and are invisible to the readers.<br>
Rationale:<br>
Currently, most rules listed in [[WT:NORM]] are invisible, (such as whitespace, line breaks, spaces between == ==, spaces after * and interwikis at the end of the list), so it does not matter if the rules are followed or not by editors, the page would look the same to readers. If there are any rules that affect the layout of the pages, they should be kept in [[WT:ELE]], not [[WT:NORM]]. Use the comments of this poll to discuss exactly rules can be affected by this poll.</s>

'''Comments'''
<!-- Enter comments here. -->
<br>I believe the rules that exist in the current version of [[WT:NORM]] and can be removed for affecting the layout of the entries are, specifically:
* Language names should not be linked
* Translation sections: Markup such as gender should be provided within the {{temp|t}}/{{temp|t+}} template, except for qualifiers, which should use {{temp|qualifier}}
* ---- before each language heading except the first
--[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:04, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
* Hi Daniel. I'm unclear as to what you mean exactly by "invisible to the reader". Can you spell out which rules aren't invisible? As I mentioned, I had two objections. One concerns the insistence that categories need to be put at the end of the language section instead of at the end of an etymology subsection; I assume this is "invisible to the reader"? The other is about only one headword line per section, which simply doesn't work well for some Arabic entries. I assume this is "visible to the reader"? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:14, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
*: Hi Benwing. After you sent this message, since no one besides myself had voted for this poll yet, I've changed the whole text of the poll; maybe it does look clearer now? 
*:After you gave your reasons for opposing both rules of "only one headword line per section" and "categories need to be put at the end of the language section", I simply removed them from [[WT:NORM]] and added them to [[Wiktionary_talk:Normalization_of_entries#Removed_items]] until further discussion. But, since following these rules does affect how the entry look like to readers, I'd say these are "visible" rules and thus I don't think they should be applicable in [[WT:NORM]] anyway. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:35, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
*::I'm striking this poll. I edited [[WT:NORM]] so that all rules of this policy concern whitespace, blank lines, etc. and removed everything else that changes the layout of the entry, thus is "visible" to the reader of the entry. I don't think there's any reason to leave any rules at [[WT:NORM]] if they can be placed in [[WT:ELE]] instead. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 17:48, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

====Poll 16 - Comments====
<!-- Enter comments here. -->

Rather than having support/oppose/abstain options, I would like to discuss what looks better in each case.

Personally, my opinions are:
* Yes - I believe it's especially important that we do insert a blank line between the image and a new section that follows below the image (===Noun===, for example), because if there were no image, a blank line would precede the new section anyway.
* No - don't insert a blank line between the image and a headword template. (in cases where the image is between ===Noun=== and {{temp|en-noun}}, for example, just don't insert a blank line anywhere) That because, in my mind, the headword template is sort of the extension of the POS heading.
* In all other cases, I'd probably be fine either way, but I'm leaning towards: yes, have the space in all situations, it looks better and a bit easier to read, by properly separating one type of content from the other.
Thoughts? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 12:53, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

*Don't the added spaces in some cases change the appearance that results? [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  19:20, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
** {{ping|DCDuring}} No, not that I'm aware of. I tested both versions of the whole code that I used as an example for this poll and the presence or lack of spaces did not change anything in the appearance of the entry. In addition, the [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Poll 6|poll 6]] from May 2015 was specifically about having a image or a {{temp|wikipedia}} box between two headings. In that poll, I addressed a similar question about spaces changing the appearance of the page. My reply was: "[E]xtra vertical space only appears if we use a broken template with extra newlines at the end of the code before <nowiki><includeonly/></nowiki>, I presume? [...]" and I mentioned [[five second rule]] and [[feminism]] as two entries which use images with spacing without breaking anything. Also, the results of the poll I mentioned were 0-6-0-2, meaning 6 votes supporting the spacing, no votes supporting the space-less version; no opposes and 2 abstains. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 19:42, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

== Uncommon and exotic words in Translations section ==

Someone added German ''Weltnetz'' and ''Zwischennetz'' to the "Translations" section of [[Internet]]: see {{diff|33582517}}.
These words are hardly used, and the usual German word for ''Internet'' is simply ''Internet''.
The presence of these words in the "Translations" section suggests that they are normal German translations of the English term ''Internet''.

What should one do with them?
* Delete them? As English to German translations they are useless and misleading.
* Add labels? Such as ''hardly used''?

[[Wiktionary:Translations]] doesn't say much about this problem.

== ISBN - request for more opinions ==

There is a discussion at [[Wiktionary talk:About Czech#Rejzek 2015]] whether an ISBN parameter can stay in the reference template {{template|R:Rejzek 2015}} or whether it should be removed. After several reverts were made at the template I would like to ask the community for more opinions to decide the issue. Thanks. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 17:28, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
: My reasoning, for a Beer parlour discussion: ISBN is visual noise, and makes the user experience worse for people like me. It is inessential for identification. It is inessential for search purposes. It is not used in the references sections of multiple English books that I own and that I checked. I prefer that the use of ISBN in reference templates is avoided. I also prefer that it is avoided in attesting quotations, but that is less urgent since these are hidden in the mainspace by default. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 18:53, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
: What we could do is create an appendix with references. The reference template would link to a location in the appendix, like Appendix:References#Rejzek_2015. That location would provide more extensive information, including the ISBN, and maybe multiple relevant searches, and links related to the reference, including one to Wikipedia. Book identifiers other than ISBN could be provided as well, if wished. Thus, we could keep the appearance of the reference template in the mainspace short and simple, while providing extensive detail to those readers who need or want it. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:22, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
: An ISBN uniquely identifies a particular book, in theory and usually in practice.

As Dan Polansky points out, one can type in http://www.google.com/search?q=2015+%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD+etymologick%C3%BD+slovn%C3%ADk+Rejzek; or as I point out, one can click on the ISBN which Wikimedia helpfully links to various book sites, no guessing what values to feed into Google.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 23:37, 19 July 2015 (UTC)

:::I, too, think Equinox's idea is grand, but the link text probably should be something other than "ISBN".

:::The ISBN is overly specific in that it specifies particular stock-keeping units for book retailers, not specific texts, which may be available in multiple ISBNs. 
:::It is the display of "ISBN" followed by the ISBN number that is my core problem. Can we not have less clutter while achieving the same link as a result? 
:::I would much prefer that we standardize on the display of desired links, of which I can think only of two at the moment. The more desirable of the two is a link to a particular page of the reference work (or database) available online. The second is the special:booksources link.

Wikipedia even has a page [[w:WP:I just don't like it]] suggesting that such argumentation should be avoided. So can we really take a vote seriously if everyone is just voting for preference without substantiating anything? For political voting that works, but not for a community based on consensus. We have no coalition and opposition here, nor should we. If each side just uses "I don't like it" to the other side, that isn't consensus, that's just tyranny of the majority and grudging acceptance by the minority. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:53, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

:: A user who favoured the passage of the vote didn't mind extending it repeatedly for as long as it took to obtain the appearance of a majority in favour of the vote, but now objects to extending the vote any further than that because he thinks the further extension will result in it being clear that there isn't a (passage-sufficient) majority in favour of the proposal after all. And he suggests changing the customary threshold for passage or disqualifying "oppose" votes so that the vote could still pass without consensus. Hmm... can you see why people are suspicious of the legitimacy of the vote? In the past (for years, ''vide'' [[Wiktionary:Votes/Timeline]]), when a vote showed that there was no consensus for something, the vote was closed at the scheduled time as "no consensus" (or simply as "fails", because votes require consensus to pass).

[[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:05, 22 July 2015 (UTC)

:: I purposefully left sign languages out of the LDL because they have their own rules for inclusion as shown in the CFI, which references the sign CFI [[Wiktionary:About sign languages]]. 
:: The sign language CFI says: 'Unlike spoken languages, sign languages are rarely written outside of reference materials and academic publications. Thus, the "clearly widespread use" condition of Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion (CFI) is considered to be met by any sign that is used by multiple independent deaf communities, and the "usage in permanently recorded media" condition includes any visual media that has been widely distributed, including DVDs, broadcast television, and sign language dictionaries.' I have not been active on Wiktionary for some time, so I might be out of date, but I would not be in favor of adding sign languages to the LDL. 
:: As to Angr's point about natural languages, the CFI page includes a link to [[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion/Well_documented_languages]] which specifically notes that only approved constructed languages are acceptable. 
:: A very picky follow-up WRT to Angr's point. The number of citations requirement says: "For languages well documented on the Internet, three citations in which a term is used is the minimum number for inclusion in Wiktionary. For terms in extinct languages, one use in a contemporaneous source is the minimum, or one mention is adequate subject to the below requirements. For all other spoken languages that are living, only one use or mention is adequate, subject to the following requirements:" Somebody might argue that a spoken, living constructed language that is not in the list of "languages well documented on the Internet" therefore requires only one use or mention. However, constructed languages are specifically addressed later on the page, so I don't think this is an issue of concern. -[[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BB12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 00:31, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

He would have said it was all about improving the entries, too.
:: Now, to the merits: there are reasons for the current transliteration scheme that have nothing to do with anyone being dropped on their head when they were little. [[X]] is open to confusion: not only does it look like [[χ]], but it's been used to represent it, for instance in {{w|beta code}}. There's no doubt about what "ks" represents. It's also a matter of being consistent in using digraphs for both the consonant + s series and the aspirated consonant series. Your way has merit, but it's not the only way that makes sense.

:: {{ping|LlywelynII}} please note that it took a single edit to change not just the entry you were screaming bloody murder over, but every single entry that uses a template to link to any Ancient Greek word with that letter in it anywhere on Wiktionary, and every link using the templates that will ever be added to Wiktionary as long as the module is in its current state.

* One should not be confused about the status quo ante at [[Module:grc-translit]], which was created on 8 September 2013 by [[User:ZxxZxxZ]]. The decisive thing should be the status quo in the manually entered transliterations that were used in Ancient Greek entries before the module was created. I recall [[User:Atelaes]] had some cards in Ancient Greek transliteration. I don't have enough energy to do this, but someone should investigate what the mainspace transliteration was back then, and then either keep the -sche change to the module or revert it as not yet supported by consensus. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:53, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

== Derivation categories for multiple homonymous morphemes ==

Many languages have morphemes that are spelled and/or pronounced the same, but have different origins and different uses. An example is the English {{m|en|-er}}: it has a variety of unrelated uses. Currently, {{temp|suffix}}, {{temp|affix}} and family would put words in the same category even if they are derived from different underlying suffixes. Consequently, the categories are a bit of a mess, just see [[:Category:English words suffixed with -er]]. The same is now also happening with PIE root categories; some roots are actually two distinct but homonymic roots, and it's necessary to distinguish which of them a word came from. I think this should be fixed somehow, but I'm not sure in what way. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:24, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
: Perhaps we could put a disambiguation suffix on the category names so that different homonyms go to different categories (maybe <nowiki>[[Category:English words suffixed with -er/2]] or [[Category:English words suffixed with -er:2]]</nowiki>?). That would require adding a parameter to the affix templates to specify the disambiguator. It would also require adding the same parameter to the catboilers so they could accommodate the suffixes. The catboilers would need to add the unsuffixed category so the suffixed categories would show up as subcategories in the unsuffixed categories. It would also be a good idea to add a parameter for a sense ID or similar anchor to the catboilers so that they could add the anchor to the url in the same way that catfix adds the language tag. It might make it easier if the anchor and the parameters/suffixes were all the same.
: The difficult part would be keeping the unsuffixed category empty: I don't really see a way to inform people who add the affix templates to etymologies about whether the morpheme they're adding has suffixed categories- they would have to check. I suppose you could have the catboilers check for both suffixed subcategories and entries being present at the same time, and adding the unsuffixed categories to a maintenance category. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 01:51, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I was thinking of numbers as well at first, but you mentioned senseid. If we're going to be using senseid (which we should) then why not use the senseid itself as the disambiguator? We'd have something like [[:Category:English words suffixed with -er (agent noun)]], and the page {{m|en|-er}} itself would have {{temp|senseid|en|agent noun}}.
:: This does bring up a shortcoming of senseid though. It's designed and intended for tagging individual senses. But what if we want to tag whole etymologies or parts of speech? Do we need a new template, or should we just continue using the existing senseid? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:37, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
: How about using the part of speech in the category name? English nouns suffixed with -xyz? This would require a pos= parameter in the template call, though. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 13:09, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
:: That's not going to work if many have the same part of speech. Part of speech is not enough to uniquely separate them. Consider for example {{m|en|bystander}} versus {{m|en|bylaw}}. Moreover, it doesn't work at all with the PIE root categories or any other case where POS is not relevant. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 13:33, 2 August 2015 (UTC)

== Category:(langname) plurals and Category:(langname) noun plural forms ==

:''Continuing the discussion from [[Module talk:category tree/poscatboiler/data/non-lemma forms#Plurals and noun plural forms|Module talk:category tree/poscatboiler/data/non-lemma forms § Plurals and noun plural forms]]''
Right now both Category:(langname) plurals and Category:(langname) noun plural forms exist, their descriptions are the same "(langname) nouns that are inflected to be quantified as more than one (more than two in some languages with dual number)." And they are used in mostly the same way. The main difference is that there are counterparts to Category:(langname) noun plural forms, such as Category:(langname) noun dual forms, which don't exist for Category:(langname) plurals. And this also follows with the naming scheme of (langname) adjective * forms.

I think we should either change plurals to be more general ((langname) terms that are... (vs (langname) nouns that are...)) and move it out of noun forms, or better yet just remove it. Note that (langname) singularia/dualia/pluralia tantum categories exist. [[User:Enoshd|Enosh]] ([[User talk:Enoshd|talk]]) 18:56, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
: I proposed merging the plurals category into the noun plural forms category before, for consistency with other categories. I still support this. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:02, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I thought the goal was to merge any plural category into their appropriate forms category. For example [[:Category:Hungarian plurals]] were merged into [[:Category:Hungarian noun forms]] a long time ago. So there is no separate category for plurals at this moment. Isn't the goal the same for all languages? Is this discussion related: [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_moves,_mergers_and_splits#Category:French_plurals_to_Category:French_noun_forms_or_Category:French_noun_plural_forms]? --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 20:18, 2 August 2015 (UTC)

:::::I support doing this in general.

: ''Finally'' done for English. That was a lot of work for sure. A lot of entries needed manual fixing too so it wasn't just a simple bot run. In many entries, the plural-of definition was mixed in with other "proper" lemma definitions even though these should be kept to separate noun sections. There were also many entries where the headword line specified a noun lemma, rather than a noun plural form. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:24, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

== Thai transliterations with tones ==
{{movedfrom|Wiktionary:Grease pit/2015/August#Thai transliterations with tones}}

Native speakers seem to dislike dictionary and textbook transliterations designed for learners, which includes tones and replace it with {{w|Royal Thai General System of Transcription}} (RTGS). I see my older edits replace toned transliterations with RTGS.

I think it's a problem. The standard Thai transliteration system (RTGS) lacks not just tones but displays short and long vowels the same way, merges some consonants. I think it can be used as one of the systems but not the main one. I mentioned this in [[User_talk:Iudexvivorum#Fixes_to_.E0.B9.80.E0.B8.A8.E0.B8.A3.E0.B8.A9.E0.B8.90.E0.B8.A2.E0.B8.B2.E0.B8.98.E0.B8.B4.E0.B8.9B.E0.B9.84.E0.B8.95.E0.B8.A2|this discussion]].

I insist that transliterating Thai tones is very important, not just the nominal but irregular tones as well. We could include RTGS along with phonetic transliterations (another parameter in Thai headwords?).

For example, {{l|th|ฉัน}} is nominally "chăn" but normally pronounced "chán" (pronoun), also {{l|th|ไหม}} (sense 1) is pronounced "mái" (nominally "măi"). I suggest we should use '''toned''' transliterations, as dictionaries and textbooks do, not as prescribed by the Thai government. {{ping|Stephen G. Brown|Iudexvivorum|Iyouwetheyhesheit}}. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 12:17, 3 August 2015 (UTC)

# I agree that we need a romanisation system that better reflects tones, short and long vowels, etc.
# What system should we use then?
# The system developed by Thai2english (T2E) might be okay. But the [http://www.thai2english.com/ T2E machine transliterator] should be used with caution, as it sometimes gives incorrect transliterations (see the table below).
# Some other systems that might work:
## The now-defunct 1939 version of the RTGS ([http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1941/JSS_033_1d_RoyalInstituteTranscriptionOfThaiIntoRomanCharacters.pdf English translation]) contains a general system and a precise system (which records tones, short and long vowels, etc.).
## The [http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf ALA-LC system] is generally used by libraries in English-speaking countries. But this system lacks tone marks. (Could we add tone marks ourselves?)
## {{w|ISO 11940}} is used in academic context.

:I completely agree that transliterations need to reflect long vowels and tone marks. If I'm trying to learn Thai, it will do me no good to have important phonetic information like this left out. Native speakers should not be the ones determining transliteration; translit is not designed for them. However, I think that this T2E system looks just awful, and I don't think it will help. People expect foreign words to follow the usage where a e i o u stand for the sounds they have in Latin and Spanish, rather than using weird things like ''ay'' for /e/, ''oo'' for /u/, ''or'' for (presumably) /ɔ/ (this latter notation is especially unhelpful for American English speakers), etc. ISO 11940 won't work either because it's a translit system in the narrow sense in that it reflects the writing rather than the pronunciation (properly speaking, Wiktionary misuses "transliteration" to mean "transcription" but that is a discussion for another day). Adding the tone marks to the ALA-LC system is not a bad idea; you could imagine taking the T2E tone marks and adding them to the ALA-LC system. You could also imagine rewriting long vowels as e.g. ''aa'' instead of ''ā'', to avoid the stacking up of diacritics when long vowels are combined with tone marks.

:{{ping|Iudexvivorum}} Thanks. Good job! I was going to suggest the system used by Benjawan Poomsan Becker. In his dictionaries he uses special characters for vowels "ʉ" for {{lang|th|อึ}}, "ɛ" for {{lang|th|แอะ}}, "ɔ" for {{lang|th|เอาะ}} and "ə" for {{lang|th|เออะ}}. Long vowels are simply duplicated, e.g. {{l|th|ตืน}} is "dtʉʉn". Tone marks are used on the first vowels only, e.g. {{l|th|เบิก}} is "bə̀ək". Tone marks are (using "a"): "a" (1 - no tone mark), "à" (2), "â" (3), "á" (4) and "ǎ" (5). Like T2E he uses d-dt-t, b-bp-p.
:Using that system the examples above become:

:# The term [[อธิกมาส]] is never pronounced "a-thik-mat" (a-tík-mâat). Grammatically, it is pronounced "a-thi-ka-mat" (a-tí-gà-mâat), as it is from Sanskrit [[अधिकमास]] ''adhikamāsa''. But people also pronounce it as "a-thik-ka-mat" (a-tík-gà-mâat) and this pronunciation has become so popular. The {{w|Royal Institute Dictionary}}, the official dictionary of the Thai language, therefore accepts both pronunciations.

:If I were to design a Thai translit system, I'd want the following:
# Use diacritics for tones rather than numbers; numbers look ugly to me and take up extra room.
# Use double letters rather than macrons; this is necessary with diacritic tonal marks to avoid double diacritics.
# Don't separate syllables with hyphens; that looks ugly to me and takes up lots of extra room.
# Use ''t th d'' rather than ''d t dt''.
:However, if Benjawan Poomsan Becker's system satisfies 1-3 but not 4, then maybe we should go ahead and use it in the interest of using an existing system rather than rolling our own. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:31, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Iudexvivorum}} Thanks for providing this info. Irregular pronunciation was a side question. We still want to transliterate Thai words with irregular pronunciations phonetically. BTW, you can use automatic transliterations for Sanskrit, e.g. {{m|sa|करणि}}, {{m|sa|गर्हा}}, {{m|sa|प्राज्य}}, etc. Unfortunately, it seems that some online dictionaries, including [http://www.thai2english.com/ thai2english] and [http://www.thai-language.com/ thai-language.com] don't always provide phonetic transliterations or respellings for irregular words. (The latter uses yet another transliteration system, which is great for learning but not good for dictionaries) If I get some words wrong, I'd appreciate your corrections!
:: {{ping|Benwing}} I favour Benjawan Poomsan Becker's system but it also uses hyphens, like Thai2English. Hyphens can be either removed or added regardless of what system we choose. It's easier to read Thai correctly when syllables are split by hyphens. Initials and finals are pronounced quite differently in Thai like in many East Asian languages and like many East Asian languages, consonants change pronunciations when they are finals, specifically - s, ch, j, d, dt, t are all pronounced as a clipped "t" [t̚] when they are finals, p, bp, b, f are all [p̚], g, k are [k̚] and n, l and r become [n]. It's important to separate clusters like "kla" from "-k-la", "tra" from "-t-ra", etc. [[User:Stephen G. Brown]] also favours using solid words, without hyphens. There are pros and cons with languages like Thai with both. Textbooks and dictionaries favour hyphens, sometimes spaces after each syllable.

::: {{ping|Atitarev}} As for hyphens, I guess I'm used to Pinyin, written without them. But I also kind of would have expected final ''s'', ''ch'', ''j'', etc. to be transcribed as ''t'' to follow the pronunciation. But I imagine whatever Becker does should work fine. If dictionaries tend to use hyphens, for example, then that's what we should do. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 21:35, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

== Feedback on alternative layout for [[Template:de-decl-adj-table]] ==

I created an alternative layout for this template, see [[User:CodeCat/de-adj]]. The three sections for strong, mixed and weak are now merged into one piece, with the distinction instead shown through columns. Please comment; is it better, worse? Should we use it? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 14:50, 3 August 2015 (UTC)

:Your table is more compact. On the other hand, the current arrangement with all strong forms in one place, all weak forms in one place, and all mixed forms in one place seems better for what I expect is the main use of the tables: someone has "[definite article] _ [noun]" or "[indefinite article] _ [noun]" or "_ [noun]" (i.e. they know whether they're looking for a strong or weak or mixed form), and they want to know what ending to put on "rot", for the case and gender they're dealing with, when they plug it into to that blank. Both online ([[:de:Flexion:rot|de.Wikt]], [//www.canoo.net/inflection/rot:A?lookup=caseSensitive Canoo]) and print references seem to favour the "all strong (etc) forms in one place" format. Notably, I would expect printed works to prefer a more space-saving compact format if they didn't think there was a compelling reason for the longer format. OTOH, if your table were rotated 90°, it might be compact enough to have the advantage of fitting all on one screen for mobile users (but as it is, I imagine it's still too wide). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 00:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:: The main reason I made it was to show the similarities of forms between strong, weak and mixed declensions. This is something that I personally always struggled with, so I though a different table layout might help. But I'll leave it then. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:34, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: A slightly different issue -- surely the order "nom gen dat acc" is unhelpful for German? My German textbooks use "nom acc dat gen", which IMO is far better since nom and acc are so often the same. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:37, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: I agree that this order is more helpful. The order used for old Germanic languages is generally nom acc gen dat, and this is still used for Icelandic. I never saw the point in having accusative fourth; it's "traditional", but traditions are superceded when we realise they're stupid. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:11, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Like Benwing, I'd prefer nom-acc-dat-gen. Nom-gen-dat-acc was traditionally the most common order, but I wouldn't mind improving upon tradition, and there certainly are references which have already done so, as Benwing notes; e.g. Günter Kempcke, ''Wörterbuch Deutsch als Fremdsprache'' (2000); Paul G. Graves, Henry Strutz, ''Master the Basics: German'' (1995, {{ISBN|0812090012}}; David Crowner, Klaus Lill ''Impulse: Kommunikatives Deutsch Fur Die Mittelstufe'' (1998, {{ISBN|0395909341}}; Karsten Fink, ''Workbook Deutsch: Das Übungsbuch zu Eine wesentliche Grammatik'' (2014); and even Robert P. Ebert, Oskar Reichmann, Hans-Joachim Solms, ''Frühneuhochdeutsche Grammatik'' (1993), which all use Nom-Akk-Dat-Gen order.

::::::: My only objection is that I am so used to nom-gen-dat-acc that I get confused every time I see nom-acc-dat-gen. But I'll get over it if it's really a better order and we start using it more.

:::::::: Heh, I have the reverse problem. (*looks at second row of inflection table* "what?! there's no way that's the accusative form..." *looks at legend* "oh, it really isn't.") I don't think all languages can necessarily be handled the same; perhaps for some (e.g. Latin) there really is a case for nom-gen order, while for others we already use nom-acc order (e.g. Proto-Germanic, Middle Dutch). I'd rather handle German first and worry about unrelated languages I don't speak later (e.g. Finnish, which uses nom-gen-part-acc, in contrast to Hungarian which uses nom-acc-dat). [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:11, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: I agree with [[User:-sche]] that we should do one language at a time. Different languages may have different orders that make the most sense, and also there's the issue of tradition -- German textbooks often prefer nom-acc-dat-gen but Old English textbooks use nom-acc-gen-dat. Sanskrit has a traditional order nom-voc-acc, inst-dat-abl, gen-loc which makes total sense for Sanskrit (and for PIE, and it looks like we indeed use it for PIE) but for Latin the order that makes the most sense might be something like nom-voc-acc, gen-dat, abl-loc, which is similar but moves the genitive. Lithuanian seems to have its own order nom-gen-dat-acc-inst-loc-voc and people working on it might object to changing the order (although personally I think the first two should be nom-voc because they're the same in the plural). [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 01:32, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::: For Slovene, the traditional order is nom-gen-dat-acc-loc-ins, but on Wiktionary that's changed into nom-acc-gen-dat-loc-ins. So here, too, genitive precedes dative. For IE languages with a vocative, the order should indeed be nom-voc-acc, like for Proto-Germanic. Balto-Slavic languages tend to put the vocative last; for Proto-Slavic and Proto-Balto-Slavic we currently use the order nom-acc-gen-loc-dat-ins-voc. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 01:40, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::: Russian seems to do nom-gen-dat-acc-ins-prep which reverses the order of the last two from Slovenian (since "prepositional" is really the locative case). But it would make a lot more sense to move the acc to come after nom, like we do for Slovenian, since the acc is usually the same as either nom or gen (presumably Slovenian is like this too). I guess the point is that the most appropriate order depends somewhat on the language ... for German, acc-dat-gen makes sense since dat and acc are often the same but gen is different, whereas for Russian, acc-gen-dat makes sense since gen and acc are often the same.

But I totally disagree with simply deleting the pages that use this template, as in [[kljenuta]] and [[κυκλῶν]]. They should be left alone until someone manages to fix them up to specify which inflection is involved. As for templates like {{temp|de-inflected form of}} instead of the generic one, I'm not sure the point of them, but I imagine CodeCat can explain, and at least there is no loss of information.

::::: Just so we're on the same page, "all the entries she has bot-deleted" = zero entries, and she only deleted three by hand ([[kveldi]], [[kljenuta]], and [[κυκλῶν]]). The bot work consisted of switching German uses to {{temp|de-inflected form of}} (which was proposed on the 22nd, met with agreement from a German speaker on the 23rd, and thereafter met with silence until after the changes had been made; only then did someone object) or relatedly switching Yiddish and Luxembourgish uses to corresponding templates. The fact that more languages than were initially thought use {{temp|inflected form of}} may mean we want to go back to the general-purpose template and use langcodes, rather than using language-specific templates — if so, we can do that, since nothing was deleted, but rather only renamed.

* Manual creation of a subset of word's inflected forms should be banned, and such entries deleted. Making such entries only complicates botting the rest of the inflection in the future. Too much time is wasted cleaning up such entries. If you are creating inflected forms manually either create it entirely for a lemma, using one and only one template, or don't create it at all. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 09:13, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
*: No it shouldn't, and no they shouldn't. I don't know how to use a bot, and I don't always have the time to create entries for all the inflected forms. I often create entries only for those inflected forms that already exist as spellings in other languages. For example, if some random Irish or Old Irish verb form happens to share a spelling with an existing Spanish entry, I'll create the Irish form there, but I won't bother creating brand-new entries for all the other forms of the verb. In other words, I'll work to remove orange links from inflection tables, but not (always) black/red ones. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 10:39, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
*:: Extinct languages like Old Irish which have irregular paradigms and limited attestation of inflection should of course be manually treated.

== {{temp|ux}} in Eastern Mari? ==

Recently, {{user|CodeCat}} changed the format of the examples in Eastern Mari ''[[лум]]'', inserting {{temp|ux}}. The result looked like this: [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BC&oldid=33764187#Eastern_Mari]. I certainly understand the need to use standard templates, but the resulting format was much less compact and less practical: three lines per example (including transliteration). Since I thought one line per example would be nicer on the eye and easier for anyone actually interested in seeing how the word can be used, I reverted her change. But I wondered if it wouldn't be possible to change said templates (or create a new one) that has the one-line-per-example format, and keep using it. Would that be a problem to anyone?

:::: It's hard to determine length other than by counting characters, which is not so accurate. I think it is better to leave it as is.

== Sourcing etymologies? ==

Recently, in Latvian {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, I reverted a change that introduced a Proto-Baltic reconstruction in the Etymology section, without proper sourcing. Given the way the text was written, it would seem that the Proto-Baltic proposed reconstruction came from Karulis' ''Latviešu Etimoloģijas Vārdnīca'', when in fact it came from an as yet unpublished article by R. Kim. I changed the format, to make it clearer where the Proto-Baltic form was taken from. Can't we perhaps agree on a general policy for Etymology sections whereby we try to explicitly source what is what -- so that, if two protoforms from different sources are cited, the reader can know which was proposed by which source? The format doesn't have to be the one I used in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, of course, but it would be nice to have something that would avoid this kind of confusion.
A second, unrelated question is whether unpublished sources should be accepted in Wiktionary. I'd say no: let it be published before it can be cited here. But I don't know what the others here think. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:19, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
: My general issue with your etymologies is that they're huge blocks of text. They need to be structured better in order to be readable. The long list of cognates is not necessary either, especially if we already have PIE pages and, more recently, categories to hold them. At the very least, they should be made collapsible or presented in a separate paragraph to make the rest easier to read.
:: This is of course not the problem I wanted to talk about here, but OK, there we go...
:: The 'huge blocks of text' are necessary when the etymology is not simple, or is disputed, or involves changes, semantic or otherwise, that are not obvious, as in {{m|lv|liegt}}. When the etymology is simple -- just PIE to PB to the word, without semantic changes, as in {{m|lv|acs}}, you have only one short sentence. I suppose your problem here is how much information should be given: should there be only a reference to the etymon, with no indication of how you got from that form and from that meaning to the current state? Or should more information be provided? I, for one, favor the latter, because this extra information is important to judge and accept the etymology, and are part of the history of the word, which is what the etymology section is about. It is also often interesting and brings new light to the understanding of the word, as several other people here told me when commenting favorably on the 'huge blocks of text' that you dislike. Call that 'humanistic etymology' if you will.
::: I don't have anything against presenting a lot of information. My problem is more the way it's presented. One giant paragraph doesn't invite the user to read it, and instead they'll just go tl;dr at it. If I want to know, at a glance, what the origin is, I don't want to have to read through a lot of blabber to get to the point. So what I would suggest is to write etymologies focus first on the known and reconstructed history, and leave the details until later. That way, people who aren't interested in the extra details can skip them, rather than having to sift through. Make the information that users want more accessible by splitting it. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:26, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Most users don't want to look at etymologies, they just want to see what the word means; so they won't read the etymology (or at the alternative forms, or the pronunciation) at all. If they glance at the etymology section, they're as likely to go tl;dr at mysterious cabalistic symbols like ''*h₃ḗHḱ-ō'' as they are at longish texts. Only if they are interested will they  read it. Interestingly, the information I present is already in the format you suggest: the very first sentence gives the PB and the PIE etymon, you don't have to read any further than that. Perhaps the only necessary change here is to add a carriage return after that first sentence, to put the rest of the information in a separate paragraph? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::The list of cognates is less relevant, I agree. The only problem is that different sources often quote different cognates, and this may be a problem. One solution is to bypass cognates altogether, but this only works for the (relatively few) 'famous' words or roots that already have reconstructed forms here at Wiktionary (where one can add cognates and refer to the specific sources that mention them. But over 90% of Latvian words for which Karulis' LEV gives etymologies are not in this category: rather, they are words with only a couple of cognates, mostly in Baltic (e.g. {{m|lv|liegt}}) or maybe a couple of other non-Baltic languages. It will be a long time before those etyma have Wiktionary pages, so eliminating these cognates looks like a bad idea. I would agree, though, with the cases in which there is already a good Appendix page with the etymon (as long as different cognates proposed by different sources are clearly distinguished there). Do you have one such example, so we could discuss the format further?
::: If sources conflict, then Wiktionary has to find a compromise through the usual consensus process. Consensus may invalidate some sources or even all of them, or choose a particular one that seems most usable by the people discussing the matter. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:28, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Sure. Let it happen, then. The LEV, for instance, cites cognates that are not cited in some Wiktionary reconstructed entries; should I add them?

:: Back to the problem at hand. Yes, that would be good, so separate paragraphs for your PBS etymologies (with correct sourcing) might be a good idea. You could start such paragraphs with 'According to a diffferent source,...' and then add the information. Or you could mention the forms with a footnote to the source, as I did in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}. Either way would be OK with me, as long as the wording is fluent and there is no confusion as to what comes from where. What I would disagree with is what you did before: just adding a form with no sourcing to a text that is itself attributed to a specific source, as if that form also came from the same source  (i.e., your original PBS etymon at {{m|lv|ūdrs}} looked like it came from Karulis' LEV, when in fact it came from Kim's unpublished paper). 
:: Besides, note that English {{m|en|fang}} (from {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}) -- where you find one of those 'huge blocks of text' you so much dislike -- does NOT mention the two proposed PIE etyma mentioned under {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}: rather, it only mentions the first one, and without references to sources. So the information under {{m|en|fang}} is misleading at best. Shouldn't such things be changed in a more principled way, so that a reconstructed entry does not seem to be in contradiction with the information found in the etymology section of one of its reflexes? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:23, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:: And I would add that I don't think it's a good idea, in principle, to cite unpublished sources. (But maybe Kim's paper has already been published? It was going to come out in a Handbook, as I recall; maybe it is already there?) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:12, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
::: This is the problem with the paragraph approach that you use. You source the whole paragraph, which makes it impossible for anyone to make adjustments to the text. Any edits make it no longer faithful to the source. Instead what should be sourced is individual facts. That way, people can add or change things without invalidating the references. Again, splitting etymologies into separate sections with paragraph breaks and lists should help with that. Again look at {{m|gem-pro|*fanhaną}}: each list item has its own separate sourcing.
:::: Yet I did source other forms in {{m|lv|ūdrs}}, for example, so that it is clear that the PBS form is not from the LEV; just put the footnote next to the material from the other source, not at the end of the paragraph. Why not make it standard practice? Another possibility is simply to start a new paragraph with a different source, perhaps starting with "A different source claims that..." or something similar.

:::: Nowadays everything is on the internet: manuscripts, unpublished sources, papers at various levels of completion... because we always want to invite comments from other interested researchers, comments that may improve a paper even before it's completely finished (academia.edu is a great site for this, as are individual researchers' pages at their institution website). When a paper is ''published'', however, it is officially released, be it on paper, be it in a publishing website. After that, it can no longer be edited or altered; and the year of its publication becomes fixed. Also, a published paper went through a refereeing process in which it was read and commented upon by two or three of the author's peers; an unpublished paper, of course, didn't. So the jist of it is that an unpublished paper is (supposed to be) less good and less final than its published version. Its author, for instance, wouldn't like you to cite an unpublished version if there is a published one alreday.

::: Different pages conflicting on each other is an unfortunate effect of how Wiktionary works. There's not much that can be done about it other than checking and updating things regularly. I would say that generally, the reconstruction pages are more reliable than the etymologies within entries, as they've been created and reviewed by more knowledgeable editors. Etymologies in entries often tend to be copied from just one source, often an outdated or nonspecialised one. They are then inserted into entries by editors who are relatively inexperienced with such matters, so that they are not able to spot and correct problems in their sources. And then, when new entries are created for cognate terms, then the etymologies are just copied over. This tends to propagate old/bad etymologies. And it's one of the reasons I prefer keeping etymologies to a bare minimum and letting the proto-language pages handle the rest. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:33, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: This is, again, difficult for words that have a more complicated history, as I mentioned above. For such words, their etymology section is the only place where, say, discussing a strange semantic evolution or comparing two or three different etymologies is logical: after all, in the reconstructed entries, you are not interested in the details of the semantic evolution of one reflex in one sub-branch of the family (I haven't seen a single reconstructed proto-entry here that does that); rather, the focus is on the reconstructed protoform and how it fits in the proto-system. So I think you would lose more than gain by doing that. The only thing that I would indeed relegate to the reconstructed entries is the list of cognates -- assuming that we can source cognates that occur in only one source, for instance.
:::: And here's a final thought: if inconsistencies are unavoidable at Wiktionary, if no policy can be devised to address them, then we're basically giving up on the idea that Wiktionary can become a quality work.

* I support banning original research with reconstructions in etymologies, as well as inventive editorial corrections, such as how "ū́drā́-" (the form cited in the article by R.K.) became "ūdrāˀ (which is what CodeCat inserted in the etymology). Additionally, for protolanguages, when there is no accepted general framework, which is the cases with Proto-Baltic/Proto-Balto-Slavic, all of the competing theories should be presented on an equal footing. That means that there can be no single and "true" reconstruction, and that there could be multiple inflection tables for a word according to different sources. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 10:19, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

To have individual words/forms in different systems based on who attested the particular word/form (e.g. <samp>''fooba·r'', plural ''foobārs''</samp>) would confuse readers into thinking the vowels were of some different quality.

As for "ū́drā́-" vs. "ūdrāˀ", it's not obvious to me what's going on here. Do the two acute accents indicate Balto-Slavic acute? If so, then it's fine to convert them to use the superscript glottal stop, which can be viewed as simply another way of indicating the BS acute register -- the fact that it expresses an opinion as to how that register was phonologically realized is irrelevant here. But then shouldn't it be "ūˀdrāˀ"? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 07:16, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Using acute accent marks to indicate the acute is actually very misleading, because Proto-Balto-Slavic ''also'' had a proper phonemic word accent like that of PIE. We should definitely use the same symbol, ´, to denote the accent in both of them. Anything else would just be unnecessarily confusing. That said, it does seem that there is somewhat of a linguistic consensus that the acute register involved some kind of glottal feature. The Latvian broken tone is a direct continuation of the acute, and is realised as glottalisation. So if there is any ''serious'' disagreement among linguists about the approximate nature of the acute, then I would like to hear about it. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:42, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

== Sourcing etymologies ''bis'': a proposal ==
Well, here is a modest proposal for sourcing (and otherwise formatting) etymologies in etymology sections:
* For "simple" etymologies (A < proto-B ''AA'' < proto-C ''AAA''),
(a) State ''in the first sentence'' what the path is from the current form to the oldest protoform you want to cite ('From proto-B ''AA'', from proto-C ''AAA''). Make it a separate paragraph.<br>
(b) Further infomration (semantic evolution, irregular transformations, etc.) can be described in the following paragraph, if need be, as succinctly as possible.
* For "complicated" etymologies (there are several suggested paths or etyma):
(a) Start with "There are (two, three, several) proposed hypotheses:";<br>
(b) State each hypothesis in a single sentence in a separate paragraph, starting with a letter -- (a), (b), (c), etc. -- to identify the hypothesis;<br>
(c) If further information is necessary on a given hypothesis, add it in a separate paragraph after all the hypothesVes, referring back to it by its letter.
* Cognates would be listed, ''in full agreement with the source'' (i.e., no tampering with the data!) in a separate paragraph at the end. If one of the protoforms (preferably the oldest) already has a good, consensus-approved entry in the Appendix, then all, cognates to that entry, ''making sure that each cognate is duly and correctly sourced''. (This is not the current state in most reconstructed entries here, and those interested in entering protoforms should add their sources.)
What do y'all think?
:I'm impressed with the detail you put into [[ūdrs]]. My only suggestion would be to put the cognates into a separate paragraph to avoid the "wall of text" feeling. It sounds like you're in agreement with this. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:37, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

I agree that basically cognates (at least for the 'richer' words with cognates in many branches) should be in the reconstructed entry page, but we need to know which forms should be there, from which sources... or else we simply don't know what kind of information we have there.

::: Yes, you can add the cognates to the proto-entry and source them there. That way the information from LEV can be enjoyed by everyone, not just the viewers of the Latvian page. For the format of referencing individual descendants you can look at {{m|ine-pro|*tep-}}. As to which descendants should be there and from which sources, I think at first ''all'' descendants from ''all'' sources can be added. If people have objections, a centralized discussion will happen on the talk page of the proto-entry or in [[WT:ES]]. The bad cognates from outdated sources will be eventually weeded out.

Sure, LEV says "from Proto-Baltic", but we understand that in essence what he is saying is that {{m|lv|ūdrs}} is from PIE {{m|ine-pro|*udrós}}, whatever the intermediate details. When my dated Armenian equivalent of LEV says {{m|xcl|հոտ}} is from PIE *''ōd''-, I understand that I should list it under modern PIE {{m|ine-pro|*h₃ed-}} and still reference my old source. I have seen it done by academic scholars. Martirosyan 2010 can write that a source in 1920s derives a word from such-and-such PIE root and use modern reconstruction for that root. It seems to me that you are trying to give a literal translation of LEV in Wiktionary. That is a job for Wikisource, not Wiktionary.

:::::::: This is not about canonicalization. Those glottal stops are phonemes on their own in the reconstruction of Proto-Balto-Slavic by the Leiden School, and according to it only after the parent language disintegration did individual branches developed their own acute/circumflex distinctions. The notation with acute accents by R. K. is an entirely different reconstruction, where acute accent marks indicate intonation/tone. Those two also have different originating points - the glottalic theory of PIE vs. the standard PIE Frankenstein's monster with laryngeals, genders and thematic inflection existing contemporaneously. You can't mix those two notations, because they refer to two different protolanguages, in two different chronological stages. There are also other differences that go beyond mere characters substitutions. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 12:19, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: I think my point still stands, though, that these ''can'' be viewed as equivalent notations, with acute register vs. non-acute register marked either by acute accent vs. tilde (or circumflex) accent or by presence or absence of superscript glottal stop, without necessarily committing to a phonological interpretation of the notation. As long as it's agreed that there was a two-way register distinction -- regardless of whether that is interpreted as tonal, as glottal, or whatever -- then the notations are equivalent in that you can convert from one to the other without loss of information, and we may as well be consistent. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 12:53, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::: What does the "two-way register distinction" actually mean? It's a meaningless notion, vague and abstract. Those symbols mean different things in different protolanguages. Leiden School theory also has short *o and *a, and different assumptions on ''Auslautgesetze'' and paradigms leading to different endings and forms in inflections. Also, some of the origins of the glottal stop or "acute" are disputed (Winter's law formulation, long/hyperlong vowles), which in particular renders the acute accent notation inapplicable, whereas with the glottal stop you can just use parentheses as is the customary notation for optional parts of reconstruction. Lastly, the superscript notation is baised as to the phonation character of what you call the Balto-Slavic "acute register" - there are different theories (rising/falling tone, glottalization/stod). It's best not to mix those two protolanguages, and use two different reconstructions. There are some Proto-Slavic appendices that already do it like that. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 13:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
{{outdent}} "register distinction" is an abstract way of referring to a distinction with unknown phonetics, but it's certainly not meaningless, and more than the three laryngeals of PIE, which are equally abstract. No one would have any problem regularizing e.g. Ringe's laryngeal notation, where he writes something like ''ç x xʷ'' in his Tocharian book, into more standard ''h₁ h₂ h₃'', even though they may have a completely different interpretation of what these symbols mean phonologically. Differences that cannot be treated as notational variants, e.g. differences in which register or vowel length is reconstructed in a particular word, or in numbers of vowels, obviously shouldn't be confounded, but when there's an equivalence to be made between notational variants I don't see the point of not making it. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 17:00, 7 August 2015 (UTC)  
: But the difference is that the glottal stop is not a mere "abstract register". It's a phoneme with a very specific phonetic value. Nobody disputes the phonemic status of PIE laryngeals. The differences between the protolanguage described by Ronald Kim (which has no glottal stop as a phoneme, and "acute" is a property of certain vowels) and the one of the Leiden School are irreconcilable and these two should not be mixed. This "canonicalization" is a thinly-veiled attempt at giving undue prominence to certain theories at the expense of others. It should be resisted and denounced. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 17:09, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:: The difference you mention is nothing more than relative chronology and allophony. Compare the sequence -Vnh- in Proto-Germanic. It eventually gave way to -Ṽ:h-, with a long nasal vowel. It doesn't matter in the slightest whether we write one or the other, because they represent the same phonological units. It's merely a matter of phonetic interpretation, but notation certainly does not have to indicate any particular phonetic reality. The same applies here with the acute. The interpretation in which there is an actual glottal stop, and the one in which there is merely glottalisation or some other change in the vowel, are different interpretations of the same phonological units. How you interpret it phonetically, or denote it in writing, is completely irrelevant to what it ''is''. It's the acute, nothing more, nothing less. Whatever symbol we choose to show that it's there is equally valid, because it's just a symbol that says "acute is here". —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:00, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::I am not trying to give prominence to one theory over another. I'd be just as happy if you denote the acute with a superscript A, and the non-acute with a superscript B (or vice-versa). That makes it obvious that we're talking about what is ultimately an abstract register difference. It is entirely analogous to the situation in Old Chinese, where everyone agrees there was a distinction between "Type A" and "Type B" syllables but no one agrees what the relevant feature was. Some think type B syllables have an extra /j/ phoneme before the vowel, some think type A syllables have pharyngealization of the syllable-initial consonant, some think the difference is vowel length, some think it's a phonation difference (creakiness/breathiness/whatever), etc. But these theories are hardly irreconcilable just because of this. My concern is not to favor one theory over another but to avoid needless complication introduced by notational differences. Since you don't seem to ever believe in canonicalizing notations, we might end up just having to agree to disagree. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 19:45, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

:Two points that have been made in previous discussions: one, we have to recognize that many obvious derivations are not cited, e.g. it is unlikely that a dictionary has gone through Spanish's (or, even more likely, Rumantsch's) massive corpus of words inherited from Latin and noted, in each and every case "yep, ''this one too'' was inherited from its obvious Latin predecessor, rather than, like, borrowed from Welsh or something". The same sort of research we undertake to determine what words mean, and e.g. how they inflect (in contradistinction to [[Appendix:English dictionary-only terms|what scholars and authorities think they mean]] and [[regnen|how scholars and authorities think they inflect]]), will sometimes be necessary when tracing etymologies.

:{{ping|Pereru}} There's still a bit of a "wall of text" effect, since the paragraph break is barely visible. If it could be set off better, I think people would object less. An alternative is to just list a few cognates, the subjectively most "interesting" ones (e.g. Greek, Sanskrit) and put the rest on a reconstruction page; and if such a page doesn't exist, create it. I personally don't object to seeing all the cognates listed on the Latvian page, but I understand the objections of the others, and I also see how it's likely to lead to inconsistencies (e.g. you give an etymology for the unexpected ''l'' and ''t'' in {{m|la|lutra}} whereas the reconstruction page doesn't and says it's unknown.

::Does indenting the cognate paragraph make it look better (see [[ūdrs]])? As for cognates in general, I do understand the feelings, but there are too few reconstructed entries in Wiktionary for all cognates to be easily transferable (and given that there are discussions about "what the right form" is, I'm a bit afraid of creating hundreds of new reconstructed pages on the authority of my Latvian source, the LEV, just to see them moved to other titles, or incorporated into other pages, etc.; I'd rather wait till there are more solid criteria. I frankly think Wiktionary simply follows no real policy on dealing with reconstructed entries, etymological sources, etc. -- everybody pretty much does whatever s/he wants... For differences between sources, case in point: Latin ''l'' in {{m|lv|lutra}}. I simply copied what my source had on this problem, while the reconstructed page made that claim apparently on the basis of an old etymological dictionary of Ossetian (though it is not clear whether the reference refers to the entire page or only to the reconstructed protoform -- again, we lack a good format for these things). Should we mention both? Only the most recent? The best source? Again, where's the policy?... --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 08:43, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
:::Indenting is better, although not perfect. I also tried indenting with ':' (where you don't see the bullet point) and setting the paragraph off with two blank lines. All are possibilities.
:::As for there being no real policy on reconstructed entries, I think you're right. Mostly that's probably because few people are actually creating those entries -- mostly it seems to be {{user|CodeCat}}, at least for IE languages. You might consider proposing a policy and getting people to vote on it (although that may be a bit like herding cats). [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:08, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

[[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 08:11, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'd like to have OP's third point clarified a bit. First, "listing cognates in full agreement with the source": sources on languages that have been unwritten or scarcely written until recently will often utilize technical or otherwise non-standard orthography or transcription; but I would suggest that this does not mean we are obliged to provide a separate source for the actual native orthography. E.g. the Udmurt reflex of Proto-Uralic {{m|urj-pro|*käle}} is {{m|udm|кыл}}, but all basic sources appear to list only the transliteration ''kyl'', ''kïl'', ''kɨl'' or ''ki̮l''. (And, as mentioned above, I agree that transcription schemes should definitely be unified here as well.)
:Second, would "making sure that each cognate is duly sourced" involve simply watching that people don't add new cognates out of the blue, or actually adding an inline citation for every single cognate? The latter would sound like overkill, whenever the majority of a cognate list is based on a reliable and comprehensive source, such as authoritative major etymological dictionary (or dictionaries), and is not explicitly contradicted by other equally reliable sources. Not every language group necessarily has such a source available of course, and establishing what sources to consider "reliable by default" (and to what extent — often a source might be quite reliable for ''cognates'' but outdated for ''reconstructions'' or ''etymologies'') should be determined by the consensus of editors involved with the language or language group in question.
:For "unexpected" cognates that are added from somewhere else than from a standard source (say, if someone were to release a paper arguing that Mongolian {{m|mn|хэл}} is a Uralic loanword), I'd be in favor of annotating the etymologies in more detail, but it should probably be sufficient doing this on the "main" etymology hubs — the entry's own page and its posited origin's entry (whether an attested form or a reconstructed proto-form) — rather than on every single page that refers to it. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 11:52, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::Here are my personal opinions on the clarifications you ask about:
:::'''(a)''' "In full agreement with the source" is not supposed to mean that you can't regularize transcriptions, as long as this is described in a policy page (e.g., [[WK:Etymology]] or [[WK:About Proto-Uralic]] or something like that), so that the interested reader can always see what can be one to source transcriptions.
:::'''(b)''' "Making sure that every cognate has a source" is meant as making sure the reader can tell where cognates came from. So, if all cognates come from the same source (some authoritative etymological dictoinary, for instance), you can refer to it only once at the end of the page. But then it becomes necessary to indicate deviations if they occur. If someone adds a new cognate to this page that happens not to come from the common source, then this cognate needs a footnote indicating its source, so the reader isn't fooled into thinking it is from the same source as the others. In short: don't necessarily add a footnote to every cognate, but always make it possible for the reader to know where the cognate comes from. If it's an original suggestion of a Wiktionarian (e.g., CodeCat, who is into original research), then also say so by adding an "original research" template. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:55, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
As I see it, a discussion on '''allowing "Notes" as a valid header''' should be considered.

Vahag has brought this up ([[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#.7B.7Breflist.7D.7D]]) and I'm running into a similar problem all the time. As ridiculously silly of an argument as it may be, I do, in fact, agree that numbered and bulleted references together look ugly AF. (I have even went to such ridiculous steps as removing a reference that didn't add anything critical just because it was bulleted while the other ones were numbered because of how unappealing it looks.)

In more general terms, I kind of get the feeling that there seems to be consensus that references are in fact valuable and add value to the entry, perhaps the discussion should focus more on how to allow more elegant ways of faithfully citing content, particularly in "controversial" cases, e.g., obviously one bulleted reference is enough under, say, an assertion that et {{m|et|kala}} and liv {{m|liv|kalā}} derive from the same source because, well, it's pretty obvious but then if there is a "weird" controversial cognate there isn't even a way of citing it inline (unless you want the awful looking mixing of numbered and bulleted refs.)

== Transliteration obligatory? ==
It seems that transliterating non-latin scripts has become obligatory in all templates, but in certain cases -- "latin-like" scripts like Cyrilic or Greek -- I think transliteration actually annoys more than it helps. Why is transliteration, especially of Cyrilic and Greek, obligatory in all cases, including inflection tables and examples? I would rather have it only next to the headword... Case in point: Eastern Mari ''[[лум]]'', where having two Mari lines is somewhat disruptive. Can't we have a parameter <code>tr=-</code> (which is what I used in this case) to avoid the obligatory transliteration? As things are, the only option is not to use templates... which I would prefer not to do. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:47, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
:Generally, we transliterate everything in Wiktionary -- we don't assume readers are able to handle foreign scripts. So I don't think it's a good idea to disable the translit just because it seems disruptive to you -- we're not limited in space or anything like that (and "disruptive" is in the eye of the beholder). [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 07:48, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
::I would also say that translit is especially important for an obscure language like Eastern Mari -- even though it's "just" Cyrillic, it invariably has different conventions from more familiar languages like Russian.

Wouldn't it be better to restrict transliterations to headwords, and leave them out of examples and inflection tables? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 13:53, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

Wouldn't it be possible, for instance, to have a second, alternative table with the transliterations? Perhaps with a clickable point to change one version of the table into the other?

You can ignore them if you don't need them but do you realise that other users may be interested? They may not know the script or willing to learn it, they could be interested in analysing the grammar, vocabulary or language comparison. Foreign scripts just put off some people who are only used to Roman letters. I know this for a fact - this includes people who are familiar with foreign scripts but not fluent in them and reading foreign characters takes some effort. Besides, I'm sure you're having Cyrillic in mind when wanting to get rid of transliterations but the change (if implemented) will affect all non-Roman scripts, some are very complicated and hard to read!

::{{ping|Atitarev}}, maybe I'm making this seem more important to me than it really is. It all boils down to an esthetical preference: examples plus translations tend to already be long enough, if you still add transliterations the result will often be longer than one line, and that offends my sense of proportion. I would prefer no transliterations even in languages whose script I don't read (I can read the Thai script, so that's not a big deal for me, but, for instance, I don't read Chinese characers; and yet, for me, lines with just the original Chinese example and a translation look nicer than those with the transliteration). The esthetics gets especially bad with inflection tables, which become at least twice larger than they need to be only to accommodate transliterations. Now, I understand and agree that others have a right to think differently, and I won't mind too terribly if things remain as they are. But if there's a chance of getting a nicer format... then I'm all for it! --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 06:20, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Pereru}} Thanks for the reply. Yes, various enhancements are welcome but until they are implemented, I think it's good to keep transliterations as they are. Yes, foreign language example can look nice but sometimes meaningless or very hard to digest. It is very true when you look for them. For me, full FL examples with translations and with transliterations (or phonetic guide/help like Japanese [[furigana]], Arabic vocalisations, word stresses, etc.) were always a blessing in learning the basic of new tongues in a relatively short period.

== Eastern Mari possessed forms ==
I'm thinking about how to do a template that will include possessed forms in Eastern Mari, but because every possessed form ('my house', 'your house', etc.) can also be inflected for ten cases, singular and plural ('my house', 'in my house', 'in my houses', 'to my house', 'to my houses', etc.), we end up having 6 persons x 20 cases x 2 numbers = 240 forms, most of which are predictably formed. This means creating tables that are rather big and unwieldy. I was wondering if someone working with similar cases (in other Finno-Ugric languages, or in Turkish, etc.) has found a better solution that just creating big tables? (Right now, I'm tempted to make each non-possessed declined form -- e.g., 'my house' -- an independent sublemma, with its own case inflection table under it, but I'm not sure this is the best solution.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:56, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

== Make Proto-Baltic an etymology-only language ==

Linguists don't all agree on the nature of the Baltic languages as a group. There are three main proposals, that I know of:
# Balto-Slavic splits into Baltic and Slavic. Baltic then split into East and West Baltic. (this is the traditional view)
# Balto-Slavic splits into East Baltic and Slavic-West Baltic. Slavic-West Baltic then split into Slavic and West Baltic.
# Balto-Slavic splits into East Baltic, West Baltic and Slavic.
Proto-Baltic only exists in the first of these proposals. Moreover, it has been noted that there aren't really any common linguistic changes that separate Proto-Baltic from Proto-Balto-Slavic. As reconstructed, the two are essentially identical.

In the past, we've deleted and merged different proto-languages when there is no definite agreement on their existence and definition, and when they are too similar to their parent language to make separate pages for them worthwhile. For example, Proto-Finno-Permic and Proto-Finno-Ugric were recently merged into Proto-Uralic. There was also a discussion on merging various Polynesian languages, although I'm not sure where that went. In any case, I don't see the value in having separate pages for Proto-Baltic reconstructions when they're all just going to be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic reconstructions. So I think that Proto-Baltic should be changed into an etymology-only language, so that it can be mentioned with {{temp|etyl}}, but there can be no entries or links to it. All existing links would be changed to Proto-Balto-Slavic. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:14, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

* '''Support'''. Like Benwing, my understanding of the scholarship is that Baltic is not a genetic group and there was no Proto-Baltic. Even Derksen, who writes of Proto-Baltic, says "I am not convinced that it is justified to reconstruct a Proto-Baltic stage; the term Proto-Baltic is used for convenience’s sake." ''Reconstructing Prehistorical Dialects: Initial Vowels in Slavic and Baltic'' says "Baltic scholars who have concerned themselves with this question conclude that one cannot reconstructed a Proto-Baltic." The situation seems comparable to Proto-Algonquian, which was initially reconstructed as Proto-Central-Algonquian (contrasted with Eastern and Plains), before scholars realized that only Eastern was a genetic group with a proto-language ([[PEA]]), and that what had been reconstructed as [[PCA]] was, with only a few minor changes here and there, simply Proto-Algonquian.

What is available out there often does have PB, not PBS, forms -- only those few words that are important for an author's paper, such as the Derksen paper you cite. In the absence of a body of consensus reconstructions for Proto-Balto-Slavic, disregarding the Proto-Baltic ones or changing them automatically into Proto-Balto-Slavic is simply too hasty. The work hasn't been done yet to justify this. We're still at "Proto Central Algonquian" time; to assume that the work of demonstrating that all those forms are simply "Proto Algonquian" has already been done is at best temerary. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:36, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

As to Benwing's confusion: the issue isn't whether it's a clade, but whether the details have been worked out on the proto-language. Also, proto-languages are theoretical constructs that are only as good as the information on which they're based: including Slavic in a reconstruction provides extra material to work with, so a PB reconstruction may not be as a complete a picture as a PBS one. I have no problem with documenting that a referenced reconstruction was for PB rather than PBS. My main issue has been with ''categorizing'' entries as ''derived from'' PB.

== Adding our own diacritics in quotations of prose works printed without them ==

I've had an ongoing debate in the past with [[User:Atitarev]] about whether we should add stress marks to quotations of Russian prose. He believes that this is helpful to readers, but I am against this for a number of reasons. Firstly, I believe that out of respect to the author and publisher, all of our quotations should reproduce as closely as possible the original work with the exception of the bolding we add to the word(s) that the quote is demonstrating. Secondly, this forces us in some instances to choose between two or more equally acceptable stress variants of some words, or worse in some cases between two or more homographs with different meanings. Note that this does not apply as much to poetry from which stress can be inferred by the meter, or to songs or movies in which the stress can be heard. This problem is significantly exacerbated in languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, where would not only be inferring stress, but also vowels, leaving much more possibility for ambiguity.

The question is: Should we (Wiktionary) do this in general? Should we do this for languages like Russian, even if not for languages like Hebrew and Arabic? Should we do this even for languages like Hebrew and Arabic? Should we remove diacritics from quotations where we have already added them? --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
: As far as I know, the practice is to leave quotes relatively unchanged. I don't think we add macrons to Latin or old Germanic quotes, for example. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:37, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Adding macrons to Latin is a completely different story, because these texts are often already printed with macrons. I'm not talking about always sticking with the most original quote version of the quote, but about sticking to existing publications. This question mostly applies to relatively modern quotations. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:55, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::: As for Arabic, stress of course doesn't really apply, but I think it would be a huge help to the reader to add the vowels to the extent that they can be inferred reasonably unambiguously. Reading Arabic is '''hard''' for non-fluent speakers due to the underspecified text, esp. with verbs. I think in the case of Russian, similar arguments could be made -- if you're concerned about ambiguous cases, just leave off the stress in those cases or (perhaps better) follow [[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]]'s convention of putting a stress mark in each possible place of stress. I'd also like to see individual words inside quotes linked -- again it would be a great help for the language learner. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 16:26, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Not all the quotations we include need to be targeted toward beginners. We can have usage examples with the full diacritics, which would be helpful for beginners. But quotations are meant to show how the words are really used in reality; and in reality, Russian is not written with stress marks and Arabic is not written with vowels. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:32, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: In reality we always (or should always) transliterate Arabic text, at the very least. (And who's to decide what's targeted towards beginners and what's not? The same arguments could be made for not transliterating at all.) [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 19:49, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: What I mean is that not ''everything'' needs to be targeted toward beginners who can't read without vowels. And even for people who are not so comfortable reading without vowels, it's not as hard when you already know what word you're looking at. With transliteration, we're not actually altering the original text; the original is still there and anyone who doesn't want or need the transliteration can ignore it. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:19, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::: Another thing is that adding adding vowels prevents us from being able to show how vowels actually ''are'' used in the text (such as the fatḥatān, šadda, and other sporadic disambiguators). This applies to all three of the languages I've mentioned. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:10, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
: When we're giving a direct quote, we should keep the original spelling of the whole quote, i.e. without Russian stress marks (unless we happen to be quoting some text that for whatever reason uses them). We should also keep '''е''' for '''ё''' if that's how it was spelled in the original. (I don't quite understand why we allow '''ё''' in page names in the first place.) We can include stress marks in the transliteration if need be, though that will mean writing the transliteration out manually instead of letting it happen automatically. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 10:55, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
::We allow '''ё''' in the page names because this is a dictionary convention, it's so also in the Russian Wiktionary. The Russian Wikipedia makes the letter mandatory throughout articles and many native speakers prefer to write it all the time. Letter '''ё''' isn't exactly banned in Russian! It's also considered a separate letter, not a '''е''' with '''two dots''' (две точки). Every Russian dictionary uses it in the alphabetical order. Knowing that '''ё''' is replaced with '''е''' by native speakers lets you figure out how to spell it in the real world. For the same reason, I don't see how adding stress marks, normalising texts with '''ё''', adding Arabic or Hebrew diacritics, Japanese furigana is a problem in quotations. Many editors suggest photographic image of the original texts, even using the glyphs. Modern Russian books don't reprint texts in the pre-1918 reform spellings. China republished all old books in the simplified script. Japanese publishers partially follow the post-war reform.
::Another point, some Russian books appear in accented forms with consistent usage of '''ё''', designed for foreigners or children. Or Arabic texts can be with or without vocalisations. Japanese texts appear with [[furigana]] ([[ruby]]) to help with the pronunciation, especially when aiming at young readers.
::My strong opinion is that dictionary should be user-friendly and help master languages, it's about the language, not the facts. Showing how languages are written out there in the real world can be described in appendices. Learners learn this as the first thing. For me, a learner of Arabic, is much more useful to have vocalised Arabic then telling me over and over again that diacritics are not used by Arabs. Imposed restrictions is the reason I dislike adding citations. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 12:46, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

::::: What do we violate by providing "самолёт лети́т на за́пад" instead of "самолет летит на запад" with word stresses and normalising "е" as "ё"? The text is the same, it just has accents to make the reading easier. It's completely uncommon in Russia to use pre-1918 reform spelling when quoting old authors and Chinese don't have to use traditional script when quoting old authors, regardless of what script the original was in. Chechen texts often replace Cyrillic [[palochka]] with |, l, 1, etc. for technical reasons but the normalised spelling distinguishes capital and small [[Ӏ]] and [[ӏ]] , e.g. {{m|ce|лугӏат}} (the correct spelling) will appear in a printed text as луг|ат, лугlат, луг1ат or лугӀат.

WikiTiki's and Anatoli's disagreement is very deep and philosophical. It stems from the disagreement over the purpose of Wiktionary. Anatoli and his camp see Wiktionary mainly as a learning tool for non-native speakers. Hence the reading aids in quotations, the note in [[Template:ru-adj1]] and the unscientific, pronunciation-based transliteration system for Russian. The other camp, which includes me, sees Wiktionary as a scholarly resource, a kind of an encyclopaedia of language, useful for native speakers too. One side wants to write an ''[[w:Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|OALD]]'', the other an ''OED''. Both projects are useful and have a right to exist, but we have to choose one. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 13:56, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'm not sure what you mean by "unscientific" here. Also, maybe I'm an optimist but I think it's possible to resolve this issue through compromise. As for OALD vs. OED, keep in mind this is the English Wiktionary, and hence designed for English speakers. That means that foreign-language entries are inevitably geared somewhat towards language learners, just like all cross-language dictionaries. I don't think there's much disagreement over this. This means the OALD isn't the right point of comparison. We're rather trying to create something like the OED for the English-language entries and the Hans Wehr dictionary for Arabic language entries (this is the best dictionary of Modern Standard Arabic I can think of), and similarly for other foreign-language entries.  [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 21:25, 9 August 2015 (UTC)

::[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]]. Neither OALD nor OED cover topics in detail we do here. Published Russian dictionaries lack transliterations, there's nothing to compare with. Well-known dictionaries are unconcerned about the Russian transliteration, they simply don't do it. When they do (in citations, etc.), you get both "narodno'''v'''o" (phonetic) and "narodno'''g'''o" (graphic) transliterations (genitive or animate accusative of {{m|ru|наро́дный}}). You made negative comments about word stresses and genders as well but most users and editors find them useful, AFAIK. Therefore, I have to use other languages again as examples, for the umptieth time.
::Examples of irregular pronunciations and transliterations, using very common words in various scripts:
:* Thai: {{l|th|ชาติ|tr=châat}} (written as "châa-dti") but the final "i" is silent. Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "châa-dti" or similar, with a transliterated "i"?
:* Korean: {{l|ko|십육|tr=simnyuk}} (written as "sibyuk"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "sibyuk" or similar?
:* Japanese: {{l|ja|今日は|tr=こんにちは, konnichi wa}} (written as "konnichi ha"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "konnichi ha" or similar?
:* Arabic: {{l|ar|شُوكُولَاتَة|tr=šokolāta}} (written as "šūkūlāta"). Can you find a (scientific) source, which claims that it should be transliterated as "šūkūlāta" or similar? Perhaps a better example is {{l|ar|إِنْجْلِيزِيّ|tr=ʾinglīziyy}} written as "ʾinjlīziyy".
:: I can give more examples where phonetic transliteration (closer to pronunciation) is considered standard and scientific. Are there sources that claim that "[[что]]" should only be "čto" and never "što" and "[[кого]]" should only be transliterated as "kogo" and never "kovo"? --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|обсудить]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|вклад]])</sup> 01:01, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Anatoli, Benwing, Russian transliteration has been discussed million times (see [[Wiktionary talk:Russian transliteration]]) without achieving consensus. Let's not start a new one here. I was merely pointing it out as an example of ''scientifically rigorous'' vs ''convenient''. The issue at hand are the usage examples. When you are giving a quote from Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin'', I want it do be without stress marks and in pre-reform orthography, as it was published [http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=8967 in 1833]. If you normalize the text, it is less valuable to me and others who are interested in diachronic, historical development of Russian. Language learners would prefer normalized quotes. Our needs are irreconcilable. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 10:50, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
::::If I were to provide citations for the pre-1918 reform spelling of {{l|ru|пока́мест}} (modern) - {{l|ru|пока́мѣстъ}} (pre-1918 spelling reform), then the old spelling would be more appropriate:

* Adding stress marks to attesting quotations of Russian prose is a poor practice, IMHO. Adding these to headword lines is acceptable; adding these to lists of terms such as synonyms and derived terms is equally poor, IMHO. In most places, terms should be presented in the form in which they appear in print. I don't believe the learners of Russian should be reminded on every single occassion how to pronounce; the headword line itself should suffice. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:40, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

== Tagging unsourced reconstructed entries ==
I've just made {{temp|needsources}} to tag reconstructed entries (protoforms) that were created without explicit published sources. Since, after all, reconstructed forms are simply hypotheses, not attested words, they need sources (who proposed that reconstruction, in what publication, and based on which cognates) just as much as a "normal" word needs usage examples so we know it really exists. I therefore suggest that any reconstructed entries that have no sources in them be tagged, so that those interested in them can add the sources. (I started doing this, but my edits were reverted since the issue had not been discussed here first, so I am doing this now.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 01:40, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
: I don't understand why they must absolutely have sources. From its conception, Wiktionary has been a dictionary and therefore stands on par with other dictionaries. Other dictionaries do not source all their definitions to another linguistic work; they interpret and present their research independently. In the same way, Wiktionary and its editors have directly interpreted evidence in the form of attestations. Parroting other dictionaries has always been explicitly forbidden and independent research of lexicographic content has been a requirement, enshrined in [[WT:CFI]] and the process of [[WT:RFV]]. For lexicographical content, we have never once required corroboration by an outside source; we require evidence and make our own decisions based on that through consensus and peer review.
: Because Wiktionary presents etymological information as well, it's also an etymological dictionary. That means that other etymological dictionaries stand on par with Wiktionary. Etymological dictionaries, too, present independent and sometimes novel interpretation of the evidence, and are not required to take all of their contents from other linguistic sources. Of course, when information is corroborated by another source, they can and do indicate this, to strengthen their own claims. But etymological works may equally question or refute what other sources say; they're not limited to parroting others.
: Wikipedia is an encylopedia, a compendium of existing knowledge. This makes sourcing vital to Wikipedia, and original research a problem. But as I have shown here, Wiktionary is of a very different nature, and through this nature it is bound by different rules. It's not a compendium of lexicographic or etymologic knowledge presented by others; it's an independent source of this knowledge. We are not subservient to other linguistic sources, we are their equivalents, or even competitors. Original research within Wiktionary is important, it's an integral part of how Wiktionary works and has always worked. Therefore, it's not appropriate to require sourcing to another linguistic work for information presented on Wiktionary. This goes directly against what Wiktionary is, and the principles and processes written down in our policies. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 12:09, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Contrary to the above, requiring references for etymologies is not against en wikt policies since we do not have any on the matter.

Some people are even pushing a requirement that etymologies should be referenced into [[WT:ETY]]; my removal ({{diff|32447868}}) of an undiscussed addition of such a requirement was undone. I think the whole section References in WT:ETY should be removed as not traceable to a discussion or vote showing consensus, but I have better things to do at this point; maybe a couple of months later. Again, while for definitions we have [[WT:ATTEST]] and [[WT:CFI]] in general, for etymologies we have a policy vacuum. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:10, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:::Let's see if I can help CodeCat understand why sources for etymologies are a good thing:
:::'''(a)''' Etymologies are '''hypotheses''', not '''the truth'''; the interested reader should be able to see why a certain etymology is given here rather than others, without havaing to trace some discussion of its correctness somewhere in the archives.
:::'''(b)''' Etymologies, being '''hypotheses''', have authors: unlike words, they aren't simply "in usage" or "out of usage" or "dated" and whatnot, they were actually ideas, good or bad, proposed by someone. To omit this information is (a1) a disservice to the interested reader, since it hides available information, and (a2) unethical, since it amounts to not giving credit to an author for his/her idea, which is a kind of intellectual theft
:::'''(c)''' To the non-specialist, more information is better than less information. I am sure that a specialist can probably quickly assess and evaluate the goodness of a specific etymology, but others would need more than that. Claiming you don't need this information because "expert Wiktionaries" can access the correctness of an etymology anyway is like claiming that attestations are not necessary to qualify a word for inclusion because "expert Wiktionarians" can tell if a very rare or dialectal word actually exists...
:::'''(d)''' "Other dictionaries don't do that" is not a good argument ("Wiki is not paper", etc.). Some do: etymological dictionaries, where the sources are so important they are usually listed at the beginning of the book rather than at the end, because the author knows that the interested reader will want to form his/her opinion on the author's choice of sources. Non-etymological dictionaries indeed often don't, but they also often don't cite any etymologies at all, and they certainly don't have appendices with reconstructed protoforms -- if we want to follow them, then we should delete all reconstructed entries, shouldn't we?
:::'''(e)''' "Etymological dictionaries present independent and novel interpretations of the evidence" -- indeed, ''and they always label it as such''! And they also ''always give sources for ideas that are not "independent and novel"''! Why should Wiktionary be any different? Personally, I am not against independent research, as long as it is (e1) labeled as such, and (e2) argued for, preferably on the same page. Why are you not doing that? Īn other words: Etymological dictionaries <u>do distinguish original ideas from other people's ideas, which they give sources for; why don't we -- why don't YOU -- do the same?</u>
:::'''(f)''' Mentioning sources '''is not equivalent''' to parroting other dictionaries' definitions--quite the opposite! Mentioning sources means ''respecting'' other people's intellectual property rights, and also giving the reader the possibility of exploring the basis for a given etymology being used here. 
:::Besides, both [[Wiktionary:Reconstructed_terms#References_and_verifiability]] and [[Wiktionary:Etymology#References]] mention the need for sources in etymologies. Why shouldn't we follow these guidelines?
::: '''{{reply to|CodeCat}}''', you seem to believe that sources vs. lack of sources boils down to Wikipedia vs. Wiktionary. It doesn't. The reason for writing adding sources to etymologies is that it ''is'' a good idea (see above), not a simple imitation of other wiki projects. Please get off the soapbox!... Also, it's not a question -- at least not to me -- of "original research". As I said elsewhere, I have nothing in principlpe against original research; I just want it to be labeled as such. If the reconstructed protoforms you created entries for are all your own work, then '''they should be labeled as such''', and your reasons for creating them with that form should be on their page (or on a page like [[WK:About_Proto-Indo-European]], or [[WK:About_Proto-Balto-Slavic]], etc.). I'm not "requiring sourcing ''to another linguistic work''", I'm just "requiring ''sourcing''"-- if it's your work, say so on the page! That's what etymological dictionaries do: they label their own work as such. It's also not about "criteria for inlcusion or deletion": I'm not saying 'delete it if it's original research', I'm saying 'label and argue for it if it's your work' -- not just in obscure discussions two years ago in the Scriptorium, but right on the reconstructed entry page! WHY THE HELL NOT? Something I really don't understand is why you are hellbent on obscuring the reasons why a certain protoform is included here. In what way does hiding the reasons/sources for including a form help Wiktionary become better? Claiming that "expert Wiktionaries" can judge it so we don't need to argue for them on their page is like claiming that "Expert Wiktionaries" can tell if, say, Arabic usage examples are correct or not, so we don't need to translate them into English on the page of the word they are an example for...--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:05, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: (a) Sourcing doesn't actually tell the readers any reasoning. It just suggests that the reasoning might be found in another work instead, but even that's no guarantee as plenty of other works just give forms without any arguments. I am completely for reasoning and giving arguments for reconstructions, within reason. Some widely known and accepted sound changes like Grimm's law should not need to be pointed out in every etymology. So I'm not sure how this point is relevant. External sourcing doesn't change anything about it. If anything, I understand your argument to mean that we should provide argumentation for etymologies in addition to, and regardless of, sourcing.
:::: (b) It can be assumed that all information on Wiktionary is the result of Wiktionary's own editorial process. All content on a wiki is already sourced through the page history, so that gives credit to everything users have ever added to pages. Adding references to Wiktionary users only complicates things. External sources are fine, but we should not be required to tag everything we add with our own usernames, that's just stupid.
:::: (c) Again, a source provides no information, it merely says where information came from. We use many specialised linguistic works as sources on Wiktionary, and I don't think many Wiktionary readers will have access to them. So to the majority of readers, the source is nothing more than a name.
:::: (d) I have nothing against providing a reference to a source when information is taken from them. I admit I have been rather sloppy about this, and still am to some degree. But I am trying to improve things, as you may have noticed from my recent edits to PIE root pages. Do as I say not as I do. Just because I'm not perfect doesn't mean I'm not right.
:::: (e) Again, I have nothing against sourcing information that ''does'' come from an external source. What I disagree with is requiring that all information comes from an external source; this is what your new template's wording appears to imply. I also disagree with sourcing particular ideas to individual editors. Wiktionary is a wiki, and information can and should be edited and improved by other editors. This means it's not right to place certain parts of pages on "lockdown", not allowing anyone else to edit them. Etymological information originating from within Wiktionary should be sourced to Wiktionary editors as a whole, and to editorial consensus. But since ''all'' information not sourced to external sources can be assumed to have been provided by Wiktionary editors, this is entirely redundant.
:::: (f) Copyright doesn't apply and never has applied to information alone. So intellectual property is not relevant here. Scientists give each other credit and require it from others, because of plagiarism, but that's not intellectual property as far as I know. And I have no idea what the laws and rules are on plagiarism anyway. Wiktionary doesn't have any rules for it.
:::: Those two pages you mentioned were written long ago, long before there was really any significant number of reconstructed pages. I also doubt whether they actually reflect consensus and common practice, so they should be changed to reflect what we actually do. My objections to your proposals, now and before, are that we should not be required to have an external source for all etymological information on Wiktionary. This is where my comparison with Wikipedia comes in. Wikipedia has a simple rule: unsourced material that is challenge can and should be removed. I object to bringing this practice to Wiktionary, as we are a dictionary (lexicographical, etymological and other) and it is in the nature of this project to be able to interpret, research and peer review available evidence (attested words) on our own.
:::: So, again, to recap: I have nothing against sourcing. If information comes from somewhere else, source it. That's a good thing. Explaining reasoning for particular reconstructions, in the entries themselves, is also a good thing. I have no problem against that either, but within reason. Very obvious things like Grimm's law probably don't need to be mentioned, but there is no objective standard for this and if we want to go this route, we should figure out among ourselves which information is obvious enough to leave out. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:39, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

:{{reply to|CodeCat}},
::'''(a)''': Of course, only if you mention bad sources. Good sources do have the reasoning behind the proposals. It's up to you if you cite good sources or bad sources. Don't cite bad ones; cite good ones. If you see bad sources being cited, mention that to the author or start a discussion about that source. Don't just omit it -- as always, <u>there is nothing to be gained by using a source -- including your own original research -- and not mentioning it</u>. How many etymological dictionaries do you know that fail to mention their sources? And they are not Wikipedia... Now, it would indeed be better if you added the entire reasoning behind a suggestion rather than just reference the source, but the latter is easier and is the standard practice in etymological dictionaries. And most reconstructed entries here -- especially the ones you made -- still lack such an explanation, which is why they should be tagged with {{template|needsources}}.
::'''(b)''': Sure. But as others have said there is no policy with respect to etymologies and their sources, so saying "it's the result of Wiktionary editorial process" still tells us nothing about what was done. What if I want to know the reasons? Where do I find this information -- an information that most etymological dictionaries give by means of, among other things, indicating their sources? And by giving detailed reasonings when it's their own idea?
::'''(c)''': A good source '''does''' provide information. Are you familiar with good etymological dictionaries? They provide further sources, so you can trace it down to the original proposer, and they provide rationales for deviant forms. They also compare different hypotheses, and often provide further evidence for preferring one or the other. Plus they list correspondences and sound laws, especially the least known ones. They're full of argumentation, reasonings, rationales... What the heck are you talking about? What sources are you talking about?
::'''(d)''': Good! Please continue doing that. If you add sources to your pages I have problems with them. In fact that is my entire point: not having sources and reasons for including a particular protoform on the page itself is '''not''' a plus for Wiktionary, it's actually, as you put it, being sloppy. I'm glad you're fixing that, and you'll get my support for this. The goal, of course, should be to fix everything.
::'''(e)''': And here we are apparently in full agreement: I am in favor of referencing external sources only when the information comes from an external source (duh!...). But now, "if" a given word is the result of your own original research, then this should be sourced, so that the reader knows that it is your original research. If you have your reasoning on the page, what the heck is bad about saying it is your idea? In what way is that bad for Wiktionary? And again, good etymological dictionaries do that (Karulis adds a big "K" to every paragraph in the LEV that contains his own ideas, for instance. That is what good etymological dictonaries do: they do not shy away from original research, but they label it as such and argue for it on the entry itself! Why is that so bad?) 
::'''(f)''': Intellectual property is not simply a question of law; it's a question of ethics. "Plagiarism", i.e. people taking advantage of other people's ideas without mentioning them, is exactly what the concept of intellectual property is supposed to prevent; why else do you think it exists? I think scientists don't own the legal copyright over their own ideas after they're published, but they certainly have the moral/ethical copytright. Do you think Dr Kim would be happy if you wrote him an e-mail telling himv you've mentioned Proto-Balto-Slavic protoforms he proposed in a public forum like Wiktionary ''without'' mentioning his name? Would you, if you were in his place? Maybe he thinks Wiktionary is "just internet" or "not trustworthy" and thus not worth the trouble, but I'm sure he wouldn't think that not mentioning his name is the right thing to do -- in fact, I'll bet he would mention this as an argument ''against'' taking Wiktionary seriously. Which in fact it is.
::'''(g)''': Maybe the pages should indeed be changed; two other Wiktionarians in the rfd discussion have already suggested that I myself "be bold" and edit and change them. I don't want to do that, though; but if you feel so strongly about it, why don't you? I do point out, though, that several others have said there is no official policy, so I'm not sure that there is a "what we do" yet: you seem to be placing the cart before the horses here. I think you still need to argue for "what YOU do" as being "what we should do". And frankly, I don't see how you can argue that not mentioning sources actually enhances Wiktionary. There is no self-respecting etymological dictionary that doesn't mention sources and doesn't label independent original research as such; why should Wiktionary?
::'''In sum''', if you don't have anything against sourcing, then remove the {{temp|rfd}} from a template that merely asks for what you say you have nothing against. If you are in favor of explaining reasons for particular reconstructions in the entries themselves, then do so. In fact create a framework for doing that, with a special page in the Wiktionary namespace for listing all correspondences, all sound laws, etc. so you can easily refer to them in the shorter explanations in every reconstructed entry. By all means ''do'' so! The problem thus far is that this is not being done, and when I started requesting that it be done ("source" = "published source" OR "original research rationale") you reverted all my changes and asked for my template to be deleted. Be consistent! Do as you claim to believe! --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:34, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:{{reply to|CodeCat}}, to summarize:
::It seems we agree in most things. We both think it's good to have sources if the information comes from an external source. We both think original research is OK, and we're both in favor of writing down the reasons for a certain reconstruction in the entry itself. I'm further in favor of you also mentioning yourself as the author of a given idea if indeed that is the case, or at least of referencing/copying the discussion that led to a given form being accepted here. So why not do it? And what is the problem with tagging the entries where this wasn't done yet? I also add {{temp|rfap}} to basically every new Latvian entry I make, because this puts them in a single category where Latvian native speakers like Neitrāls vārds can comfortably find the words they want to add pronunciation files to. Because, just as in the case of etymologies being sourced (and I don't mean only external sources), this actually adds value to the entry. Why not make this official Wiktionary policy?--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:46, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

:I don't accept the notion that we need to cite sources to list descendants; that would hobble us. Regular inheritance by a language of a word from an earlier stage of that language (including from a proto-language) is usually so obvious and non-noteworthy that it is not mentioned except for common words in well-documented languages, or for proto-language terms that an author needs to grasp at less-documented languages to demonstrate; [[good luck]] finding a reference that confirms, for any sizeable number of words from e.g. Rumantsch, that they indeed derive from Latin/PIE ''foobar''. Even borrowing may be obvious but unreferenced; no reference in {{m|en|supra}} confirms that the word derives from Georgian, but it's fairly obvious. <br />I do think the sheer ''existence'' of a word in a proto-language is something we need to provide a reference for, though if a reference attests that a certain word existed in a proto-language, I think we can and should certainly adapt that reference's potentially outdated notation; when I do this in Proto-Algonquian appendices I write <samp>source (has ''form'')</samp> (sometimes visibly and sometimes in an HTML comment). If no previous scholarship attests the existence of a word, we could put a template at the bottom of the entry (a bit like {{temp|LDL}} and {{temp|Webster}}) saying something like "this reconstruction is the product of deduction by Wiktionary editors"; users could then (as with every other claim on every non-talk-page) look to the page history to see who added what. Such a template would provide a nice way of tracking and periodically revisiting such entries to see if references for them had become available, since it seems to be obvious to everyone except CodeCat that citing external authority [[wrt]] the existence of words in proto-languages is better than leaving it at "well, a random, vehemently anonymous person on the internet thinks so". [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:15, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
:: {{reply to|-sche}} the problem here is simply when you have cognates proposed by different sources. Cognates can be sourced by default (they will mostly come from the same source anyway), without necessarily adding a footnote to each of them; but those who come from some other source will need to be footnoted, so that we are clear the source in question did not claim cognacy in this case. This applies even to words suggested as cognate by Wiktionarians: we could add a little superscript "W" to those, for example. This happens because "obvious" is not always true. French {{m|fr|parler}} looks like a cognate of Portuguese {{m|pt|falar}}, but it isn't. In fact, it's standard scientific practice: when you are presenting cognates, they must be either (a) sourced, or (b) your claim, or at least (c) be attested in some very well-known source, so they can be presented as "known to everybody already".--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 04:48, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I'm still being misunderstood here it seems. I do think that citing an external authority improves etymologies and reconstructions further. However, I don't think that reconstructions are necessarily less reliable without them. Sometimes, the reconstruction is just so obvious that there's nothing else it could possibly be. A great example is Proto-Finnic {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}}. It's exactly the same form as its ancestor and many of its descendants. If we can find sources that agree with our own ideas, then all the better, that just shows that we're not alone in thinking that. But the same applies to sources with respect to each other, too. If we have two sources that disagree with each other, then we can mention the idea from both of them. But we should also feel free to poke holes in these proposals. Maybe we (through [[WT:ES]] or a talk) could decide that one of them has more merit than the other, and we can mention our reasoning in the entry. As editors and researchers, we don't have to consider all sources equally valid. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:28, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
::: I think the misunderstanding is actually yours, about how science works. Yes, {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}} is maybe an obvious case, but it was not discovered by you or me. It has a proposer, and saying who it is is, I think, something an etymologist would be interested in. See, this is like saying we don't have to provide usage examples or definitions for words that "everybody knows". Yes, everybody knows what [[time]] and [[happy]] mean; yet Witkionary provides them with definitions. Is this useless? No. Is it useless to provide a source for {{m|<!--fiu-fin-->urj-fin-pro|*kala}}? Again, no. Just ask any scientist: is it useless to provide sources for 'obvious' things? No, both for credit/historical reasons (the guy who said it first deserves the credit), and for scientific reasons ('obvious' ideas sometimes turn out to be wrong...).  If the source is well-known ('everybody knows who proposed that'), then scientists will not mention the author (everybody knows the laws of gravitation were proposed by Sir Isaac Newton).
:::: Looking for "the proposer of" obvious etymologies is not a good idea. Finnic is a dialect continuum, and it has ''always'' been known by the speakers that people in nearby areas use plenty of the same words. This would be sort of like asking "who was it that proposed that ''fish'' in British English and ''fish'' in American English are cognate?" (Or: "who was it to discover that the moon has phases?")
:::: It's possible to do historiography on when does an etymology like this start turning up in scientific literature of course, but that's more constrained by the development of linguistic methodology and publication practices themself. {{temp|R:fi:SSA}} mentions appearences of ''kala'' spanning 350 years; the earliest inter-Finnic comparison found by them is Finnish ~ Estonian from 1786, followed by Karelian in 1799, Veps in 1830 (in the first linguistic report on Veps to be published), Votic in 1856 (in the first grammar of Votic to be written), etc. (There's no specific date on who was the first to claim that this is also a Proto-Finnic word; but if we grant modern theoretic understanding, this is already implied by the Finnish-Hungarian comparisons from the 17th century, so essentially the date would be as soon as someone came up with the concept of "Proto-Finnic" in the first place.)
:::: I agree that this is information that someone ''might'' be interested in, but just referencing SSA itself should be enough so that people interested in the history of etymology would know where to look for more details. At Wiktionary we're only working on etymology ''itself'', not its history. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 13:47, 9 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Indeed, I agree, especially because a source like SSA would probably give you the beginning of the trail leading to the first proponent if need be. I'm not saying that you need to find out the very first historical source ever to make the claim; but that, unless the claim is yours, some source should be indicated (so the interested reader can follow the trail). And it seems that we agree on that, right? (The "fish" in AE and BE case is not really parallel: I don't think these words were popularly believed to be cognates, but rather they were believed to be the same word, much as when I use "fish" as opposed to when you use "fish": we are using the same words, even if we pronounce them differently. Now, English "fish" and German "Fisch" or Dutch "vis": that is not perceived as the 'same word', and cognacy enters the picture.) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:20, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

== Transliterations in parentheses? ==

From the above discussion, it seems to me that most people want to keep the automatic transliteration of non-latin-script examples. Would it be possible to implement DTLHS's suggestion of putting the transliteration in parenthesis rather than after an em-dash, to distinguish it more clearly from the following translation? Could someone perhaps make the necessary changes in the appropriate module, assuming nobody has any objections? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]])

::What's wrong with brackets/parentheses? Transliterations on the headword line are in parentheses. Light grey text is hard for people with bad or limited eyesight (e.g. partial blindness) to read, although such people are probably only a tiny minority of our readers. I'd prefer parentheses to lighter text. I like the suggestion (made above) of putting transliteration on the same vs a different line according to the length of the line, but I guess it has no chance of actually corresponding to "fits on one line" vs "doesn't", given the variety of phone- and computer-screen sizes (unless we implement it is a css feature?).

:I support this and I don't see why anyone wouldn't. It's analogous to why we templatize headwords and such. Templatized foreign-script languages, for example, allow for automatic translit. And likewise, the format can be changed, either by the end user through CSS or by editing the template -- e.g. if we figure out how to automatically use CSS to decide whether to put such an example on one line or multiple lines, which should definitely be doable since things like Bootstrap (a CSS library released by Twitter) can do it.

Once before I started an "oppose having this vote" section on a vote, which garnered as much support as the vote itself; one could consider such an action if this vote is opened. (Side note, all the examples in the vote are English usexes, but I think it may be wise to consider English usexes — which don't need transliteration or translation — differently from foreign-language usexes.)

The wiki and template markup is the user interface and it matters a lot. The formatting instructions [[WT:ELE]] are a policy and cannot, in most circumstances, be edited without a vote. I oppose the use of ux and usex templates in English and Czech entries; it adds almost no value and makes the markup ugly to read. I never said so since I did not have the energy to do so; there are usually all to many things to discuss, in part since there are too many unnecessary changes being introduced by various editors without discussion.

:::# Generally it seems that the features of templates quickly become Luacized, which dramatically reduces the ability of more casual contributors like me to make changes, especially since there is no group of responsive technical contributors willing to respond to requests, rather than implement their own cryptic agendas.
:::# All benefit depends on either: 
:::## total implementation of a very capable (ergo, hard to develop successfully) template or 
:::## allowing user-option non-use of the template when it fails to provide good output by the person using the template, ie, some who knew or was willing to learn the switches etc.
::::But we do not even have consistent use of our existing format, which is almost certainly needed for successful mass conversion to the template approach. What steps have we taken to discover inconsistencies in formatting, to learn from them, and to either correct them or amend [[WT:ELE]]?
::::Our failure to successfully continue deployment of Autoformat worries me. The existing format-maintenance system seems to be a regression requiring much more manual involvement.
:::It would be much easier for me to accept changes if they did not make it harder for newer content contributors, did not require more typing, did not make editing harder by uglifying the edit frame, led to specific benefits that were achievable with reasonable certainty, and were implemented by a responsive group of technical contributors. Continued overtemplatization in areas for which we need ''more'' contributors, ie, definitions, usage examples, citations, seems approximately opposite to the direction we should go.

== Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-03/CFI: Removing usage in a well-known work 3 ==

Some people recently mentioned they missed [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-03/CFI: Removing usage in a well-known work 3]], despite the fact that the vote was opened for 5 months. Some of the people who missed it could have been [[User:Cloudcuckoolander]], [[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV]], and [[User:DCDuring]]. I would like to encourage such people to post ''late votes'', properly indented so that they do not count (e.g. <nowiki>#: Late '''oppose'''</nowiki>). We can't keep votes open forever, but we can continue to collect best evidence of consensus or its lack. Having a rationale accompanied with a late vote would would be very preferable, I think. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:13, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
:Thanks. Nevertheless, pinging for votes, even after-the-fact, looks like electioneering, a use of discretion that biases the process.

== Rare senses x rare forms ==

I have noticed that the parameter "rare" of the {{template|template:context}} categorizes entries into the [[:Category:Terms with rare senses by language]], while the parameter "uncommon" into the [[:Category:Rare forms by language]]. What is the difference between these two categories? Originally I thought that "rare forms" contains only forms of some lemma, which are rare (e. g. common Czech word "{{m|cs|pes||dog}}" has a common plural "psi", but rarely "psové" can be found too), but the real content of the category does not look so. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 00:19, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

:The fact that various rare, historical, dated, archaic{{,}} and obsolete things are categorized differently is due to (1) a desire to categorize terms with only obsolete/rare senses (like {{m|en|heleth}}) differently from terms which are still current/common in some senses (like {{m|en|land}}), combined with (2) the fact that categorizing such entries differently requires a lot of work (edits to entries, templates, etc), most of which has not been done yet. I think the ideal/plan/hope is that one day terms like {{m|en|heleth}} will be in [[:Category:English obsolete terms]] (I am not sure why [[:Category:English obsolete forms]] exists with the name and content it has; as you note, it should properly be used only for e.g. {{m|en|low}} as a form of {{m|en|laugh}}), while {{m|en|land}} et al will be in [[:Category:English terms with obsolete senses]].

== Retiring the codes of spurious languages ==

Moreover, the Ethnologue has not added any information to the language entry in nearly 40 years.

Barb Waugh, in an email dated 10 November 2009, responded to queries about Savara stating that she did not believe that the language existed at all.  She only knew Savara as an alternate name for Sora [srb], a Munda language. She pointed out that Ruhlen (1987) lists Savara as a Dravidian language.  Around the same time, Kirk Miller (UCSB) wrote questioning the existence of this language."

# ''myi'' Mina (India). See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-048.pdf ]. Neatly, retiring this will allow us to include ''hna'' Mina (Cameroon) without a disambiguator.
# ''pry'' Pray (aka "Pray 3", as Ethnologue called it because they just gave up on disambiguating it in any of their usual ways). This one is not strictly spurious; rather, it turns out to be no more than a duplicate of ''prt'' Prai (aka Pray). See [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-045.pdf the  change request form with data from recent field research].
# <s>''yos'' "Yos" was retired and merged it into ''zom'' "Zo", with [//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2012-035.pdf the change request] noting that Yos is simply the English plural of Yo which is no more than a variant form of Zo.</s> [has been removed from Wiktionary]

== About gloss parameter in term templates in all other sections, except etymology ==

I am not sure how helpful is a gloss in Derived and Related terms or even in Synonyms.
A term, as all words, may have many different senses. These can include a figurative one, a literal one etc.
The existence of a gloss definition in etymology section is usefull since possibly (but not always) only one sense is the specific one that "caused" the people to use the word (or phoneme). 
I came to these conclusions after {{ping|Saltmarsh}} [[User_talk:Xoristzatziki#RelatedDerived terms|pointed out]] that I should add some gloss definitions to my additions. I tried it for start, but there where some "mind" troubles when I had to add terms that have more than one wide used sense or more than one gender. Someone might say that in such cases do not add a gloss. But even if only one sense is wide used we "provoke" the rejection of all other senses that user may find in the article. --[[User:Xoristzatziki|Xoristzatziki]] ([[User talk:Xoristzatziki|talk]]) 06:05, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
:Synonyms should use {{temp|sense}}. Derived and related terms should specify a gloss but it can be of the form {{para|gloss|foo, bar, baz}} with multiple defns; doesn't have to be all possible senses but should be the principal ones. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:45, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::[I've been away] &nbsp; '''Reasoning''':  the gloss may be interesting/relevant and having it there saves the user linking through to find out. User [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] shows the syntax. &nbsp; '''Gender''': I think I would do this for multiple gender forms of different meaning:
::*{{l|el|φοοβάρος|gloss=foobar|g=m}}, {{l|el|φοοβάρος|gloss=cadscab|g=n}}<br>
::'''Idiomatic phrases''': I would normally link each term (do we want all of these with a separate entry) and these certainly need a gloss.&nbsp; &mdash; <span style="color:#1e90ff">[[User:Saltmarsh|Saltmarsh]]</span><sup><span style="color:#ff1493">[[User_talk:Saltmarsh|συζήτηση-talk]]</span></sup> 05:57, 15 August 2015 (UTC)
* Synonyms and Derived terms sections should not specify a gloss, by my lights. It is not only my preference but also a long-term overwhelming practice not to specify a gloss. Some people prefer glosses, obviously, but it is nowhere close to being a prescribed or recommended practice. Similarly, these sections should not provide gender, IMHO, but here the practice varies language by language. As for rationale, glosses make these sections too busy with information that is available elsewhere. Gender is okay as for being too busy or not, but is available in the lemma, and IMHO not so important that it should be available in term lists. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 17:42, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

== Allow Etymology as level 4 header ==

Me and some others (I don't know who, or where the discussion was) have expressed in the past a desire to have the etymology section nested under part-of-speech sections, rather than floating alongside them (both on level 3) or having the part of speech nested under the etymology. I think it makes more sense to put etymology underneath an individual word:

# Users generally look up terms for their definitions, etymology is of lesser importance overall. Therefore, it makes more sense to put it below the definitions.
# Etymology always applies to a single word and part of speech. If it happens to apply to multiple parts of speech, then the chances are that one of them was first, and the others were derived from that. That's something we can and should note in the etymologies of each individual part of speech.
# Having to increase the heading level whenever there are multiple etymologies is annoying. It also makes it look less consistent; sometimes POS is level 3, sometimes level 4? Level 5 headings are hard to distinguish visually from level 4, so I think level 4 should be the highest level we use.
# For non-lemma entries, we generally don't have or need etymologies, but we're forced to create etymology sections for them whenever there is another word in the entry. For example, {{m|en|rose|gloss=rise|pos=past}} needs an etymology header to separate it from the header for {{m|en|rose||flower}}, but the etymology section itself is left empty or doesn't have any useful information, because the etymology is at the lemma, {{m|en|rise}}.

So I'd like to ask/propose that etymologies be allowed to be nested underneath the POS header, as level 4. It would be added below the definitions, usage notes and inflection headers, but above synonyms, antonyms and derived/related terms. This is done in accordance with the general principle in our entry layout that information about the current term precedes information about relationships to other terms.

This proposal is intended as an indefinite trial, to let users who prefer this alternative format apply it to entries and evaluate its merits and problems. The original format will continue to be allowed as well, at least until there is a decision to phase it out. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:50, 12 August 2015 (UTC)

: "If it happens to apply to multiple parts of speech" -- isn't that overwhelmingly common? It would be tiresome to have ety sections repeated all over the place when they are basically the same word/sense. Do other dicts do that? [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 18:54, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I've not found it particularly common in the languages I've worked with, it's quite rare. Maybe English is just an exception. But this is why I'm not proposing to get rid of the old format just yet; we can still keep using it in situations that we haven't found alternatives for yet. That said, I think it's pretty easy to handle this with nested etymologies, as I noted in point 2. Just put the etymology on the term that was first, and the rest get etymologies saying they were derived from that first term. For example, {{m|en|up|pos=preposition}} is derived from {{m|en|up|pos=adverb}}, which our entry fails to note. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:01, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::: For many words, it might not be known which POS came first. Other dictionaries do not do this. They generally list all the parts of speech and give one etymology at the top or bottom of the entry (which sometimes mentions different derivations of specific senses of the word, is still in one section). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:12, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
::::"English is <u>just</u> an exception."  And also merely, technically the host language of this wiki.
::::No matter how many times this is proposed, it still seems like a bad idea. The structuring advantage of having semantically related terms that are different PoSes is enormous for English. Though it is not particularly helpful for one not familiar with large dictionaries, it is quite helpful once one get the hang of it. It is almost essential where there are homonyms both with, say, nouns as PoSes. Is it the proposal to combine all of the noun PoSes, no matter what the etymologies? We have spent a fair amount of effort trying to split etymologies where semantically warranted. To run the definitions through the blender as seems to be proposed seems like a regression. We may have come to accept them in technical areas as people abandon the project and their creations lapse, but I don't see why they should be allowed in content.

:::::::* To clarify my concern about merging POS bits, I'm not talking about nouns and verbs being thrown together.  Instead, I'm concerned about terms that have multiple senses of a single POS type, and where those separate senses have different etymologies.  If the etymology header is made subordinate to POS, then things get confusing pretty quickly.  Consider the Japanese entry at {{m|ja|柄}}, for instance.  This term has nine different noun senses, all with distinct etymologies (and eight distinct pronunciations even).  The proposed structure of an <samp>====Etymology====</samp> header at level 4, under a <samp>===Noun===</samp> header at level 3, would make this entry a complete mess.  ‑‑&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 18:07, 14 August 2015 (UTC)
: See {{diff|34038360}} for an example of how I think etymologies should be handled. Each POS has its own etymology, including (especially) forms of another lemma. Two different lemmas can't possibly have the same etymology, because after all, if they have the same development history, why are they still different?
: As for Eirikr's entry above, I'm not really seeing the issue. The entry already has one etymology section for each POS, so all that would be left to do is to switch the headers around. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:09, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
:* [[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]], have another look.  As visible in the page's TOS, some single etymologies cover multiple POSes -- noun and prefix, noun and suffix.
:: In addition, I still don't quite understand your proposed layout.  Further up the thread, it ''sounds'' like all nouns would go together under a single <samp>===Noun===</samp> header -- which then leaves me wondering how the disparate etymologies would be accounted for.  Even if your intention is to have as many <samp>===Noun===</samp> headers as there are etymologies, this produces a strange circumstance where we are organizing higher-level headers in a way that's dependent on lower-level headers.  Just in terms of hierarchical organization, that seems backwards.
:: And that still doesn't account for the case where an entry has multiple etymologies, and some of those etymologies apply to multiple POSes.  Numerous Japanese terms have a single spelling, with multiple POSes under a single etym and pronunciation.  Fewer, but still numerous, entries have multiple separate etymologies, each etym with its own pronunciation and possibly multiple POSes.
:: Would you be willing to edit the {{m|ja|柄}} entry into your proposed structure, as you did for {{diff|34038360|text=''dice''}}?

* I agree that conlangs should be handled separately from reconstructed terms. In contrast to how we handle proto-languages, our current approach to conlangs actually ''is'' fairly well suited to the appendix namespace, in that we have one page (one appendix, total) on each conlang. '''However''', most of them are constant copyvio magnets, since we can only allow short appendices, but the inclusion of any appendix at all tempts people to expand said appendix: see e.g. [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Quenya&action=history] ([[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2014/July#Inclusion_of_Dothraki|BP discussion of copyright issues]]). I wouldn't mind deleting most of them, perhaps moving a few (''de minimis'') words into our mainspace entries on the ''names'' of the conlangs, using {{temp|examples-right}}, like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=L%C3%A1adan&type=revision&diff=33838599&oldid=33838581 this].

Notational systems for protolangs vary greatly, and this could imply a senseless amount of repetition of "Alternate spelling of…" sections in the future. The basic object of protolang pages is an ''etymological group'', not the graphical representation of its proto-form, per se.<br/>In fact I could suggest that the new namespace be named simply ''Etymology:'', and that it could include appendix pages tracing the descendants of attested words just as well (a la [[Appendix:Names derived from Marcus]]). --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 14:10, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== Eskayan ==

Last year, the ISO approved the code ''[//www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=esy esy]'' for Eskayan. Should we follow suit, and if so, should we allow it in the main namespace? It's technically a conlang from the early 1900s, but it comes with a mythology that claims it's much older and it functions as a medium for recording traditional stories (both in Roman script and in a native script which lacks a ISO 15924 code). It has no native speakers but a few hundred secondary speakers and a few schools to teach it. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:50, 14 August 2015 (UTC)

:I've added it to [[Module:languages]]. It is spoken by a few hundred people, and schools teach it and literature is published in it and has been for almost a century, so I suppose it is allowed in the main namespace like Esperanto. Its creator intended it for widespread use (by his ethnic group) and attributed it to his tribe's mythical ancestor rather than to himself, and then he (the actual creator) died in 1949, so as far as copyright concerns go, it seems similar to e.g. Esperanto and different from e.g. Dothraki. Shall we update [[WT:CFI#Constructed_languages]] to note the existence and inclusion of Eskayan, or is that not necessary because the ISO doesn't categorize ''esy'' as a constructed language, and it does not itself admit that it is one (even though it is identifiable as such by linguists)?

== Notes as a valid L3 (esp. along References) ==

<small>Copied from a related discussion, for separate discussion. (Link removed from sig not to ping unintentionally.) [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 06:50, 17 August 2015 (UTC)</small>

As I see it, a discussion on '''allowing "Notes" as a valid header''' should be considered.

Vahag has brought this up ([[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#.7B.7Breflist.7D.7D]]) and I'm running into a similar problem all the time. As ridiculously silly of an argument as it may be, I do, in fact, agree that numbered and bulleted references together look ugly AF. (I have even went to such ridiculous steps as removing a reference that didn't add anything critical just because it was bulleted while the other ones were numbered because of how unappealing it looks.)

In more general terms, I kind of get the feeling that there seems to be consensus that references are in fact valuable and add value to the entry, perhaps the discussion should focus more on how to allow more elegant ways of faithfully citing content, particularly in "controversial" cases, e.g., obviously one bulleted reference is enough under, say, an assertion that et {{m|et|kala}} and liv {{m|liv|kalā}} derive from the same source because, well, it's pretty obvious but then if there is a "weird" controversial cognate there isn't even a way of citing it inline (unless you want the awful looking mixing of numbered and bulleted refs.)

** IMO this makes little sense. You basically think people should never create references sections listing refs; that's an impossible standard to meet and often way too awkward. In my Arabic entries that I add, I routinely add a "References" section under each part-of-speech entry listing the books where I got the entry definitions from. There's no simpler way of doing it, since the reference really does refer to the POS section as a whole in most cases. And many languages do this. So we really do need Notes and References separate.

*** IMO you're confused as to what's being proposed which probably goes back to the original discussion's misunderstanding of Wikipedia's #Notes section. #Notes (as the name implies) are for actual notes; they are not for references of any sort. #References are for both generated inline references (what's being called numbered references here) and bibliographic lists.

*'''Oppose'''. I also oppose the notion (expressed by some above) that all references need to use ref tags. In particular, because Wiktionary has a longstanding practice, which I support, of not cite other dictionaries inline for definitions, but Wiktionary does allow other dictionaries ("mentions") to [[WT:ATTEST|verify]] words in many languages, there will always be many entries which have references which apply to the whole entry, as Benwing notes. I personally don't find a mix of bulleted and numbered citations problematic, but if you do, a solution like the one deployed on [[բալախ]] is preferable to a new section which, I agree with Llywelyn, is unnecessary and also apparently misunderstanding what Wikipedia uses ==Notes== for (hint: not references, but actual clarificatory notes, which often don't cite references). Practically speaking, the continued use of "related terms" by new users to mean "semantically related" when it actually is for "etymologically related", and the only very slight distinction that is proposed to be made between ==References== and ==Notes==, convinces me that only a few veteran adepts would use ==Notes== correctly, and other people would either not use it "correctly" vis-a-vis ==References==, or fill it up with trivia. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 15:16, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
** But those are completely different things. There's references ("see here for more") and sourcing ("we got this information from here"). Mixing them into the same references section is bad. I have no problem with listing external reference works, but treating them as ''sources'' or mixing them in with sources is very bad. External reference works should, surely, go in the "external links" section, the "references" section should be kept for sourcing only. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:06, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

== Nouns mostly used in plural - redirection to singular ==

I see reduction of content going on in nouns often used in plural, via soft redirection to singular forms. That includes [[crocodile tears]], [[savings]], and [[scrambled eggs]]. This seems inferior to me and I would like to refert. We should IMHO host the definitions in the most common form, and if the most common form is the plural, we should host it in plural. What do you think? Anyone has a link to a previous discussion? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:10, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

:One concern I expressed in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/August#Template:in_the_plural|this previous discussion]] (see also [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2013/December#Entries_that_mix_form-of_definitions_and_lemmas|this one]]) was that most people are able to figure out when a word is plural even if they can't tell what it means, and will look up the base form (e.g. ''foobar'', if what they see in the text is "the foobars are blah"), so unless there is some explicit and obvious notice that additional senses are to be found in the plural's entry, readers may never think to look there. <br />If ''all'' senses are most common in the plural, I agree that the plural should be the lemma, with the singular using [[Template:singular of]] or a similar template. If only some senses are most common in the plural, I think it's more helpful to the reader to have them all in one place with appropriate labels (like "chiefly plural"). I could live with splitting them, though, as long as there were explicit, obvious notices to readers that they need to look in the other entry for more senses. (I don't think bare [[Template:singular of]] as an additional definition-line after some substantive definitions makes it sufficiently obvious that there's more ''semantic'' information to be found in the plural, but [[Template:singular of]] with a gloss specified might work.)

:: The way I see it, there is one and only one lemma entry (one with definitions, inflection, -nyms, etc) per lemma. A single lemma should not have more than one lemma entry. So either these should all be concentrated on a single lemma page, as our normal practice is with respect to lemmas and non-lemmas, or we should treat them as separate lemmas entirely and keep them completely separate. I have done this with some entries as well, such as {{m|en|dialectics}} and {{m|en|darts}}. Note that in the former case I made sure to split the etymology as well, as different lemmas always have different etymologies. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:20, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
::: We also need to establish some limit for how much more common the plural is.

== What to call plural noun lemmas? ==

We have the template {{temp|en-plural noun}} to categorise nouns whose lemma is grammatically plural. But this template also categorises in [[:Category:English pluralia tantum]]. Is every noun that is used primarily in the plural a plurale tantum? I'm thinking a better category name would be [[:Category:English plural nouns]] or [[:Category:English plural-only nouns]]. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 14:28, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:Very many "plural only" nouns can be found to be attested in the singular, eg [[scissor]]. It would, IMO, be misleading to eliminate the category for this reason, but it means that we need a good explanation in the category header. If we have a good explanation, we don't need to worry as much about the category name. I think what users need to know is not that the lemma is plural in form, but whether it is more commonly ("correctly") used ("agrees") with a singular or plural verb. I think this is an empirical question for many such terms, rather than something that follows from the categorization. I wonder whether the category shouldn't be hidden and the "plural-only" display replaced with something that focused on the agreement issue. As a hidden category it would retain its usefulness in directing contributors to reviewing the entries to determine whether they adequately and correctly addressed the agreement issue.

::: With such nouns that do have a singular, we have to ask what the singular actually means. For the derivation singular > plural it's easy, it is simply multiple of a thing. For plural > singular, if the plural form clearly does refer to multiple objects, then I'd reason that it should simply be a non-lemma and the singular is the lemma. But for plural nouns that are not clearly multiple instances of something, it's more difficult. "Scissors" is a single object, so a hypothetical singular form doesn't have a predictable meaning. What is a "scissor"? Saying it's the singular of "scissors" doesn't actually make it clear what it is. So I think that we should evaluate cases where the singular parameter of this template has been specified. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:00, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

== Guidance requested on religious terminology ==

'''Quaker terms''' I would like to make entries or a listing for Quaker-related terminology, as some of it is very particular but I'm not sure if it belongs in the main body of the dictionary or an appendix or what-have-you. For instance, Quakers traditionally didn't refer to the days of the week by their common pagan-derived names but used "first day" for Sunday, "second day" for Monday, etc. I could easily imagine someone reading about a "Friend going to meeting-house on first day" and not realizing that this means a "Quaker going to church on Sunday". Should I create entries for all of these terms or simply something like [[Appendix:Quaker terminology]]?

== French French, Spanish Spanish and the like ==

This came up [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Category:Spanish_Spanish|tangentially in May]], but I'd like to raise it in its own thread. Currently, most regional categories are named "[place-adjective] [language]", as in "[[:Category:French French|French French]]", "[[:Category:Welsh English|Welsh English]]" and "[[:Category:Austrian German|Austrian German]]", while a minority are named "[place-noun] [language]", as in "[[:Category:Louisiana English|Louisiana English]]" (not *"Louisianan English") and "[[:Category:Quebec French|Quebec French]]". <br /> I and some others find "French French" (and also to some extent "Welsh English") awkward and confusing, because it's easy to interpret both instances of "French" (and "Welsh") as referring to a language rather than a place. The "[place-adjective] [language]" scheme is also impossible or undesirable for some languages: "Swiss German" was felt [by some people, not me] to be so similar to the name of the Swiss German ''language'' [which Wiktionary calls Alemannic] that its category was moved to "[[:Category:Switzerland German|Switzerland German]]", and it's currently impossible to distinguish French terms specific to the [[DRC]] from those specific to the [[ROC]], because both go in "[[:Category:Congolese French|Congolese French]]". OTOH, "Austrian German" and most other category names are fine.<br /> I propose we move all the reduplicated categories (like "French French") to either the "France French" format some categories already use, or to a format like "French of France". (Should we move ''all'' categories, including "Austrian German", etc, to one of those formats? It'd be consistent, but unnecessary in most cases.) [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:05, 20 August 2015 (UTC)

== Get rid of the parentheses around inflections in headword lines ==

Instead of putting parentheses there, I'm thinking it might look cleaner to separate the inflections with an m-dash or something similar. Something like this:

An advantage is that it looks nicer when you put qualifiers or transliterations there. Those features aren't used much, but they are available.

== The dot before the first transliteration on some entries' headword lines ==

The thread above this prompted me to look closely at how headword-lines are formatted, and it strikes me that having a dot before only the first transliteration on only the headword line of only some entries creates an awkward and inconsistent amount of space. For example, in [[буква]]: why should "(búkva)" be further away from "бу́ква" than it is from "f inan"? and why should "(búkva)" be further away from "буква" than "(''Latin spelling'' žagati)" is from "жагати" in [[[[жагати]]]], or than "(''romaji'' aizōban)" is from "[[あいぞうばん]]" in that entry? The dot is especially awkward in entries like {{m|ar|حَدُثَ}}, where the headword-line goes on to give another word and its translit, and the second translit is ''not'' separated by a dot. I propose we eliminate the dot. <br /> I know that for the tiny number of languages which have <samp>WT:_ transliteration</samp> pages, the dot serves as an easter egg for the tiny number of people who notice that it contains a link. The link could either be moved to the transliteration itself, i.e. <samp>бу́ква ([[Wiktionary:Russian transliteration|búkva]])</samp>, or just omitted because a nearly unnoticeable link that only exists for a few languages and points to a page that's frankly not very useful is, well, not so useful that it needs to stay... I mean entries don't even normally link to <samp>WT:About _</samp> pages AFAIK, and those are frequently more useful. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 08:30, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
: I was one of the proponents and spreaders of the "dot" format, but recently I changed my mind for the reasons you give. I now think it should be removed altogether. --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 11:07, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== [[User:Pereru]] and sources again ==

This user has started adding all kinds of templates like {{temp|needsources}} and {{temp|needref}} to entries again. These templates don't serve a purpose as there is no strict need for sources. You can't ask for sources if there aren't any.

More annoyingly, the user is now also preventing me from editing and fixing up etymologies, reasoning that I may only write what agrees with the source. This is complete nonsense; if sources restrict what edits Wiktionarians may make, then the sources need to go. Or better yet, the users need to stop doing that and let editors do their work. If sources prevent me from improving Wiktionary, I'm going to start removing them. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:39, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:The template {{temp|needsources}} was kept, as in the decision above, and is believed to be useful. Adding it to an entry does not change any of its contents, it merely points out that there are no sources and that it would be an improvement to add them. If there are no sources, add a rationale -- the template says so. If you want, we can talk about how to do that. But adding information that is based on something -- even original research -- wihtout mentioning its source or rationale -- that is in no way an improvement.
:Ahn... Please don't misrepresent me. What I'm saying is that etymologies cannot float in the vacuum. If you don't have a source to add, add a rationale. You often do a quick'n'dirty one in the edit summary -- why not add a better one to the text itself?
:I insist: '''I am not preventing you from fixing etymologies: I merely think that, by letting them float in the air, you're making them worse'''. Ground your etymologies, and I'll have no problem with what you do. Please, don't misrepresent what I say.--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:45, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Why is a rationale needed? Specify which parts of an etymology are in doubt. Or better yet, take it to [[WT:ES]]. Putting a template on the entry solves nothing at all. The template itself needs a rationale just as much for it to be useful.
::: Because the reader is not a Wiktionarian. He's not trying to discuss etymologies. He wants to know what the jist is of the reason why this form is here rather than some other form. He is not a critic: he just wants to know ''how Wiktionary decided that this was the right form''. It's information, it's relevant, it should be on the page. Why is this even a problem? Are you trying to hide something?
:: I'm also not amused by your continued stance against Balto-Slavic. Balto-Slavic is accepted and has consensus among linguists, yet whenever I add it to an entry you put brackets around it and add "perhaps", while keeping your own Baltic-only etymologies displayed prominently. Wiktionary is not here to promote your fringe anti-Balto-Slavic views. We should show the current state of research. I think if you continue to exclude Balto-Slavic or play down its relevance or acceptance, then you should stop editing etymologies altogether. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:07, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Not the linguists I've talked to, no. But even if it were a consensus -- I don't have a problem with you adding Proto-BS to Wiktionary. I have a problem with you not ''arguing'' for the forms (same for Proto-IE, by the way). If you've invented them yourself, say so and state why. Why is this so difficult? If you're proposing a hypothesis, ''justify it'' on the page! If it's an argument that is generally valid for many words, write it up somewhere and link to it on the page! The "perhaps" there is meant to show that there is no reason for that form ''given here in Wiktionary'' -- if you add a reason, a justification for that form, then I'll be happy to delete any hedges.
::: Let me turn the argument against you: Wiktionary is also not here to support your anti-source, anti-rationale agenda. Being against sources and insisting on hiding the reasons why you choose one specific protoform when there are other in the literature and when there often is disagreement among Wiktionarians (see Štambuk and you on Kim vs. the Leiden school) does not make anything better here -- it arguably makes things worse. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:15, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: And yet, you refuse to explain anything at all about the problems ''you'' have with etymologies. [[WT:ES]] exists for a reason, why don't you use it? That's the place for discussing etymologies. ''Discuss'' what's wrong with them. If you find them implausible, then say ''why'' in the discussion. Just putting "perhaps" and a bunch of templates doesn't solve any of that. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:22, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: That's because I don't ''have'' any specific problems with the forms in question; I just want to see what the reasons are for their having been chosen. And I keep not understanding why wanting to see this is strange, and why you're so determined to hide it. Again: it's not about ''discussing'', it's about ''documenting''. It's like adding sources to quotations. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:34, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: Yes, and which reasons are unclear? What needs explaining? Specify which aspects of the etymology are unclear and need explanation. And don't say "all of it" because that would make no sense; not a single etymological source explains ''everything'' about an etymology. The reader is always assumed, by every work, to have an understanding of the linguistics. What etymological sources do is they explain special parts of the etymology that may be surprising or unexpected, or aspects of a language's development that are unknown or not fully consensus. So you need to specify which parts of the etymology are unclear and need motivating.
::::::: I need to see the rationale in order to tell you if I think there is something wrong about it. Just as I need to see the definition of a word to see if I think it's wrong. A word without a definition is not useful in a dictionary. An etymology without a source or rationale is just floating in space, it is a speculation of its author. This should be obvious. Ask yourself: why is it that every good etymological dictionary known to man has both sources and justifications for the protoforms it lists? Are they really all wrong in doing that?
:::::: Also, aside from all of this, you do realise that all this applies to you as well? You'll have to give motivations in all your etymologies as well. ''Especially'' the ones that promote Baltic while dismissing Balto-Slavic. Fringe and unusual ideas should always be subject to higher scrutiny. So if you have a particular reason for going against the majority view that Balto-Slavic is a real thing, then you will have to explain this ''and'' why this view should be preferred in Wiktionary etymologies. Because I don't think there is a consensus for excluding or minimising Balto-Slavic. It has more support among linguists than Baltic does. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:43, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::: Of course I realize that. That's what I've been doing from the start. Every single etymology I have added has (a) a source and (b) a motivation/rationale. They are just not ''mine''; they are Konstantīn Karuli's. You may disagree with them, and you are free to argue or counterargue (justifying and sourcing your arguments); and if indeed they proceed, then you win. What is the problem with that?
::::::: I'm all in favor of scrutiny! My entire point is that ''you provide no scrutiny''. You just carry out your decisions without giving good reasons, and every time you're called on that, you just say something like "I don't need to justify my preferences". Well, you do. Please, do some scrutinizing. And '''write it down''' for other to see and scrutinize, too! Your distaste for justifications and/or sources is the fringiest idea I've seen: I don't know a single person interested in historical linguistics who supports that, including the other Wiktionarians here. It's only '''you''', CC. You're the fringe one here, the one who needs scrutinizing. Please accept that. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 13:36, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

== Sources, despite [[User:CodeCat]] ==
Frankly, here is my personal approach to this. If anyone (except CodeCat, who really isn't impartial about this issue) thinks I'm wrong, please let me know.

* I think sources <u>and/or rationales</u> (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) make etymologies more trustworthy, because they show to that Wiktionary has done its homework and allow the more educated user to check whether or not s/he agrees with Wiktionary (this is especially important when an etymology is Wiktionary's own).
* Sources <u>and/or rationales</u> (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) are easy to add: if you're copying the info from somewhere, write down where from. If you're creating it yourself, write down why this is better.
* If an entry doesn't have sources '''and/or rationales''' (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason), then it's OK to add a template that says so, so that those who are interested can take care of it. It's not different from templates like {{temp|rfap}}, which I also use extensively to encourage Latvian speakers to add audio pronunciation files.

What is wrong about any of the above? And in what way does any of the above prevent anyone from working?

CodeCat and I have been reverting each other's edits for a few minutes. I will no longer do that -- it's more than a bit childish -- but I will leave here my request that something be done about it. This page is a discussion forum where such problems can hopefully be resolved. Let us talk about that, then, and come to some sort of conclusion, so that we can finally go on doing things without sudden tantrums from our estimated colleagues. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:03, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

*CodeCat, I think previous discussions have made abundantly clear that the only person here who thinks there is no need for reconstructions to have some kind of reference is you. Given that fact, it would be wise of you to stop edit-warring {{temp|needsources}} (which was RFD-kept per consensus) out of entries. Let's start working on a template or format for presenting "Wiktionarian research" / "rationales" on entries which lack scholarly references. For reconstructions based on known sound correspondances, perhaps we could document the sound correspondances on an 'About' page (or similar page) and then have a template that says "Reconstructed by Wiktionary according to [[foobar-link|known sound correspondences]]" which could be placed in the references section or at the bottom of the entry {{temp|Webster}}- and {{temp|LDL}}-style. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:08, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
** The issue I have is that these templates are telling me to add references and sources. There aren't any, so I remove the template. What point is there in asking for something that doesn't exist? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:11, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
*** The template says ''sources '''and/or rationales'''''. If there is no source, add a rationale. Are you claiming the rationales also don't exist? Supposedly you haven't been picking protoforms randomly... have you? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:20, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
*** (e/c) The template explicitly asks for either pre-existing scholarly sources, or what it currently calls "original research" (that wording and the format it prescribes need to be improved, but the meaning is clear). On Wikipedia and some other Wiktionaries, like de.Wikt, you would be blocked if you kept adding original etymological research. We're offering you a big concession, a big compromise — you get to keep adding your OR (whereas newer users even on this wiki have been threatened with blocks, as recently as last week, for adding OR etymologies), but you have to provide your rationales for it — for each reconstruction you invent. If you aren't willing to do that, previous discussions have made clear that there are quite a few people who would be happy to simply delete and ban all etymological OR. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:23, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
**** You're making it sound like there's this big change that has to be made to allow unsourced etymologies. But it's just the status quo. So I keep doing what has always been done, as there hasn't been a policy change. Don't make it sound like a concession because it isn't. If you want to require sources for all etymologies, '''make a policy and enforce it''' (which would mean removing somewhere around 90% of all etymology sections and reconstructions). That's all I ask for. Until then, you need to be clearer about what's wrong with the etymologies. Just asking for sources and rationales is going to get ignored. Pereru can patrol his fringe etymologies all he wants, that's fine with me. Latvian is not my responsibility. As long as I can make sure the rest of Wiktionary is up to par. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:31, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
***** Previous discussions have made abundantly clear that you are the only person who subscribes to the view that reconstructions are not required to have any sources.

@Pereru ''And since nobody disagreed, I suppose this means we have a policy?'' From what I gather CC insists that a lack of voted-on, explicit policy negates the fundamental clause that "Wiktionary is a secondary source" (which means that wikt allows some elements of synthesis but the synthesized sources still need to be cited.)

Anyways, can this be a thing? In case I disappear I would like to document my '''support''' of a potential policy requiring sources, including for synthesis [e.g., "''bebe'' could be considered derived from ''baba'' because source X says that ''ebe'' is derived from ''aba''" and so forth, the keyword here being ''source X''.] [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 21:51, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

== Is [[User:CodeCat]]'s behavior a problem? ==
I have personally nothing against CodeCat's work, which is excellent in many areas of Wiktionary. But his/her behavior with respect to sourcing and providing support for his/her etymological choices are causing increasing concern. Despite the majority view that {{template|needsources}} was useful, and that sources '''and/or rationales''' (CodeCat always forgets this part, for some reason) improve an entry (just like audio pronunciations do, which is why there are templates like {{template|rfap}}), CodeCat is doing his/her damndest to make this particular part of the job -- selecting the entries that need this improvement, and then going about doing it -- irritatingly difficult. Again, I have nothing against all other contributions by CodeCat, who, as far as I know, is a good person. I'm not against the person, I'm against the behavior, which, as I think most people agree, is not justified.<br>
In view of that, is there some adminsitrative procedure here that can be undertaken to deal with such cases of irrational behavior? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:51, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
: I have a problem with Pereru ignoring the consensus agreed upon in BP just this month, to make Proto-Baltic an etymology-only language. Pereru continues to create Proto-Baltic pages and categories, even going so far as to undo page moves. This needs to stop and I would like to know if there is some administrative procedure that can take care of this irrational behaviour. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:02, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

* But still, guys: CodeCat is imposing a policy that was never approved, that clearly goes against what the majority here wants, that goes against written recommendations like [[Wiktionary:Etymology#References]]; s/he also goes on a tantrum whenever anyone opposes that and takes unmeasured punishing actions such as his/her recent attempt to block me. And yet nobody does anything against it. What is the problem? Why does Wiktionary allow such destructive behavior?

== Czech possessive adjectives - etymology and related terms ==

First off, the term "Czech possessive adjective" does not find much use but I do not find a better one. Czech possessive adjectives would be the likes of [[orlův]] (eagle's) from [[orel]] (eagle). They are much like English possessive forms that we do not include for the reason that the apostrophe makes them effectively sum of parts; that is not the case with the Czech forms. In Czech, there is still a distinction between [[orlův]] and [[orlí]]; the latter would be used in the translation for "eagle's nest".

Now, how to treat them as for '''etymology and related terms'''?. I want that entries for them do not repeat the etymology of the base term, and I want to see no "Related terms" section. I prefer that they be treated a bit like items in [[:Category:Latin participles]]. In this, I seem to differ from [[User:Jan.Kamenicek]].

A possessive adjective is created for great many animate nouns, most often referring to humans but also sometimes to animals. They include matčin (and forms matčina, matčino), otcův, sestřin, bratrův, synův, orlův, etc. They are not to be confused with koní, orlí, kočičí, psí, člověčí, etc.

I am asking for input from other people. I am looking forward to getting a view from other languages that have a similar feature, maybe Russian and other Slavic languages, but also other languages. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:38, 23 August 2015 (UTC)

:The term "Czech possessive adjective" does not find much use because there are not many English books dealing with them. The term "Czech hard adjectives" seems to find even less use, but they do exist. It is also not easy to filter them out, because not all books dealing with Czech possessive adjectives use the phrase "Czech possessive adjectives", they can talk simply about Czech language and use only the phrase "possessive adjectives" (such as here: [https://books.google.cz/books?id=EdjXAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false]).
:I believe that all the expressions like {{m|cs|orel}}, {{m|cs|orlice}}, {{m|cs|orlí}} or {{m|cs|orlův}} should be listed in the categories like [[:Category:Czech terms derived from Proto-Slavic]] and therefore their etymology sections should include information that they "come from  {{cog|sla-pro|*orьlъ}}", which also puts it into the correct category.
:As for the "eagle's nest": it can be translated in both ways (depending on context) as ''orlí hnízdo'' (talking about the kind of nest), or ''orlovo hnízdo'' (nominative neuter of ''orlův'') The latter is used quite rarely, usually when referring to a nest belonging to a specific eagle, but examples when it is used as a synonym for "orlí" can be also found (usually in poetry or in old texts, one of them is in the quotation in the entry {{m|cs|orlův}}).

::My preferred format is like this {{m|mdf|нилеце}}, which seems to be what Dan Polansky is suggesting (the term "sub-lemma" comes to mind.) Just my "2 cents." [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 14:25, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
:::I think that words categorized as lemmas should be treated as lemmas. Either it is a lemma, or it is not. I do not think that e. g.

It is an adjective derived from ''orel'' by a suffix [[-ův]], which is a ''derivational'' suffix, not an ''inflectional'' suffix. --[[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 17:08, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Maybe possessive adjectives should be ranked as non-lemmas, along with Latin participles and Czech comparatives ([[menší]]). It would be consistent with the practice of PSJC and SSJC. But I do not think it obvious that there should only be lemmas and non-lemmas, and that's it. For instance, many editors prefer to create some entries as ''alternative forms'', and prefer to centralize etymology in the main entry and avoid it in the alternative form. The alternative form is still a lemma, but it is a secondary entry from the standpoint of information management. I have even seen some editors use the word "lemma" to mean "main entry" rather than "the word form representing all the inflected forms of the word".
:::: The question is, like, do we want to repeat the etymology of [[huge]] in [[hugely]], and do that for the whole class of -ly adverbs? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 17:24, 23 August 2015 (UTC)

:Was ''orlův'' separate from ''orel'' in Proto-Slavic, or was it only formed in Czech? If it was only formed in Czech, then I agree with Dan and Neitrāls: just say how it's derived from ''orel'' and put the history of ''orel'' in that entry. Just because something is its own lemma doesn't mean we have to duplicate (knowing it will come unsynced) information in multiple entries; ''[[rigidify]]'' is its own lemma independent of ''[[rigid]]'', but doesn't repeat ''rigid''’s etymology. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:12, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
::Generally speaking, possessive adjectives appeared already in Proto-Slavic, see [[Appendix:Proto-Slavic/-ovъ]]. The possessives with the suffix *-ovъ changed in Proto-Czech (between 10th and 13th century) to -óv and later -uov, which changed into modern -ův.
::Unlike huge x hugely, there are often more changes taking place when creating Czech possessives than adding the suffix, compare e. g. [[Radka]] x Radčin.
::Besides this, I think that all words which have roots in proto-languages, should be listed in the categories like Terms derived from Proto-... . I don't think that only one representant of a group of related words should be listed there. Using the {{template|template:etyl}} in the etymology section is a good way to do so. Or should the category be added manually? [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan Kameníček]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 21:01, 23 August 2015 (UTC)
::: The fact that going from "matka" to "matčin" does not look like plain suffixing does not matter; it is the property of Czech morphology (inflectional and derivational alike) that it often does not work like plain suffixing on the surface level. For instance, "bedna" --> "bednář" = "bedna" - "a" + "ář"; "samec" --> "samčí"; "vyrobit" --> "výrobce" = "vyrobit" - "it" + "ce" with "y" made acute or the like; "dům" --> "domeček" (ů went to o); "orel" --> "orlíček" (e dropped); "hrdlo" --> "hrdelní"; etc.
::: What matters is that we are dealing with a very productive derivation or inflection pattern, like in English for -ly, -ness, -hood, -ify, -ing, etc. And what matters is whether we want to have etymologies like the one currently in [[orlův]], which says this:<p> "From orel + -ův. Noun orel comes from Proto-Slavic *orьlъ, which is from Proto-Indo-European *h₃er- (“big bird, eagle”).[1]"</p><p> As you can see, the etymology first indicates the suffixing, and then goes into detailing the etymology of the component "orel". That is really like "swimming" detailing the etymology of "swim", and "merrily" detailing the etymology of "merry".</p>
::: Whether possessives ''in general'' originated early or not does not seem to matter. What matters is the particular etymology, and whether it is of the form "base + suffix. Base is from base-etymology" rather than what we see e.g. in [[windmill]], which could conceivably be "wind + mill", but can in fact be traced to Old English *windmylen. I do not think that ''all compounds'' should provide the etymologies of the component terms on the pages of the compounds. Put in general terms, I do not think that all etymologies of all terms resulting from derivation (prefixing, suffixing, compounding, etc.) should repeat the etymologies of their base terms. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:10, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

== Question (re: sourcing) ==

So, there was this thing that I wanted to get a feel of the general attitude.

Do passages/statements attributed to an author or a book need to actually reflect what the author/book says? Can they be changed ("corrected") with something that author doesn't say while still attributing it to them?

My answer would probably be "are you effing kidding me?" (lol) Then again en.wikt can be a serious "land of the bent mirrors" [don't remember the correct idiom] and things that I see as common sense some others don't even consider.

This is referring to a discussion 3 headers up (that I actually missed) where (to sum it up somewhat snarkily) CodeCat says that that book is stupid and needs her corrections while still proudly displaying the reference [1] at the end despite (in some cases) all the core information being changed. For example in {{m|lv|akmens}} the direct parent root was changed, then extrapolating from that the proto-group was changed and a different PIE root introduced (none of these things are to be found in the source cited.) I call this manufactured references/misattribution but maybe I'm dumb...?

Would like others' input.

And more generally this thing has been lingering on for years, the crux of the matter is that CC demands an explicit, voted-on policy, why not just do it, it could be something very simple, something to the effect:
*Wiktionary by previous consensus is a secondary source, this explicitly applies to etymologies, sources need to be provided, in case of synthesis, the synthesized works need to be attributed.
**Usage of templates to keep track of unsourced pages is to be encouraged.
**Attribution of statements to an author that they didn't make is to be avoided.

What do you think about that? Perhaps [[User:Dan Polansky]] could help set it up? [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 14:57, 23 August 2015 (UTC)

: As for ''policy page'', the main thing is ''consensus'' and ''evidence of consensus'', IMHO. A policy page by itself is a poor evidence of consensus; it merely makes things convenient for newcomers who then do not need to wade through previous votes to find what the decision was. Thus, a policy page is not strictly necessary, IMHO.

== Recreating Proto-Baltic (and other "deprecated" languages) with a different status? ==
Proto-Baltic was recently discontinued as an accepted language in Wiktionary. I was against it, because it doesn't seem to me that the discussion is over (and because there is no real authoritative source for PBS etyma yet), so it seemed premature, but OK, I can live with that. The problem, it seems to me, is that this forces changing quotes from sources in ways that don't seem legitimate. If a source reconstructs a form as Proto-Baltic, renaming it as Proto-Balto-Slavic without any further changes (e.g., replacing it with a different source) seems to me illegitimate. So: how about having a different status for Proto-Baltic? Say, "older/deprecated/obsolete Proto-language" or something like that? In this manner, we could list deprecated protoforms here (with templates duly identifying them as such) in the same way we list "misspellings of" or "alternative forms of" or "obsolete forms of" words in the main namespace. Here are a couple of reasons:
# People will still come upon older reconstructions -- they are, after all, attested in papers, etymological dictionaries, and other similar sourcces --, and may want to know what they were and why they were abandoned; it would thus be useful to have pages with these forms (clearly tagged as "deprecated" or something like that, and linked to the most recent and most widely accepted form), just as in biological taxonomy it is useful to have lists of old, deprecated scientific names so that older articles can still be read and understood correctly
# To follow the history of a proposed protoform, knowing its predecessors is important -- often, a new protoform is proposed in explicit opposition to, or as an explicit correction of, an earlier proposal. Being able to track these would be useful in understanding the state-of-the-art.
What do y'all think?

: You can still reference a source that reconstructs a Proto-Baltic term in a Proto-Balto-Slavic entry. Think of it this way: ''we'' are reconstructing a Proto-Balto-Slavic term based on someone else's reconstruction of a Proto-Baltic term. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:01, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Sure, but the Proto-Balto-Slavic reconstruction will ultimately look different, at least in that it refers to a different level. (Most PBS entries here look very much different from the PB forms on which they are based). Someone who sees a PB form somewhere and wants to know what it is won't find a page about it here. Shouldn't there be one -- in the same way that there are "alternative spelling of" and "obsolete form of" pages? In this way we don't misrepresent sources, and we allow users to find exactly the form they saw in some source and track its status (deprecated) and understand why it was replaced by the PBS form. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 15:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: Let me give an example. A proto-Baltic form, like e.g. [[Appendix:Proto-Baltic/*akemns]], would have an initial template saying something like: "This protoform is '''deprecated'''. The current consensus form is [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic/akmo]]. Reasons for this change are indicated below. See also [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] for the current view on this branch of Indo-European." In the page itself, the sources for that form (say, Karulis' LEV) would be cited. In this way, the reader would know what this form is, where it came from, and what it was abandoned for. The end result would seem to me to be at least as useful as "alternative spelling of" or "obsolete form of" pages. (I imagine there would also be a heading in the current reconstruction -- something like <nowiki>==Deprecated forms==</nowiki> or <nowiki>==Older proposed forms==</nowiki> -- to link the currently accepted protoform to its previous incarnations.)--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 15:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::: You may be right about including them in some way, shape, or form, but this has nothing to do with misrepresenting sources. We do not misrepresent PB sources by altering the form of the reconstruction to make it PBS-like. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:33, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Thanks. But as for sources, if a source clearly reconstructs a form as X, and we list it here under page Y, then it seems to me we are misrepresenting it, aren't we? (But one possible solution would be to mention this on the page; i.e., have something akin to a <nowiki>===Usage notes===</nowiki>, or a footnote, where we explain that what the source said isn't exactly what is on the page. Would that be OK with you?) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 17:47, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: If you quote the Pythagorean theorem as {{code|lisp|2=(= (+ (* x x) (* y y)) (* z z))}} rather than as <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>, are you misrepresenting the Pythagorean theorem? --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:21, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: If you cite someone who quoted it as <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>, then yes, you are. If you have some standard way of referring to the theorem that supersedes whatever the author you're quoting saying, then you should say so somewhere and link to it. It would be like, you know, changing US spelling to British spelling in a quote written by an American author -- not the right way to quote. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:39, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::: But that's the thing, we're not quoting, we're paraphrasing. And when you paraphrase, it is totally OK to change British spelling to American. I can talk about the "color" of Winston Churchill's eyes and cite a British source that spells it as "colour", and I would not be misrepresenting the source. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:44, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: But that most clearly should ''not'' be the case for reconstructions -- they are ideas and hypotheses, not paraphrases. Their spelling is often exactly what is being claimed -- a *X instead of a *X'. In other words, the sounds that compose the protoform are exactly the theoretical point that is being made; and, in this case, of course the spelling matters, in fact it is what matters most. There can of course be general problems that can be solved in a general way -- researcher 1 uses X for a certain sound (say little glottal stops), while researcher 2 uses Y (say accent amrks) -- and you can adapt the spellings to reflect that (as long as you are consistent, and you write up somewhere why you chose to regularize this difference in the way you did -- and link it to the pages where it is relevant). But in most cases this is not so, and differences in spelling mean something much more serious -- and they should be better documented. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:11, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: The difference is between equality (faithfully representing a source in its original form), and equivalence (understanding its meaning and/or intention). Some sources for PIE write h₂ while others write H₂. These are different things in writing, but we know and understand that they mean the same thing; they are equivalent even if they are not equal. So we can exchange one for the other without problems. Likewise, in Wikitiki's example, "colour" and "color" are unequal representations of equivalent meanings (I might call them "equivalent words", but this hinges on the question of whether different spellings make different words). —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:57, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::And the solution for this is easy: you make a principled choice (I hope, after a discussion with others) for, say, h₂; and then you write somewhere (say, [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European]]) that you did that, and why, and you link this page to those in which h₂ occurs -- so the reader, who may have seen a source that had H₂, doesn't think that you made a mistake. And since you do know why you preferred h₂ to H₂, explaining it in writing shouldn't be a problem. You would only need to do it once, in one page (where you could explain all the other similar choices you made), and then link it to new PIE entries. And again I ask: what is it about this suggestion that is so unreasonable or difficult to do? You spend more time writing comments here than it would take you to do this.--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:11, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::: There's nothing against this in principle, and it's even preferred I would imagine. But at the same time, a lot of Wiktionary's practices and conventions are unwritten; we follow them because we learn from existing examples that are already on Wiktionary. In the case of the choice to use lowercase h₂, the earliest that I can find is [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:About_Proto-Indo-European&oldid=1866229 this]. And there, too, it was simply set as a rule without discussion or motivation. To discuss and motivate it now would be a bit pointless, as there's already a consensus for it. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:19, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::: Good, let's do it like that in the future then. Write up your favorite spelling choices for PIE (h₂ instead of H₂), their reasons (in this case, I suppose because h₂ is more recent?), and voilà: no more for reasons for complains, and people can go back to arguing the merits. The point is not justifying it to other Wiktionarians (though that in itself is not bad: there are always new people coming who don't know where this decision came from, and I'm sure they'd appreciate the information), but to users. If someone checks an etymology here and sees something s/he finds strange, and there is no justification anywhere for it, then this doesn't make Wiktionary look more trustworthy. Again: I'm not suggesting a discussion (unless people think there should be one), I'm suggesting documenting choices, to show, at first sight, that they are choices, not mistakes. Besides, there are things that are much more important than h₂, like your current diatribe about how to spell proto-BS intonations. After this is over, don't you think it would be a service to others to write down somewhere why one variant was preferred? Again, so that it doesn't look like a mistake, but like a true principled choice? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:53, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::::: I'm not going to start documenting everything for PIE all over again. Not unless enough people feel there is a pressing need for it. So far, nobody has complained about our current standards. If you want motivations for PIE notation, you'll have to write them on your own. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:05, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::I hope they do, because this would indeed lead you towards actually improving your PIE forms. Of course, nobody can force you to do the right thing; you're a free individual. I'll simply keep adding {{temp|needsources}} and {{temp|needref}} to your unjustified decisions (unless you'll help me by doing it yourself, of course), hoping that someone other than you will have the knowledge to do the right thing. As for complaints, I did complain against your standards, and I've seen several peole (Štambuk, -sche) disagreeeing with your standards in specific cases, so I think you're assuming a non-existing consensus here. You're more counting on people's intertia than consensus actually. But hey, it is a strong feature of humans too. For all I know, you may well get away with it. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:37, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:::::: There's also the case where different sources disagree on certain sound laws. For example there's a subset of linguists that thinks the change o > a happened independently in all the Balto-Slavic branches rather than in Balto-Slavic itself. In this case, too, we have to pick one particular set of sound laws as the "main" one. Our existing pages treat the o > a change as Balto-Slavic. Likewise, some sources may neglect to indicate accent or acutes even when all descendants are in agreement. You can compare this to Pokorny's reconstructions for PIE: they don't reflect modern understandings so they have all kinds of weird schwas and long vowels while lacking laryngeals. So imagine that the only source we have on a particular form is Pokorny; should we allow ourselves to bring the form up to par? These are all questions that arise when we start giving too much weight to sourcing. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:33, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: Disagreement between sources is ''exactly'' the reason why you need to argue for the forms you create pages for her1e -- I'm so glad you brought this up! Look: if different sources give different opinions and explanations, then you discuss them and explain why you favor one over the other. Things like "different sound laws" can be part of the discussion. All the problems you mention above can be summarized and written up in a page (e.g., [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European sources]]) to which you can refer as part of your explanations for preferring one form over another. I've seen this done in etymological dictionaries, and I see no reason why you couldn't do this here. Sources are good -- even when they disagree... --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:39, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: We don't have to motivate and discuss every single choice we make. For Dutch entries, we choose the spelling as prescribed by the Dutch language union as the norm for lemmas, even though not everyone uses it and some people advocate alternatives. This choice is not motivated or discussed; it's simply set as a rule and accepted by our Dutch editors. In the same way, it's not necessary to discuss why we picked one particular set of sound laws to base our reconstructions on. In many cases, the choice is arbitrary and we simply picked one because we had to make a choice. I think it's more important for us all to agree on a set representation and sound laws for Balto-Slavic reconstructions, than it is for us to discuss and motivate it all. Not that it's not welcome and valuable to give reasons for choosing one particular thing, but that's secondary to making the choice in the first place. ''What'' we choose is more important than ''why''. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:52, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Things are different with reconstructions, especially when there are competing hypotheses. See, a reconstruction is not a ''word'', but an ''idea''; and, as for every idea, justifying it is important. The spelling of a Dutch word is not an idea that is being discussed by several people right now and with different, equally authorative variants (for a still different, but more comparable case, see Nynorsk vs. Bokmål). That's what historical linguists do -- they justify their reconstructions -- and that's what you should do, too, if you care about reconstructions. When you say "we don't have to justify it", you're making a "petitio principii" without there actually being policy on this. Why don't you start a policy page on why we don't have to justify choosing one etymology over another, one set of sound laws over another (thus disputing [[Wiktionary:Etymology]] and let people vote on it? You keep talking as if everybody agreed with you, when this is clearly not the case, much the opposite. I'd like to see you try to defend and get this "policy" of yours approved. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:08, 24 August 2015 (UTC) 
::::::::::::: Well of course, there must be a consensus. I'm aware that the current representation of Balto-Slavic doesn't have consensus, as both you and Ivan seem to disagree on it. But Ivan's solution was to simply create alternative (duplicate) entries or move mine, which of course is no way to come to an agreement. So the question becomes how do we come to an agreement on things, and if we don't, what should be done with existing and future Balto-Slavic pages? Right now, the majority of them has been created by me, so they mostly reflect the (unwritten) standards I follow. But if we insist that there must be consensus first, what do we do with them? Should they be deleted until there is an agreement on them? What about Balto-Slavic forms in etymologies? —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::It's not simply that there should be a consensus -- the consensus shouldn't be hidden, buried in some page that was archived three years ago. The reason for the consensus should be right there, on the page, or at least in [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European]], so that the reader knows what consensus decisions you made, and why. Since you're talking about theories, not words that exist in real languages, then your sources and/or arguments are the basic reason why the protoword is here -- i.e., they are precisely the most important piece of information. (I don't disagree with anyone's spelling of proto-BS, by the way, simply because I'm not sufficiently familiar with it to have a principled opinion. But I see you disagree -- and given this fact, why create pages with one spelling when you can't even agree this is the right thing to do? Why not create a paragraph in, say, [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]], that summarizes this discussion -- after you're done with --, lists your conclusion and the reasons for it? Then you can follow it consistently, and nobody -- or at least not I -- will complain. What I keep not understanding is this need to hide your reasons: that makes no sense to me at all; and it's something that no etymological dictionary I know of has ever done. Why this innovation? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::: Consensus doesn't necessarily have to be formed through discussion. Sometimes all that's needed is for one person to do something and for others to then follow that example. Consensus is often silent, and therefore undocumented, reflected only in practice. There's no documented consensus for most of the edits people make to Wiktionary entries; it's simply the fact that they're left unreverted that creates a sense of agreement for the new status quo. It's only when someone disputes something that a lack of consensus becomes obvious. In the case of Balto-Slavic, you two have voiced your opinions, so that's how I know. I continued creating entries because I figured, the source of the dispute is the naming, but we can still have good content and when we solve the dispute we can rename the entries. I haven't made further attempts to come to a consensus because the attempts I ''did'' make didn't work; Ivan's opinions were fundamentally different from mine on this matter, and nobody else seemed to care enough to provide a third voice, so the matter remained unresolved and both of us just kept doing our own thing. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:28, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::True. And sometimes what is necessary to challenge it is for someone to come here and say "but this is not right, and here's why". And that's what I'm doing, quite legitimately so, since what I am asking for is no more, no less than what every good etymological dictionary known to man already does -- sources + justifications. So: me being here, and the reactions of several others, show that there is no consensus here. If I were you, I would stop adding any new words, and concentrate on justifying the ones you've added already. You know the reasons you had for creating them, so this shouldn't be a problem. What to do with the proto-BS (or IE, or FU...) words? Justify them. If in the future a given justification is abandoned, because a new one came up... then all those pages will need to be moved, and a new justification added. That's how things go with ideas that aren't attested words (and add the reasons why). --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:44, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::: Oh of course, challenge and counter-challenge. And then eventually there's either an agreement, or we all give up until the next time. I actually find it much easier to discuss things with many participants though, that way things are more nuanced and it's not just two opposites clashing and getting nowhere. Much less chance of a stalemate. I will see if I can write up a proposal for PBS reconstructions with those motivations you're after so much. No promises though. I will refrain from creating any more until I do this, but I ask you not to add your templates to the pages. You should also remove them from Germanic pages because the norms are already explained at [[WT:AGEM]], have consensus, and therefore don't need further justification. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:05, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::::::: Yes, the Wiktionarian way, isn't it? So conducive to the right result!... I also like it when there are more participants. Please! And I will indeed be glad to see you write up your proposals, so that others can see what exactly are the tacit rules you're tacitly following with the tacit (dis)agreement of your peers. [[WT:AGEM]] is actually quite good -- proficiat! But it doesn't say why sources or justifications should not be added. (I keep saying: you're following a policy that is not used in any goood etymological dictionary anywhere. "Consensus" indeed!...) I will refrain from adding the template to them for now, but unless someone explains why there shouldn't be sources/justifications in Proto-Germanic words I will eventually return to adding them. Why should it be less good to source/justify Proto-Germanic reconstructions than those of any other protolanguage? As in the other cases, they aren't words, their justification is a crucial element to their eligibility for having a page that states they are the "right" protoform, etc.- --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:49, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

::: Of course, the names of Balto-Slavic pages should agree in notation with what is already the current practice for BS entries. Acutes and accent should be indicated when known, and the distinction between ś/ź (former palatovelars) and š (from RUKI) should be maintained, while the letter ž is not used for Balto-Slavic. This means that such things should be corrected for in the redirect as well. If certain features are reconstructible but not indicated in the page name, this should be explained in the entry. For example, if Slavic and Latvian have s while Lithuanian has š, then the expected reconstruction is ś and any difference should be accounted for by the entry. Likewise, if the descendants all indicate an acute but the page name has none, this too needs explaining. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:05, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Hi CodeCat! Glad you're not whimsically blocking people today.<!-- change of someone else's comment deleted by Pereru --> Now, to keep a form that was reconstructed as PB under a PBS heading would be as wrong as keeping a Latvian word under a Lithuanian heading -- it simply disagrees with the source, i.e. it is factually wrong information. The various letters are just notational conventions, differing from author to author, and could probably be resolved with redirect pages. (You could of course also include this information about Proto-Baltic in the Proto-Balto-Slavic page itself, but I don't see how this would be any better -- care to elaborate?
:::: Let me give an example. I'm going to recreate the [[Appendix:Proto-Baltic/akmens]] page -- CodeCat, please refrain from deleting it until the discussion here is complete -- and make it look like what I'm thinking. Then you guys can give your opinions. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 18:34, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Latvian vs Lithuanian is irrelevant here, that's a completely different case. They are real attested languages, and to label a Latvian word as Lithuanian would be a misrepresentation of the attested facts (not the sources; sources are irrelevant for attestation as we are a secondary source). But for etymologies, sources aren't facts, they're proposals. And as an independent etymological source, we're allowed to make different proposals. So if we think that no, your Baltic reconstruction doesn't make much sense, here's a Balto-Slavic one we agree with more, then we are allowed to do that. Being a secondary source means that we do our own interpretation of the facts. We can of course ''use'' the proposals of others as part of ours, which we do. And we should definitely source that. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:44, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: And reconstructed protoforms are attested as claims at certain levels; and to misrepresent the claims as different from what they were is wrong. If you prefer, compare it to adding a quote to a certain word, but (a) misspelling words in it, or (b) attributing it to the wrong source. Not the right move, ahn?
:::::: Thank you so much for saying the sources are ''proposals'' -- I had said that to you so many times, I thought you never would agree with me. That's exactly why it's so important to ground them. See, when you create a protofrom page here, you're not creating a word: you're creating a ''proposal''. And what makes proposals good or bad are the arguments that support them -- as you yourself said, they are not attested facts. ''That is exactly why sourcing and arguing them is so important: proposals without the accompanying argumentation are not compelling.''
::::::: Finally, I have no Baltic reconstructions -- Karulis does. Take it up with ''him'' if you want, not me. Just like you haven't invented any of the Dutch words you contributed to Wiktionary (right? you haven't, have you? I mean, maybe you think Dutch is like Proto-BS and you should be allowed to add even the ones you invented yourself without further justification...). I have absolutely no problem with you changing any Proto-Baltic etymologies ''as long as you document you reason for doing so, or your source, etc.'' -- so that the reader can see ''why this is supposed to be better''. I repeat: it's not much work, it takes a couple of minutes, and you must have the information already since you're making judgments on the basis of it. There is absolutely no valid reason for you not to do that. Period. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 19:08, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: Adding a source to our proposals just says "we agree with this idea". But that doesn't make sourcing important necessarily. Maybe there aren't any proposals that we agree with, and in that case we have nothing to source. So what Karulis says may be nice, but they are your reconstructions as soon as you put them in etymologies. Again, the source simply says that Karulis agrees with you, but ''you'' put it in the etymology, so ''you'' are proposing it in the name of Wiktionary. And I'm not required to give motivation for changing the etymology if there isn't one to begin with. Take your favourite edit warring target {{m|lv|suns}} for example; the form is not motivated at all, but simply stated as fact, with reference to Karulis. This seems like exactly the kind of thing you're advocating against. A proper etymology, as I understand your view to be, would provide a motivation for the reconstruction. This motivation may itself come from Karulis's work, or it may be your own supplement. Or, it could be documented centrally in an appendix so that we don't have to write it down everywhere. But would have to exist, even for proposals that are sourced. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: Also an added note: Karulis's reconstruction for {{m|lv|suns}} is demonstrably wrong, because it shows the ō > uo diphthongisation for both East and West Baltic. This change only occurred in East Baltic, and is not found in West Baltic<sup>{{temp|R:Fortson 2004}}</sup> so the form Karulis gives is Proto-''East''-Baltic. This is one of the reasons I am against over-reliance on sources; sometimes they are quite obviously wrong. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:34, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:{{outdent}} If we change ''[[suns]]'' from saying "From ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Karulis, ''Book''&lt;/ref&gt;" to saying "According to Karulis, from ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;''Book by Karulis''&lt;/ref&gt;", does that solve at least some of this dispute? That's what was done once before when there was dispute over the etymology of ''[[bensin]]'' — the entry was rephrased to attribute the etymological theory explicitly, rather than giving it in "Wiktionary's voice". [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:45, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:: I think it would help, because, to me, the main problem is making sure that everybody's opinion is clearly marked -- Karulis', CC's (or Wiktionary's), etc. It's all a question of knowing we are reporting the right thing.
:: {{ping|CodeCat}}, look: the point is not whether Karulis is right or wrong -- I have no beef with that. The point is ''making sure your reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with him are documented somewhere, so the reader can see them and decide if s/he agrees with you or not.'' So: if you want to copy the paragraph you wrote above and place it, say, somewhere (in {{l|lv|suns}}, or in [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and then link it to {{l|lv|suns}}, adding a few words to the etymology discussion) -- I have no problem with that. My only problem is with you erasing or changing Karulis' opinion, and then contributing something that cannot be checked. Let me see if I put in bold you will finally react to this: '''I am not saying you have to believe your sources unconditionally; I am saying that you have to explain the choices you make.''' You're not explaining your choices; and it would be easy to do so: just create [[Appendix:Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and do it there, and link it to other pages. (After discussing the 'best solution' with your colleagues, i.e. after you and Štambuk and whoever else is intersted finally agree on how to spell proto-BS words.) But if you simply take down Karulis' opinion without justifying it -- and obviously you can try to justify doing it, since you just did it in the preceding paragraph -- you are NOT improving Wiktionary; you're just making it look more whimsical. My entire point in a nutshell: why hide the reasons for making a choice, especially when this choice is the crucial thing -- the very name of the page you create depends on it? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 20:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Are you saying I need an Appendix page in order to remove an etymology I judge to be bad? Lots of other editors before me have simply edited out bad content, nothing to it. I'm just doing what others have also been doing already. It's you that's now trying to change all this and making it much more complicated, and then complaining when someone doesn't simply do it your new way and they start to butt heads with you. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:32, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Yes, but it's actually very simple. The Appendix page you need is a general guide to why certain things are 'bad content' -- they don't follow accepted correspondences, or they misapply sound laws, or are based on some idea (say, Glottalic Theory) that has been disproved, etc. Only one such page would probably solve all your problems. Then, when you remove an etymology that you think is bad and replace it with one you think is good, you mention in a footnote that so-and-so prosed the bad etymology, but then there's reason 1 and 2 (say, correspondence nr. 35, and sound law nomber 4) why this was bad -- see [[Appendix:Proto-Indo-European reconstructions]] -- which is why it was removed here. For deeper differences you might have specific pages, but I don't think there would be many of those, no. And it would also be possible to link Wikipedia pages, in case you see one that you agree with and you think actually explains the issue. The actual argumentation for removing an etymology would probably be one sentence long, and be added as a footnote. You could also mark it as a "Wiktionary editorial decision" if you don't want your name there. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:01, 24 August 2015 (UTC) NOTE: but note also that you'd have to deal with those that disagree with your reason. I suggest that anyone who disagrees with an etymology should first mention it somewhere -- the talk page of the protoform in question, or maybe [[WT:ES]] -- before making the change. If you do make the change, then also be ready to discuss with whoever disagrees with it, and if his/her arguments are good, then incorporate them in your rationale for accepting and/or refusing his/her criticism in the original footnote that explains the change.--[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 21:04, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: Unless we make this a rule for the removal of ''any'' content, etymological or not, then I'm not on board with this proposal. It would have to be justified why the rules for removing bad etymologies are different from those for removing bad anything else. Wiktionarians have ''always'' had the prerogative to delete content they think is bad, and they've never had to refer to some kind of standards document to justify their removal. An edit summary has generally been enough, and often even that is not done. This has worked well enough so far that you're the first to propose a change. So I will be expecting a more general support for this idea as it seems like a solution without an obvious problem. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:10, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: You might do this if you want, though you yourself have pointed out repeatedly that etymologies are not words, so it's up to you to argue why they should follow the same rules. Feel free to present your arguments. As for me, obviously, protoforms (to quote your post) are proposals, not words; and, in science, proposals exist only because of their arguments. Unless you've changed your mind and no longer think protoforms are proposals rather than words, you should agree, for the sake of consistency with your own stated opinion.
::::::: I dispute the idea that Wiktionarians have always been free to delete whatever they thought was bad content; if they don't justify their deletions, they are stopped and blocked after a while -- i.e., others have to agree with them, tacitly or not, or else they are not allowed to continue. Adding justifications to protoforms, especially when you're making choices, falls within this general area. I maintain that for protoforms (= proposals), justifications are more important, let's say as important as sources are for quotes. You don't seem to want to address that, so I'll assume you tacitly agree (as you assume those Wiktionarians who don't revert your edits tacitly agree with you -- "tacit consensus", right? :-) --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

I kind of like this idea – ''referenced'' Proto-Baltic pages with a clear disclaimer that it's a defunct grouping in its classical sense according to the most recent sources. (Disclaimer: I have yet to see serious challenging of Slavic being a daughter of W-Balt, thus I do not believe that there can be W-Balt + E-Balt grouping excluding Slav).

''We do not misrepresent PB sources by altering the form of the reconstruction to make it PBS-like. --WikiTiki89'' I agree with this, "sadly" that is not exactly the case ("correcting" referenced (even if deprecated by mod. stand.) PB forms to Orig. Res. PBS forms is what lead to edit-warring a while ago, in my reading of things.)

My (personal/pseudoscientific) reading between the lines of Pereru's proposal is that it would serve as another "safety valve" and, baby, we couldn't have enough of those, lol. [[User:Neitrāls vārds|Neitrāls vārds]] ([[User talk:Neitrāls vārds|talk]]) 22:00, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

: From where I stand, PBS does look like a better grouping that PB (the evidence seems to be accumulating). But in the absence of a general work on the topic (say, a PBS etymological dictionary), I don't think it can be regarded as settled -- I'm just conservative on this point. But I have nothing against it as a theory, and as long as things are clearly marked and sources are not misrepresented, I have no problem with it. --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
: Also, I'm not in principle against altering the forms of reconstructions -- I just think this should be done ''in the open'', with the rules clearly laid out and placed in some page where others can see them. What is the point of "adjusting" a form to a spelling that was not in the original source, and then doing nothing, not even adding a footnote, thus misrepresenting the original content? And it's so easy to do it right -- just add the footnote, or change the source to the one whose spelling you think is better. This implies adding only a few words, keeps things clean and organized, and doesn't prevent anyone from expressing his/her agreement or disagreement with this or that protoform. Why not do it? Or, worse yet in CodeCat's case, why ''fight'' against it? --[[User:Pereru|Pereru]] ([[User talk:Pereru|talk]]) 22:26, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

::: Indeed! You have much more experience than I do with being in this position, so I'm hoping you'll share your wisdom in this respect?

:The discussion here (including other headers above) seems to have some of the problems arising from overdoing lexicography:
:# from trying to use sources to "attest" reconstructions,
:# and from treating reconstructions as "headwords" — instead of kind of index words for etymologically connected word groups.
:Creating redirects for alternate reconstructions, and discussion of competing (though not necessarily depreciated) approaches both sound like good ideas, but I do not see the benefit in creating separate pages altogether for reconstructions based on more or less the same data as another one.
:If (and it appears to me that this '''is''' an if) the point of protolang pages is to illustrate the connections between attested languages, then cutting down on repetition is necessary. We do not create separate appendices for things like West Germanic or Anglo-Frisian, even though they are ''known'' to have existed; since this stuff can be adequately discussed already in the "Proto-Germanic" appendices.
:I would hold that, strictly speaking, we have ''no such thing'' as an "accepted reconstructed language" on Wiktionary — that's why they go in the Appendix namespace to begin with. Which is not a namespace that means "just like mainspace, but for second-tier languages". As I see it, an appendix-only status means not only that protolanguages can be subject to new limitations like possibly requiring sources, but also that they don't need, and in some respects probably shouldn't, be treated as lexicographic subjects.
:I also welcome explaining systematic details on how and why to present reconstructions on pages like [[Wiktionary:About Proto-Balto-Slavic]]. That said, if the dispute is about a current inability to establish a consensus reconstruction of PBS that we could use as the index forms, there are a couple of alternate possibilities that can be considered:
:* Picking an index language and listing forms under its' reflex. In the 'stone' example above, we'd perhaps use Lithuanian ''akmuo''. This seems a bit difficult to fit into the Appendix:Proto-Whatever/word notation, though (it might appear to imply that it is a Proto-Baltic or Proto-Balto-Slavic form rather than Lithuanian).
:* Using rough "non-reconstructions". A convention introduced by I think Roger Blench is the symbol "#" in place of "*" when we have a cognate word-family but no systematic reconstruction scheme has been worked out in detail; and adding this to some kind of a "majority representation" (in principle partly arbitrary) of the word root's shape. In this case this would probably bring us to #akmV (since the ending seems to be the main issue).

::[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] said ''(..) problems arising from overdoing lexicography (..) from trying to use sources to "attest" reconstructions'' – Dan brought up that in their opinion protoforms need (in wiki jargon) tertiary sourcing (as opposed to secondary sources.) I completely agree with this (I also think that the vote that's "in the pipeline" essentially implies this.) A way to paraphrase it would be to say that protoforms need to be sourced as "ideas" or "concepts" (which is exactly what they are, imo) as opposed to sourcing them like "real words." On one hand the sourcing requirements are more stringent, OTOH in that they are not "words," things such as "uniformifying" their spelling would be allowed (and prob. encouraged) unlike "real words" where one would need an "alternative/archaic/blah spelling of". There's a bit of disc. on that [[Wiktionary talk:Votes/2013-10/Reconstructions need references#Rationale|here]].
:::It sounds like there might some kind of inflation of "source grades" going on here. In lexicography, an attestation is a primary source, while a mention in a research paper would be a secondary source. However, in etymology, attested words are merely ''data'', while a publication proposing an etymology or a reconstruction is a ''primary'' source. An etymological dictionary would be a secondary source; it'd take something like an etymology section in a general-purpose dictionary to reach a tertiary source. And as usual, there should be no reason to demand tertiary sources specifically.
:::It also follows that basing a reconstruction on "just look at these words here" is not merely synthesis of existing sources, it's unambiguously original research; and, similarly, demanding etymdict-type sources would be equal to positioning Wiktionary as a Wikipedia-type tertiary source. --[[User:Tropylium|Tropylium]] ([[User talk:Tropylium|talk]]) 20:32, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::::''In lexicography, an attestation is a primary source'' – I think on wikt. this is treated as secondary(?) – their head/brain was the "primary source," then they publish it (which renders it "archived") and then it becomes secondary (in my reading of wiki jargon anyhow.) Perhaps, indeed, there could be a "shift forward" by one "grade," so, if lexicog sourcing is primary in your terms then it would make the proposed protoform sourcing "secondary" (or tertiary if it's "shifted" by one.)

::::: Etymological dictionaries are sources of new information as well, not just research papers. I consider them secondary sources, because the primary source is the attestations themselves, and etymological dictionaries and research papers contain interpretations and conclusions based on these attestations. This is the same as what Wiktionary does: Wiktionary collects attestations in the form of citations from primary sources, and then makes interpretations and conclusions as to the meanings of the words and other aspects. Reconstructions are just another kind of interpretation and conclusion drawn from the data, except they're drawn from attestations of many words collectively. Hence, the question that still remains to be answered is whether Wiktionary is an etymological dictionary (secondary source with its own interpretations) or an encyclopedia/compendium of etymological research (tertiary source). Currently, Wiktionary is an etymological dictionary/secondary source as it contains its own interpretations of the data. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:27, 31 August 2015 (UTC)

Just in case, here's the page I was referring to {{w|WP:TERTIARY}}.

I'm also confusing some things myself, it's not the act of sourcing that is to be any "-ary", it is what the project is supposed to be, e.g., wikip. is supposed to be a tertiary source, wikt. is supposed to be a secondary source (well, kind of... the lexicog part at least?), as opposed to secondarily/tertiraily ''sourced'', this is where the "grade inflation" came from, '''sorry, my bad!'''

Also, I don't think there would necessarily be difference in the "grade" of a res. paper and an etyl dict. as the wikip. page seems to suggest that it's the manner of how it is being discussed that determines the "grade", e.g.,
*John Doe wrote in his book "the water is so clear and splashy..." – someone on wikt. makes the judgement that the term "water" is used to mean H2O, J. Doe then is primary source and by using this citation to assert that "water" does indeed mean H2O wikt. is a secondary source.
*But then Jane Doe mentioning a (hypothetical) protoform *wōdor (or whatever) would have to spell out that "wōdor is H2O in Proto-Whatever, because, I, Jane Doe said so." Then this becomes secondary and by quoting this wikt. is being "tertiary."

:An etymological dictionary ''can'' be a primary source, in case its editorial team advances any analyses or etymologies that are entirely new. Most that I have used mainly compile etymologies established by earlier research, however.
:This might be something dependant on the language family though… families like Indo-European or Uralic have a deep research history and there is quite a bit to be cited; but elsewhere, it might well happen that a wider etymological dictionary will be the first etymological source to treat a given language at all.
:(The arbitraryness of the language/dialect division brings up a couple difficulties here, too; if variety X had earlier been considered merely a dialect of language A, then it'll be debatable if old sources on language A will count as sources on X as well.)
:but back to reconstructions: when we're dealing with unattested protolanguages, the crucial point is the lack of lexicographical primary sources. (I'll skip edge cases like Latin or Sanskrit for now.) This means that something ''else'' has to be the primary source, and this is going to depend on what exactly we are sourcing.
:* If we want to establish a proto-Fooian word for let's say 'macaroni' having existed at all, then already someone pointing out that a set of words in Fooian languages for 'macaroni' are of common inheritance is a primary source (common inheritance necessarily requires that a PFooian word existed). Of course, this also presumes that a Fooian language family is already established. After all we presumably do not want to leave backdoors open for Proto-Worlders, Hungaro-Sumerists, everything-is-Tamil-ists, or even partisans for debated families like Hokan or Nilo-Saharan…
:* If we want to know some details about how the PFooian word should be reconstructed, someone's paper or monograph or course handout or whatever, on Fooian historical phonology or historical morphology or semantic change or whatever will be a primary source; and I suppose this holds even if they don't treat the particular word we're interested in. (After all, you don't need to list every single example out there in order to establish that e.g. French ''m-'' usually corresponds to Spanish ''m-''.)
:* If later on Jane Doe comes along to put the pieces together to state "the Proto-Fooian word for 'macaroni' is *nuduly", this would indeed be a secondary source — provided that she's not proposing new details in the process.

== Adding a collocations tab or section ==

[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2012/April#Collocations_section_in_entries.3F|In the past]], there has been support for listing common collocations somewhere (besides usexes, which only fit a few), such as in ====Collocations==== sections. At [[WT:RFD#sentimental_value]], it was suggested that not only collocations but also translations be provided. IMO, it might consume too much visual and byte space to list translations of collocations within entries, so I propose that we [ask the developers to] create a 'Collocations' namespace with its own tab like 'Citations'. We could also link to it using a {{temp|seeCites}}-type template in entries. In that namespace, we could list common collocations, perhaps as the glosses to translation tables to which translations could be added — I have mocked up an example at [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:goods&oldid=34155370 Talk:goods]; note that SOP translations are linked to their component parts. What do you think; would you like a <samp>Collocations:</samp> tab, a ====Collocations==== section, or neither? Should the tab or section contain translations, like at [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:goods&oldid=34155370 ''goods'']? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 19:44, 25 August 2015 (UTC)
:Seems like a reasonable solution to a perennial problem, at least if the default search includes the Collocations namespace. If it doesn't, we won't have helped users. I suppose I would support it anyway because we might be able to come up with some other way to facilitate user search access to it or technical possibilities and rules may change.

: Adding another namespace is a PITA because there's no enforced correspondence between the entry and the other page (which is why the citations namespace should be deleted).

* I don't know the technicalities of the issue. However, I would strongly support this idea, as it would make a natural repository for SoP expressions which actually have some linguistic value, such as what we often call "set phrases", or what is the usual (unexpected) verb which collocates with this noun?- ("wage war", "run for president", "wax lyrical"),  as well as being a useful tool for Eng L2 students.

:As a follow-up to my proposal re translations tables (see my mock-up of what [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:goods&oldid=34155370 Collocations:goods] might look like): when a collocation has a synonym which has a main-namespace entry, we can of course use {{tl|trans-see}}, [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:accordion&oldid=34297933 like so].

* I support a separate namespace for collocations to such an extent that I strongly oppose an additional Collocations section in principal namespace that took up as much screen space as -sches's example. Imagine what that would look like for words like ''set'', ''take'', ''have'', ''head''. I think users of English Wiktionary who want a usable monolingual English dictionary for definitions and diction guidance already have a lot of drek (from their POV) to contend with: 
*# German or Translingual entries where their WP habits lead them to expect English;  
*# {{temp|also}} that often leads them to FL entries;
*# alternative forms sections that go to form of entries that convey no additional information;
*# lengthy etymologies, with PIE and cognates;
*# pronunciation sections they can't use without IPA;  
*# translation tables; 
*# semantic relations headers using words that don't occur in normal speech [hypernyms, hyponyms, troponyms, meronyms]).

* Re Derived Terms vs Collocations.  A derived term would normally be a blue link term. E.g. [[mineral water]] is a derived term in the entry for [[mineral]]. A collocation is "use of English". Collocations are generally not going to be suitable as main entries, for SoP-iness. It's, for instance, knowing typical useful verb-noun collocations - such as "follow instructions", or "take aim", or "entertain a doubt". It's also about typical adjective-noun or adverb-verb collocations, etc. Words such as "wedge" would be enhanced if you could read that one "drives a wedge between" things, and so on. Word chunks that, if you know them, can make your English sound "good". However, I repeat, these are not derived terms. I am of the opinion that, by the time any Eng L2 learner is wondering about this stuff, they will already be familiar with the term Collocation, and so will be very happy to see the section, or tab, available as a resource. -- [[User: Algrif |<i>A<small>LGRIF</small></i >]][[User talk:Algrif |<span style="color:#FFD700"> talk</span>]] 15:32, 7 September 2015 (UTC)
:: I disagree that an English L2 learner would likely know the meaning of the word "collocation". For instance, my French is at the point at which such a tool on Wiktionnaire would be very useful to me, but if it was labelled "collocation", I would only know what it meant because it's the same word in English. I haven't ever seen the word in French before (the only reason I know it's the same is because I just looked it up), and I imagine it would be the situation for second language speakers of English. Something slightly wordier, but using more familiar English, might be "common phrases with this word" or "derived phrases" (as distinct from "derived terms"...which could be confusing, especially for new editors).

== Gender markers in Polish adjective entries ==

{{temp|pl-adj}} currently requires a gender parameter. However, gender in Polish adjectives is inflectional, not lexical, and the lemma form is almost always masculine nominative singular (with rare exceptions for "female-only" adjectives like {{m|pl|ciężarna||pregnant}} or {{m|pl|szczenna||pregnant with puppies}}). I think these markers should be removed and the gender parameter ignored and eventually removed through a bot, as the exceptional cases can be easily identified by looking at the adjective ending. Are there any objections? --[[User:Tweenk|Tweenk]] ([[User talk:Tweenk|talk]]) 22:30, 26 August 2015 (UTC)

== Scientific symbols? ==

At present, there's no good place to put scientific symbols in entries (eg ''E'' for [[energy]] or [[electric field]], ''t<sub>1/2</sub>'' for [[half-life]] etc.) What would people say to modifying {{temp|en-noun}} or creating a new inflection line template to show these symbols (similar to what's currently done at [[speed of light]], but neater). So for instance:

:'''speed of light''' (''uncountable'', ''symbol'' ''[[c]]'')

:'''velocity''' (''countable and uncountable'', ''plural'' '''[[velocities]]''', ''symbol'' ''[[v]]'' or '''[[v]]''')

:'''magnetic flux''' (''uncountable'', ''symbol'' '''[[Φ]]''' ''or'' '''Φ<sub>B</sub>''')

== Attributive use of nouns ==

How to we tell for certain that a noun that modifies another noun is or isn't an adjective?

: [[Wiktionary:English adjectives]] which is of course, not policy. [[Wiktionary:About English]] contains no policy that I can see on what separates an adjective from a noun used attributively. I actually don't think it's that hard and in ambiguous cases, there should be three citations which are clearly adjectival not either nominal or adjectival. For example "this desk is wood" would not count as a clear adjectival cite as it's just as easily (or more easily) identifiable as a noun than an adjective.

:Apply [[Wiktionary:English adjectives#Tests_of_whether_an_English_word_is_an_adjective|tests of adjectivity]], and Occam's razor. ''Donkey'' has not (yet) been shown to be used in contexts that are clearly adjectival, like ''this sanctuary is donkeyer than that one''; ''it was very red and very donkey''. In contexts where either a noun or an adjective could work (''donkey sanctuary'' could be compared to ''noun sanctuary'' or ''improbable sanctuary''), Occam's razor suggests it's more likely to still be a noun than to have acquired a second part of speech which is peculiarly limited to only those varied contexts where the first part of speech could also be used. On the other hand, ''epidemic'' [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=epidemic&type=revision&diff=34278713&oldid=33651599 is used] in contexts where only an adjective could work, so it must be an adjective (some of the time). It's also used in contexts where only a noun could work, e.g. in the plural, hence it is also a noun. When a word that has been shown to be both an adjective and a noun is used in contexts where it could be either (like ''epidemic disease''), I think we've tended to default to the interpretation that it's an adjective unless semantics make the other interpretation more likely: e.g. the adjective is the best semantic fit in ''epidemic fraud'' (widespread fraud), while the noun would be the best fit in *''epidemic storage'' (section of a lab which stores samples of viruses that cause epidemics). But if a prime minister fakes an outbreak of disease in order to push through security measures, you could speak of "his epidemic fraud" with ''epidemic'' as a noun, just like you could mock postmodernism as "that postmodernism nonsense".

For example, Century 1911 has ''solitary wasp'' as a run-in at the entry for solitary. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  21:33, 29 August 2015 (UTC)

:This has been recreated, and I have rewritten it in English. However, I can't find it in any other dictionary and feel it is sum-of-parts. There are plenty of hits for the two words used together so I'm not sure that RfV would be useful. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 20:33, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::Take a look at the bottom of the entry for {{R:Century 1911|solitary}} where it is a run-in entry. I take this to mean that "the solitary wasps" was considered at least an informal grouping at that time and that the most promising source of citations would be before 1910, though the term may have continued in use past that time. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  22:23, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
::I have edited the entry in line with the thoughts above, adding a dated definition with cites from the 19th century and adding {{temp|&lit|social|wasp}} to replace the previous SoP definition. Note that two of the citations are of ''Social Wasps'', the capitalization being suggestive of something other than SoPitude. The entry could be further improved or challenged, of course.

== Which English entries need pronunciation? ==

Can someone generate a list of English entries that don't have {{temp|IPA}}? But somehow sort them in order of importance? I'm not sure how we would go about that, but there are basic entries out there, like [[garbage]], which really should have the IPA pronunciation. [[User:Ultimateria|Ultimateria]] ([[User talk:Ultimateria|talk]]) 04:41, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
:I'd like this too, though "in order of importance" is probably an unattainable goal. I've added pronunciation info at {{m|en|garbage}} now. —[[User:Angr|Aɴɢʀ]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 06:52, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Here's a list of top 100 English entries whose English section did not contain "<nowiki>{{IPA</nowiki>" on 28 July 2014, ordered by [[Wiktionary:Frequency lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000]], not constrained to lemmas, based on 20140728 dump: <small>said, no, de, hands, Gutenberg, english, 2, replied, united, john, looking, coming, making, sn, arms, followed, appeared, continued, ety, reached, suddenly, miles, taking, beyond, nearly, laws, comes, natural, laid, copyright, opened, an', 4, makes, tried, Dr, lived, certainly, unto, placed, letters, remained, blockquote, happened, minutes, loved, knows, donations, thoughts, including, filled, seeing, tears, places, raised, moved, giving, laughed, leaving, started, circumstances, c., lines, considered, observed, wished, Charles, formed, trying, allowed, girls, discovered, sitting, ways, officers, offered, happiness, produced, walls, declared, prepared, takes, soldiers, talking, steps, intended, matters, appears, closed, gives, required, ladies, fixed, troops, camp, copies, v., running, cases, names.</small>

If you want to have the list constrained to lemmas, let me know. Basically, let me know:
* a) How many items you want
* b) Whether you want to constrain to lemmas
* c) To what location do you want the list delivered, like someone's talk page, some subpage, or the like

The process is rather simple, based on a dump. The key part is identifying English sections that do not contain "<nowiki>{{IPA</nowiki>". This is done using the following script find-missing-English-IPA.py:
<syntaxhighlight lang=Python>
import sys, re
entryStartFound = False
IPAFound = False
title = ""
for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
  line = line.rstrip()
  if "<title>" in line: title = re.sub(" *</?title> *", "", line)
  if entryStartFound:
    if "{{IPA" in line or "{{audio-IPA" in line: IPAFound = True
    if "----" in line or "</text>" in line:
      entryStartFound = False      
      if not IPAFound: print title
      IPAFound = False
  if "==English==" in line: entryStartFound = True
</syntaxhighlight>
The rest is intersecting the result with the frequency list in such order that the result is sorted by frequency list. The process was as follows:
* find-missing-English-IPA.py enwiktionary-20140728-pages-articles.xml >English-entries-with-no-IPA.txt
* grep -Fx -f English-entries-with-no-IPA.txt frequency-list-English-PG-10000.txt >t.txt
*: That's a set intersection, but the order of files matter.
* head -100 t.txt
*: Output the first 100 lines
You need Python, grep and head. You probably do not really need head, since you can pick the top 100 in your favorite editor. grep is used to do set intersection; if you have another method, you don't need grep.

== Syllable counting ==

The number of syllables in English is not always reliable based on syllabification. —<span class="Latf" style="font-size: 100%">[[User:JohnC5|John]][[User talk:JohnC5|C5]]</span> 19:36, 25 August 2016 (UTC)

: The number of syllables in any language is always reliable based on syllabification. That is what syllabification is defined to be. I agree it might not be the same as hyphenation. [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]])
:: That is unfortunately not the case for stress-timed languages. See the discussion [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2016/February#Proposal: "Category:English trisyllabic words" and similar categories|here]]. —<span class="Latf" style="font-size: 100%">[[User:JohnC5|John]][[User talk:JohnC5|C5]]</span> 20:08, 25 August 2016 (UTC)

== Request for guidance ==
I simply want to mark English words by the number of syllables so it will be easier to teach friends who are learning English.  Apparently boldly creating the categories is not the way to do it, as they were deleted in less than a day.
(I don't know why there wasn't a Request for Deletion, just a bold deletion.}
How do I accomplish what I want to do ? {{unsigned|Bcent1234}}
:Greetings. See [[:Category:English words by number of syllables]] for multiple syllable categories. I populated them per your request. Unfortunately, the categories for 1 and 2 syllables are poorly populated, because the entries themselves are lacking the correct syllable markers. They may be fixed by adding the dot (.) and stress marker (ˈ) in the {{temp|IPA}} template wherever they are needed.
:The categories for 3 or more syllables seem to be OK. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:52, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

:: Daniel, I note that https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/no doesn't get categorized as 1 syllable. Is that because it uses a complex template instead of just IPA ? [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:30, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::: The entry [[no]] is using a separate template called {{temp|audio-IPA}}. You are correct, that template was not categorizing entries by their syllables, but now it is. The entry [[no]] should be categorized as 1 syllable now. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:17, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::  Also, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acrid#Pronunciation and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/adage#Pronunciation doesn't get categorized as 2 syllables. even though it uses the IPA template. I don't understand [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:39, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

:::I changed the category names for 1 and 2 syllable words in English. See [[:Category:English supposedly 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English supposedly 2-syllable words]].
:::The older categories ([[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]]) are being automatically emptied at the moment; it will take some time before they are completely empty. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:19, 9 September 2016 (UTC)


== Primary stress ==

Re a few of your recent edits: you can't have two primary stress markers (ˈ) in one pronunciation. You can use the secondary stress marker (ˌ) or the syllable marker (.) for the remaining syllables. [[User:Keith the Koala|Keith the Koala]] ([[User talk:Keith the Koala|talk]]) 07:34, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

: You ''can'' have two primary stresses in one pronunciation, although it's very rare in single words. The difference is secondary stress is literally less stressed than the primary stress, while two primary stresses are equally stressed. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 10:19, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

== Secondary stress marks ==

These aren't the same as syllable boundaries. Please stop adding them, because you don't understand what you're doing. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 19:26, 11 September 2016 (UTC)

:: is it possible that you were talking about https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=anthroposphere ? The a in the IPA has been there since the article was created in 2008.

:: I assume the long schwa you referred to on my talk page is where a schwa is followed by the faint colon (I don't know its name). In tracing back, that pronunciation has been on that page since the pronunciation was first added in 2010.

Thanks! – [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 17:23, 28 November 2016 (UTC)
: it's a bit late to tell me your preference. I am sorry, but I will not comply with your request. I have made several thousand by now, and this is the first mention of your preference. I always place the syllable count at the end of the Pronunciation section. That is the easiest way for auditors to see it, and compare the count of syllables with the EnPr or IPA pronunciation. Alternately, I place it after the English tag.  When there is no Pronunciation section, I will comply with your preference and move it to the bottom of the language section, before any tag for the next language, if it exists.

::: I am concerned about the auditability of putting the category for the number of syllables in a place other than the Pronunciation section. Will this make the work of a reviewer too onerous ? [[User:Bcent1234|Bcent1234]] ([[User talk:Bcent1234|talk]]) 20:29, 28 November 2016 (UTC)
:::: I agree that it's easier to handle if related information is bundled together. However it's also important to have consistent formatting across entries.

== Overlinking ==

I have undone [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=tooth&diff=prev&oldid=41861397 this edit] at [[tooth]].  Words in quotations should not be linked per [[WT:EL]].  I also think that is a bad case of overlinking in any case.  You seem to be doing a lot of that, but I'm not sure that it is helpful to link that many words in an entry.  Better to judiciously choose words that may be unfamiliar to the reader, or are being used with an unusual meaning.

== Reordering L3 headers ==

({{ping|-sche}}, as I believe this is of interest to you.) I think that a major long-running criticism of Wiktionary is how difficult it is to find the information one is looking for. A good way to deal with this would be colour-coding, which some other language Wiktionaries use to some degree, but I expect that'd get a poor reception among Wiktionarians here, so a less aggressive approach would be to push Alternative forms (and maybe Pronunciation) after the definitions except when sorted by multiple etymologies where those sections apply to all etymologies, or something along those lines. I'm not tied to any single approach, but I think that we could make great strides in user-friendliness by thinking about how to push the information people want most to the top. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 06:33, 28 January 2016 (UTC)

: Angr (IIRC) has pointed out that one difference between how we present etymologies vs how other dictionaries do is that ours have big headers that take up a lot of space. A reason for putting alternative forms at the top of entries is to confirm to people that they've reached the right word, when e.g. they spell it ''kinnikinnik'' but our main entry is ''kinnikinnick'', or when there are UK vs NZ vs etc differences... but the "Alternative forms" header usually (not at ''kinnikinnick'', but usually) takes up more space than the one or two alt forms themselves. There's wasted space to the right of all the headers. Other online dictionaries tend to fill that space, e.g. putting inflection info that we put on the headword line next to the POS declaration, or putting pronunciation info there. If we could do that, resulting in an appearence like [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Sandbox&oldid=36866793 this], it might be an improvement, separate from any re-arrangement of headers. It would require us to eschew ===This type of header=== for those sections, though. De.Wikt does eschew ===These=== for unimportant headers &mdash; though they leave all the empty whitespace to the right of the pseudo-headers &mdash; so we know it's doable and doesn't make entries too hard to edit.
: We could also streamline pronunciation sections by making the IPA the link to the audio file. One entries that had only a few pronunciations, the pronunciation section could fit on a single line. This is how other online dictionaries do it.
: I don't like the idea of colours, unless you mean only to colour all the POS headers with the same neutral colour like de.Wikt does. Using different colours for different sections would be an accessibility issue (for colourblind people), and colouring the entire section would be visually unpleasant / distracting (garish), in my view.

:::* Comparing between the POS header styles of dewikt and frwikt, I like the latter more. I'd probably support using that format here.
:::* I support placing "Alternative forms" after the definitions. One reason is: "Alternative forms" are very similar to "Synonyms", to the extent that I've seen occasionally the same word linked in both headers in the same entry.

== propose a vote to rename (1) i -> q; (2) italbrac -> qualifier q; (3) qualifier -> q? ==

Hi, since you've been proposing lots of votes lately I wonder if you'd be willing to propose another one along the vein of the {{temp|term}} -> {{temp|m}} and {{temp|cx}} -> {{temp|lb}} change. This was originally suggested by [[User:CodeCat]] but I agree with the gist of it. Basically, {{temp|i}} and the longer-form {{temp|italbrac}} are synonyms for {{temp|q}}/{{temp|qual}}/{{temp|qualifier}}, but have sub-optimal names because the names suggest a specific formatting convention (italics + paren) when they really are intended to have a sort of semantic function. So I'd suggest a 4-part vote:

# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|i}} -> {{temp|q}}
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|italbrac}} -> {{temp|qualifier}} (or to {{temp|q}} if part 3 passes)
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|qualifier}} -> {{temp|q}}
# Vote to bot-substitute {{temp|qual}} -> {{temp|q}}

I imagine (1) and (2) will pass easily; I'm not sure about (3) or (4) since some people have voiced objections to the shorter names and there are already bots that try to rename {{temp|i}} to {{temp|qualifier}}.

:Sure, I don't mind creating the vote page for this. Should we create a BP (or maybe a GP) discussion right now to get feedback from other people? Are there any other discussions about this move? If the answer is yes, then I should link to the discussions from the vote.
:I'd like to get one thing out of the way: I don't know if other people would rather use RFM than a vote.

== Wikisaurus and link parameter ==

Years ago, you wanted {{tl|ws}} and {{tl|ws header}} use link= parameter while I insisted on hyperlink= parameter. Given recent trends in short template names supported by a supermajority in [[Wiktionary:Votes/2015-11/term → m; context → label; usex → ux]], and given how easy to understand link= seems to be:

Switching {{tl|ws}} and {{tl|ws header}} to link= (while keeping hyperlink= for compatibility with old page revisions) seems to be in order.

What do you think? Would you change the templates to support the short link= form? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:49, 21 February 2016 (UTC)

:{{ping|Dan Polansky}}: Sorry, I left your message unaswered for quite a long time.
:Regardless of what my opinions were years ago, what I think now is this:
:Yes, in my opinion "link=" is much better than "hyperlink=". But I'd rather use {{temp|ws|word|link=-}} with an hyphen there, to make it clear that the parameter "link" is doing ''something''. To someone unacquainted with the template, it is not obvious that the "link=" (or "hyperlink=") in {{temp|ws|word|link=}} has any meaning.
:Yes, I would change the templates to support the short link= form and would keep hyperlink= for compatibility with old page revisions.
:What do you think about using "|link=-" with the hyphen?

::* When you saw any category like [[:Category:Finnish redlinks]] with terms appearing or disappearing, it was because I was testing [[Module:redlink category]] and [[Template:redlink category]] to see if it was possible to populate all redlinks categories at once.
::* I checked the code of {{temp|fi-form of}} and I don't think the order of parameters should change whether an entry is categorized in [[:Category:Finnish redlinks]]. That template uses {{temp|m}} to link to your example word "parempi" and that always makes the redlink to be categorized if "parempi" is a redlink. Probably the entries just appeared and disappeared when you checked because I was coincidentally fiddling with the redlink template/module at the time.
::* At some point I made a mistake that caused entries like {{m|en|Abyssinian}}, {{m|en|aardvark}} and {{m|fi|viitisenkymmentä}} to be categorized too, but that was quickly fixed.

"you can repeat a letter to suggest a long, extended vocal pronunciation" rather than creating entries for every possible case. It's a bit like "leet" hackerspeak: you can write d0g, b0g, w0g for [[dog]], [[bog]], [[wog]], but this is done by a rule from the original spelling, and they aren't usefully separate words. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 05:30, 2 May 2016 (UTC)

::For reference, arguments about whether we should have entries like these in the first place are at [[Wiktionary:Votes/2014-01/Treatment of repeating letters and syllables]]. (passed 10-3-1, you supported the vote) Anyway, I'll stop creating these entries for now, but I'll finish moving the existing entries from [[:Category:English elongated terms]] to [[:Category:English elongated forms]]. That vote is evidence that people want entries like these, but if Wiktionarians change their mind and decide they don't want these entries anymore, personally I should be fine with that, too.
::About the problem of a learner thinking "oh, so ''niiice'' is an English word that I can use!": I added a comment "(nonstandard, for emphasis)" in all entries that use {{temp|elongated form of}}, including [[niiice]]. It's just an idea, I can remove that comment if people don't like it, but at least that learner is less likely to commit a mistake based on that entry. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 05:49, 2 May 2016 (UTC)

:::I should add, it feels to me that [[niiice]] has some non-obvious difference in tone or usage from [[nice]] but I wasn't able to put into words in the entry. Certainly [[suuure]] and [[riiight]] are usually sarcastic, and this fact should be mentioned somewhere. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 05:55, 2 May 2016 (UTC)

:::: Hmm, yes. But I think the difference is more in pronunciation than in spelling. I mean, you already know the word ''nice''; you say it in a drawn-out, sarcastic way (step 2); and then someone tries to write down what you said, to capture the sarcasm (step 3). I feel as though some of this stuff is... I wanted to say grammar, but it's not. Let's say "extralexical". The wiki family does have a gap for something that would tell us about grammar rules (French ''ne...pas'', English inversion [''should he wish to do it''], etc.) and stuff like snowclones, but it doesn't seem to fit in mainspace. I suppose appendices are as good a place as any, for now. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 01:53, 5 May 2016 (UTC)

::::: Another thing one could reasonably say is that, when ''any'' word is pronounced in a markedly strange way, that might be a sign of sarcasm (at least in English, or some Western cultures). I think it was the comedy ''The Fast Show'' where a person had a naturally sarcastic voice and his own (foolish) opinions were constantly interpreted as ironic and therefore excellent.

*: My feeling is that sometimes Daniel wants to create entries for things that can't be properly captured that way, like the ''repetition'', or (making up an example here) the fact that ''saying something really loud'' might mean that you are angry. I think [[Appendix:Repetition]] is much better than creating a zillion entries for ''shiiit, maaan, hooouse'', etc. but I also find myself wondering who is going to find and/or use something like [[Appendix:Shouting]].

As far as I'm concerned, I could have used [[WT:REE]], maybe I just got used to [[WT:WE]].

:(e/c) In my opinion, replacing instances of nocap with notext, adding the text manually into the entry where necessary, could work as a step in the direction of removing the "Borrowing from" text altogether from the template. I saw your comment in [[WT:RFM#Template:borrowing]] and I support and agree with it: "We could get rid of the text from the template altogether, and add it manually to the entries instead. Then it would work like {{temp|der}} and {{temp|inh}}, which don't include text either." I consider it an annoying inconsistency that {{temp|bor}} currently returns "borrowing from" while {{temp|inh}} and {{temp|der}} do ''not'' return "inherited from" and "derived from", respectively. In fact, I've seen many entries, with code like "<nowiki>{{bor|it|en}} and {{der|it|fr}}</nowiki>", which apparently means "borrowed from English and French" but the second template was {{temp|der}} (or {{temp|etyl}}), likely to avoid showing up "borrowing from" twice or the need to use "notext=1".
:That said, I believe [[:Category:bor with nocap]] is important, because I'd like to know what are the entries that use "a borrowing from". In most other cases, (that is, when you just use {{temp|bor|xx|yy|word}}, and it is not in the middle of a sentence), I believe "Borrowed from X" is the best option. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 14:56, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

:: There seem to be a fair number of (mostly Latvian?) entries that use <code>nocap=</code> just so that they can say "A borrowing" instead, which is rather silly.

:I'm not finished with the code for letter categories yet. Should I create something like [[Template:letter cat]] (together with [[Module:letter cat]]) and make [[Template:auto cat]] provide the parameters to the letter template? That could be done, but it feels to me like an unnecessary duplication. In the long term, I think it would be nice deleting {{temp|poscatboiler}}, {{temp|charactercat}}, etc. (like {{temp|affixcatboiler}} and a few others were deleted in the past) IMO, we don't need the other templates if just {{temp|auto cat}} is able to do all the work.

== Letter categories ==

The idea as such is pretty good, but are we going to end up for thousands of categories for all of the Chinese characters too? Also, you may want to modify {{temp|charactercat}} to categorise it in there somehow, but again you'll end up with thousands of them. See [[:Category:Japanese terms by their individual characters]]... —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 23:05, 27 July 2016 (UTC)
:Thanks for saying that the idea as such is pretty good. But I feel that what I'm currently doing is different than what {{temp|charactercat}} is doing. We can still use {{temp|charactercat}}, but it would have to be adapted somehow.
:I created {{temp|charactercat}}, [[:CAT:Japanese terms by their individual characters]] and [[:CAT:English terms by their individual characters]] a few years ago. As I know you're aware, they are about categorizing entries that contains certain characters. And the Japanese version already has 4,264 subcategories.
:Today I created these categories: [[:Category:Aa]], [[:Category:Áá]], [[:Category:Bb]], etc. They are about categorizing appendices listing the letters of a certain language, like [[Appendix:Letters/English]], [[Appendix:Letters/Portuguese]]—and possibly [[Appendix:Letters/Dutch]] in the future.
:As it stands, we have:
:* [[:CAT:English terms spelled with É]] => contains entries like [[café]] and [[fiancée]]
:* [[:CAT:Éé]] => contains [[Appendix:Letters/Portuguese]] and [[Appendix:Letters/Spanish]]
:I'm still trying to figure out what would be the best category tree. [[:CAT:English terms spelled with É]] should probably be a member of [[:CAT:Éé]].

:I am especially unsure of the final -s (-s or -ʃ). Thanks. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 06:21, 4 September 2016 (UTC)
::I'm not a native speaker but I'll venture to say that the pronunciation of the final -s will probably depend on where the speaker is from. Rio speakers will say /ʃ/ whereas most others will say /s/ (probably regardless of the fact that the place itself is in Rio). In other words there isn't a single Brazilian Standard Pronunciation. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 16:19, 4 September 2016 (UTC)
:::BTW I hate the use of /ʁ/ for Brazilian Portuguese. I have never ever heard [ʁ] used for this sound, which AFAIK is always pronounced unvoiced (except maybe preceding a voiced obstruent) and should be written /χ/. I know that this is sort-of kind-of supposed to be a compromise between standard [χ]/[h] and the [r] used by some speakers (and the [ɹ] used in syllable codas by some other speakers) but IMO it does a poor job of this. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 16:32, 4 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::I tend to take IPA with a grain of salt. Mainly I use it for letters that can have multiple pronunciations (that I probably already know), and I just need a way to see which pronunciation is needed for a given word. As for Portuguese r, /ʁ/ seems to be the usual choice. See [[w:Portuguese phonology]]. Even though the IPA for r in many words is ʁ, the actual pronunciation varies. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|—Stephen]] <sup>([[User talk:Stephen G. Brown|Talk]])</sup> 20:55, 4 September 2016 (UTC) 
:::::: Well [ʁ] is the most common pronunciation in Portugal (other than in the North), but like Benwing, I rarely hear that from Brazilians (but I wouldn't quite say never); I usually hear [h] from Brazilians. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:09, 4 September 2016 (UTC)

::::I think /ʁo.ˈdɾi.ɡu d͡ʒɪ ˈfɾej.tɐʃ/ is correct Rio accent, but you may want a second opinion. São Paulo speakers (like myself) will say /s/. I believe I would say: /ˈfɾej.tas/ (instead of /ˈfɾej.tɐʃ/). --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 16:39, 4 September 2016 (UTC)

(which is sensible) I even added a conspicuous note in both categories, warning that if people want to see proper categorization, they must fix the entries first by adding proper syllable separators. This is a problem of the thousands of the entries lacking syllable markers, not the module. So I'm suggesting having separate (cleanup) categories for entries that are automatically recognized as having 1 or 2 syllables, because in fact they often have 3 or more syllables. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 19:43, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::: This is a problem with the module having incorrect expectations of the IPA transcriptions.

We could have these ''empty'' categories: [[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]] (and possibly [[:Category:English 3-syllable words]]), and [[Module:IPA]] could populate separate hidden categories with all the obvious mistakes.

:::::::: How would the module know which ones are mistakes and which ones not? I oppose having any of this code in the live module until we know it works. As for syllabification, the least-defined aspect of English syllabification is to which syllable a consonant belongs, which is irrelevant if what you are doing is counting syllables. It is of course possible to try to count the vowels and diphthongs, but it's not something you're going to get right on the first try, which is why I'm urging you to use a test module and create test cases. The other tricky thing, which we've already discussed is ambiguous cases like ''file'' and ''filing'', which you had mentioned you wanted to categorize as both. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:14, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::: If in the future I decide trying to make the module count vowels and digraphs, then yes, I'll use a test module. Making a smarter module was not my idea, though. I was just basically going to count the "." in each entry, which is why I had considered the module finished.
::::::::: Re: "How would the module know which ones are mistakes and which ones not?" -- see my answer from 19:02, 9 September 2016 (UTC). I just said I was going to change the category names, not that the module would be able to recognize right from wrong somehow. I already started to populate the [[:Category:English supposedly 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English supposedly 2-syllable words]]. Feel free to suggest different names for these categories.
::::::::: Even if it's impossible to separate syllables accurately for many English words, there are many ''other'' English words like [[alchemist]] that currently have no syllable markers and would benefit if someone added the markers. That's one reason why having the "supposedly" categories is useful, in my opinion.
::::::::: About [[file]]: my idea was to categorize it in a separate category named [[:Category:English 1- or 2-syllable words]]. I mentioned we could use a separate template for that, like possibly {{temp|syllables|fi?le}} (1 or 2 syllables), as opposed to {{temp|syllables|fi-le}} (2 syllables). Still if we can do that using only {{temp|IPA}}, the separate template would just duplicate content.
::::::::: If all English words had syllable markers, then [[file]] could have {{temp|IPA|/xxyy/|/xx.yy/|lang=en}} to show both separations of syllables. The module would then categorize it into both [[:Category:English 1-syllable words]] and [[:Category:English 2-syllable words]]; but the module could be changed to categorize the entry into [[:Category:English 1- or 2-syllable words]] instead. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:08, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::: I oppose having "supposedly" categories or any other name for these categories. If the content of the categories is not correct, then they are not ready to be live. Why would [[alchemist]] benefit from syllabification? The whole thing I'm trying to say is that syllabification is a mostly meaningless concept in English. {{temp|IPA|/xxyy/|/xx.yy/|lang=en}} is simply wrong, because it's not as though there are two distinct pronunciations of ''file'', but that the same pronunciation of ''file'' can be counted as either having one or two syllables. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:27, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::: "Why would [[alchemist]] benefit from syllabification?" -- {{ping|Bcent1234}} asked for it and is willing to add syllabification in entries. Is that a service we cannot provide? It bothers me that some entries have the separation of syllables and others don't have it.
::::::::::: I wonder if, in English-speaking countries, kids in English class in are taught to separate syllables, and if Wiktionary could help with it. In Brazil, any Portuguese textbook for a given age has exercises to group words into: "proparoxítona", "paroxítona", "oxítona", "monossílaba", "dissílaba", "trissílaba" and "polissílaba" and dictionaries often separate syllables of all words. Visit http://michaelis.uol.com.br and search for an English word; it will show the separation of syllables. (it counts "file" as having only 1 syllable) --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:41, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Who would add this {{temp|syllables}} template and what would it do? If all it does it count syllables, why not just manually add categories? If there is a meaningful syllabification, it can be shown in the IPA transcription, but it is not guaranteed that we can do this for every word. In my school, we were not taught to separate syllables. It is a useless skill when it comes to English (and other West Germanic languages), even though it may be useful in Portuguese and other romance languages (and in Russian and other Slavic languages). I'd imagine that if English schools were to do this, they'd use the orthographic syllables (i.e. hyphenation) and not the actual spoken syllables. The dictionary you link to is also just showing the hyphenation. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 22:08, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

: Please see [[acceptableness]] as an example of an entry with correct syllable separation. The page has a "Pronunciation" section with a template called {{temp|IPA}}, which separates syllables using a dot (.) character between all syllables.
: Please try to fix [[aggregate]]. You can do this by adding a dot (.) between all syllables in the IPA template. When you find either of the two stress markers ( ˈ and ˌ ), please place the dot behind it ( .ˈ and .ˌ ), even though the entries would be categorized the same without the dot behind it.

== Edit Filter ==

I think your edit filter needs more work: the main source of the offending syntax is from substing gone wrong, and since you can't see substed text until you save the edit and then look at the wikitext, a very likely scenario is someone clicking "save changes" and having no clue why the system stops them- even if they preview the edit, they won't be able to see anything out of the ordinary. What's more, there will be no trace in the edit history for anyone who tries to help them- only the abuse log will show what went wrong, and most won't think to look there.

Please try to come up with an abuse-filter message to explain the error. Otherwise, you're going to be punishing good-faith contributors without giving them a chance to learn from their mistakes, and causing frustration at the Grease Pit when people try to troubleshoot an invisible, non-repeatable error. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 03:54, 12 October 2016 (UTC)
:I understand. For the record, we are talking about [[Special:AbuseFilter/56]]. It was my first edit filter. I tweaked it and now it shows the standard warning [[MediaWiki:Abusefilter-warning]] and it does not ''prevent'' the edit to be published, but it tags the offending entry with "triple-braces" tag. Is that not enough? Coming up with a specific abuse filter message would solve this problem? I think I could create a separate template with: "Warning: This entry contains triple braces {{{ }}}, which are usually the result of an error when [[mw:Manual:Substitution|substing]]." --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 04:17, 12 October 2016 (UTC)

:::::: Yes, it is offensive and I won't forgive it, because it does not have a reasonable rationale behind it. I can forgive something based on solid arguments, but this is not.<br />First of all, it would be correct by CodeCat to ping us in the post in Beer parlour, so we would know about that section there and could react. Second: none of the reverters ever mentioned to us the "descriptiveness" you mention now, fortiori pointed us to any relevant page where it is clearly and unambiguously described. Third: describing - at least in Czech - means to show the reality as it is. So the reality is, that the disputed spellings are incorrect and not considered as alternative. Paradoxically those, who use them, consider them rather correct spelling and the real correct spelling as misspelling, but nobody considers these pairs as alternatives to each other. The fact that somebody does not know or respect orthography of the language doesn't constitute his creations to be "alternative". Fourth: By keeping the "alternative spelling" instead of "mmisspelling" you (plural) are telling to people (mostly foreigners) that they ''can'' use such form. But that is not true. They are not supposed to, because those are not correct forms but misspellings both by definition and morphology. So you (plural) give heavily misleading information. And last but not least: Even hundred times repeated incorrectness won't become correct. Nobody can not change reality by pushing his/her POV which does not ''describe'' it. If you (plural) are OK with keeping factual mistakes on English Wiktionary, then it's your (plural) choice, but it devalues the English Wiktionary as a whole then.<br />In any case your (plural) behavior to de facto newcomers is very unwelcoming and instead of helping out with explaining and pointing to explanatory places you (plural) simply blindly revert without stating a reason or even protect.

:{{Re|Daniel Carrero}} Just a piece of advice: You better not trust Danny B.

And for the record, he was repeatedly and by many users asked to have his adminship confirmed or to resign but he blatantly ignored all such requests. After our community finally had admin vote rules and he was forced to confirm his adminship, he totally [[:cs:Wikislovník:Správci/Potvrzení práv správce Danny B.|failed in doing so]].

Well, since Auvajs pulled the local dirt here, I have to put it in the context then:
# At first, it should be mentioned that Auvajs is massive (talking about many tens) sockpuppetter on several projects, banned from the Czech Wikipedia because of that. Even nowadays he is still using various accounts.
# Auvajs has personal antipathy to most of the admmins on Czech projects, simply because they are trying to enforce him to follow the rules which sometimes involves blocks.
# Auvajs has been banned for trolling in the form of taking quarrels from one project to the other. The post above and his recent contributions are clear evidence of trying to do the same here.
# Auvajs drove by his aggressive and offensive behavior many productive users off the project for good, which is also a reason why the confirmation he linked ended up such way.
# None of his statements above about myself not being voted are true, which is easily provable by checking the history of the project as well as considering the simple and obvious fact that stewards would not promote someone not voted.
Anyway, ''none of the things mentioned above are relevant'' to the current disputes of whether some words should be called alternative spelling or misspelling, so I would actually kindly suggest to remove this part of this section completely to prevent deployment of totally irrelevant discussion.<br />— [[User:Danny B.|Danny B.]] 01:09, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

: {{Re|Danny B.}} You "forgot" to mention several facts:

And you call it "enforcing to follow the rules" ? Pathetic. 3) I was banned indef by a friend of Danny B. on cs.wikisource after I posted a question to the local village pump if the site had any admin vote rules. If the site had admin votes rules they'd lose their rights so they banned me indef so that I couldn't make an effort to create them and they hold their rights forever.  See [[:meta:Requests for comment/cs.wikisource admins]]. 4) The truth is, most of Danny's supporters voted for him despite being long time inactive or very little active on the project. 5) So please provide evidence on the vote for you becoming cs.wiktionary bureaucrat :) --[[User:Auvajs|Auvajs]] ([[User talk:Auvajs|talk]]) 01:42, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

Since to me, it seems inappropriate that posts of one user are removed based on an email request by another user.

To complete the picture, Danny B. is a non-consensual admin (as witnessed by his volume removals of images) making almost no substantive contribution on any project of Wikimedia foundations. Recently, we was desysopped from the Czech Wiktionary as per [[:cs:Wikislovník:Správci/Potvrzení práv správce Danny B.]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:47, 15 October 2016 (UTC)

::: Short answer: Yes. Longer explanation: But [[WT:NORM]] was created as a result of [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2015/May#Voting on normalization of entries|this discussion]] from May 2015 with 13 polls, then one [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-05/Normalization of entries|vote]] that failed on July 2015, but finally served to create [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-07/Normalization of entries 2|this]] other vote that passed on September 2015. Later, it was revised by a few other votes, including [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-11/NORM: 10 proposals|this big one]] with 10 proposals, that ended on February 2016. So [[WT:NORM]] is pretty solid. Even if we find any inconsistencies between the old policy and [[WT:NORM]], these discussions and votes are my reason to believe that we should, naturally, follow NORM.
::: Some things that were in [[Wiktionary:Wikitext style]] but don't exist in [[WT:NORM]] nowadays include deprecated practices like linking all language names on translation tables that are ''not'' part of a "TOP40" list of major languages, and using separate gender templates: {{temp|m}} for masculine and {{temp|f}} for feminine. The old policy also included this rule: "In general, if a definition is a complete sentence, it should start with a capital and end with a period. If it is a word, list of words, or a phrase, it should not." but this is controversial to say the least, so it was mentioned in the aforementioned discussions and was hence removed (also if we ''had'' a rule like this, it would be covered in [[WT:EL]], not [[WT:NORM]], because it affects how the entries are presented to our readers) --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 08:23, 27 October 2016 (UTC)

==AWB edits to character boxes==

:Hello. As I had proposed in [[WT:RFDO#Template:character info]], my intention is basically deleting all templates like {{temp|Egyptian Hieroglyphs character info}}, {{temp|Combining Diacritical Marks character info}}, etc. The idea is using only {{temp|character info/new}}, which fills most parameters automatically. From what I saw, apparently many pages didn't have the <code>previous=</code> and <code>next=</code> parameters filled, but {{temp|character info/new}} fills that information automatically. A few had incorrect information like in [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%84&curid=3581975&diff=41558711&oldid=41509037 this diff].

When the charbox is above all language sections, like {{temp|also}}, it appears no matter what language you are seeing if you have TabbedLanguages enabled.

== Complete Wiktionary? ==

Hi, I'm relatively new to Wiktionary and I was taking my first look through the beer parlour. You mentioned that in [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2016/November#Favicon proposal]] that you wanted Wiktionary to be completed by the end of this year. Frankly, I'm kind of amazed and I just want to talk about it a little to get a sense of what completeness means. It's really cool that it could be complete! I've always just assumed that Wikimedia projects are an endless work in progress, but I guess everything has to finish eventually. How does one tell if Wiktionary is complete, and what happens when it is complete? Is it really realistic to finish before 2017? [[User:Icebob99|Icebob99]] ([[User talk:Icebob99|talk]]) 20:32, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|Icebob99}}: Actually, I was being sarcastic -- sometimes, people make jokes like saying "I'm going away from Wiktionary for a few weeks, please try to complete Wiktionary before I come back", but Wiktionary appears to be an endless work in progress, as you said. Setting aside the fact that new words and expressions are coined all the time, we would have to cover all words and expressions in all languages already created up to this point in time, with their etymologies, pronunciations, translations, etc. The entry [[water]] has translations in hundreds of languages, and basically all or most other entries should have translations in hundreds of languages too, I believe. Plus, all requests like "check current translations" and "clean up these entries" would have to be fulfilled too. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 20:48, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

==  [[:Category:Han script characters]] and halfwidth/fulllwidth characters ==

Why is {{temp|character info/new}} sorting a bunch of "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms" characters into [[:Category:Han script characters]]? —[[User:Suzukaze-c|suzukaze]] ([[User talk:Suzukaze-c|t]]・[[Special:Contributions/suzukaze-c|c]]) 16:49, 1 December 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|suzukaze-c}}: Apparently, this [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module:scripts/data&diff=24535418&oldid=24531004 edit] caused halfwidth and fullwidth characters (from fullwidth "!" to halfwidth circle) to be recognized as Hani characters. I removed that edit now, and this fixed the categorization. I'm pretty sure that when we had separate full/halfwidth entries, this caused the {{temp|head}} of these entries to be formatted as "Hani" automatically. The old entries were not categorized into any "X script categories" , because they did not have {{temp|character info/new}}. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 02:23, 2 December 2016 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Latin script characters]] ==

[[:Category:Latin script characters]] has a lot of characters that are not exclusive to the Latin script. They should be removed. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:26, 2 December 2016 (UTC)
:Allright. Can you tell me what characters, or groups of characters would you remove from that category? :If anything, I'd like to keep punctuation marks, including the ones that are used in multiple scripts. I believe the entry for the comma ('''[[,]]''') should be a member of both [[:Category:Latin script characters]] and [[:Category:Greek script characters]], at least. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 19:43, 2 December 2016 (UTC)
:: The entry for [[,]] should either be a member of (almost) every script category, or none of them (but perhaps a separate inter-script category). Latin and Greek are not special. This applies to the numbers, punctuation, various symbols and things, and probably any IPA characters and transliteration characters that are not used in any language's orthography. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 20:09, 2 December 2016 (UTC)
:::Ok, I understand. I attempted to remove the characters you mentioned by editing [[Module:scripts/data]]. Did I miss anything? --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 20:24, 2 December 2016 (UTC)
:::: I think it's good, but I don't know whether removing these characters from [[Module:scripts/data]] might have unintended consequences. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:52, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
::::: The entries affected (numbers, IPA, punctuation, etc) don't have the CSS class ".Latn" automatically applied anymore. But, ".Latn" is literally an empty class in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]], and does not seem to provide any additional formatting.
::::: If we create a new inter-script category as you mentioned, we may want to go all the way and create a new script-code and CSS class for inter-script. I'm thinking of using the code <code>Qint</code>, but I'm not sure how the categories could be named in a consistent way. [[:Category:Transcript script]]? I can't think of any good names right now. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:26, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
:::::: I think think they should be treated as Latin in the CSS, but not categorized as Latin characters. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:50, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

== Etymologies ==

We have many etymologies that are variously incomplete or poorly formatted, but your edits are sometimes making them worse: [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=phakoscope&diff=41818309&oldid=20579249]. Please be more careful. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 03:54, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
:Allright. Are there any other entries with problems like that? All my edits in etymologies with the "term cleanup" summary are supposed to improve the entries, and they are very similar. I replaced "etyl" by "der" and added "From" because the etym was starting with a language name. I forgot to add a "|" in that etymology, which would make "[term?]" appear because the Ancient Greek form was missing from the start and I don't speak Ancient Greek. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 04:01, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
::When I left this message, I hadn't noticed that the single pipe was the only problem. However, it does show that you didn't check the entry after editing it. Basically, I see these edits as having a very marginal positive effect, but the risk of careless editing causing somewhat larger negative effects. —[[User:Metaknowledge|Μετάknowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 23:23, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
:::I understand. I believe that entry was a one-time mistake. I'm taking care to check all entries. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 23:44, 4 December 2016 (UTC)

: The new preferred practice is to use {{para|t}} for glosses, rather than a positional parameter. That way, these mistakes would not happen. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:54, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
:: "|t=" seems allright; maybe it also makes it clearer the purpose of that parameter, as opposed to using unnamed parameters, even though I don't like that it is one character longer than "||" (which is not much, admittedly). I kinda have the feeling you guys are treating me like I've been careless and messed up Wiktionary irreparably. That's one mistake in the middle of 17,400+ entries in the "term cleanup" project as of now. I was not careless. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 18:15, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
::: It was a minor mistake, and I don't blame you (although you were equally careless when you went to try to fix it). I'm just trying to make sure everyone knows that {{para|t}} is the preferred parameter. The advantage of {{para|t}} is not in the number of characters you need to type, but in the fact that you can add and remove positional parameters without worrying about how many pipes are left. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 18:53, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
:::: Ok, I support using {{para|t}} as the preferred parameter, per the advantage that you said. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 21:20, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

== Wanted entries -- 出て来る ==

I just saw {{diff|41829959|text=your recent addition to Wanted Entries}}.  Generally speaking, in Japanese, if a verb in a group of verbs ends in ''-te'', it's independent.  {{lang|ja|出て来る}} is just {{m|ja|出て|tr=dete}}, the ''-te'' conjunctive conjugation of {{m|ja|出る|tr=deru||to come or go out, to exit, to move outwardly}}, followed by {{m|ja|来る|tr=kuru||to come, to move towards the speaker}} → “to come out”.  This is not a lexical item, but simply two words next to each other.  This construction could just as well be {{m|ja|出て}}{{m|ja|行く|tr=dete iku||to go out}}, or {{m|ja|落ちて}}{{m|ja|来る|tr=ochite kuru||to fall towards the speaker}}, or {{m|ja||帰って拾って連れて行って見てもらって寝かした|tr=kaette hirotte tsurete itte mite moratte nekashita}}, an extreme case of verb chaining that I actually heard from a native speaker, meaning essentially “I went back home and picked it up, took him with me, had him looked at, then put him to bed,” in reference to retrieving a pharmacy form and taking a young son to the doctor and then putting him down for his afternoon nap.  Consequently, I don't think {{lang|ja|出て来る}} merits an entry.  :)  ‑‑&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 05:28, 6 December 2016 (UTC)

Parce qu’effectivement, d’abord on était sur des termes purement et simplement racistes avec « bamboula, negro, nègre, bicot, bougnoule » et puis après ça a évolué et on est arrivé à « '''black''', beur »… Donc je sais pas quand est-ce que ça a commencé exactement, moi je marque ça aux années 80, le hip hop, voilà, la black music…

|passage=C’est qu’en France, les blancs n’existent pas et par contre la façon de parler des nonblancs existe et évolue avec le temps. Parce qu’effectivement, d’abord on était sur des termes purement et simplement racistes avec « bamboula, negro, nègre, bicot, bougnoule » et puis après ça a évolué et on est arrivé à « '''black''', beur »… Donc je sais pas quand est-ce que ça a commencé exactement, moi je marque ça aux années 80, le hip hop, voilà, la black music…
|translation=In France, there are no Whites, but names for non-Whites are constantly evolving. First we had terms that were purely and simply racist, like jigaboo, negro, nigger, coon, sambo... That evolved until we got to '''Black''', Brownie... I'm not sure when that came in, but I guess it was the 1980s, with hip-hop and "Black music."}}

{{lang|zh|《汉语拼音方案》}} (''Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet'') defines a standard pronunciation for each letter in Hanyu Pinyin with [[Zhuyin]]. {{m|zh|ㄝ|tr=-|ts=ɛ}} typically only occurs in syllables with an initial glide (e.g. {{m|zh||ㄧㄝ|tr=-ie|ts=i̯ɛ}}), where it is romanized as {{m|cmn|e}}. When it occurs in syllables without an initial glide, however, it is romanized as {{m-self|cmn|ê}} in order to distinguish it from {{m|zh|ㄜ|tr=-e|ts=ɤ}}. Such instances are rare, and are only found in interjections or neologisms.<noinclude>
