==Usage==
This template creates a conjugation table for all Arabic [[verb]]s.

This template should be placed in a conjugation section, headed by a ====Conjugation==== section header. The template automatically categorizes the entry into the appropriate Arabic verb subcategory (e.g. [[:Category:Arabic form IV verbs]]). Form-I verbs are also categorized according to the last vowel in the past and non-past, since these vowels vary from verb to verb (e.g. [[:Category:Arabic form-I verbs with past vowel a and non-past vowel u]]). Verbs that are conjugate geminate, such as form-X {{m|ar|اِسْتَرَدَّ}}, are categorized accordingly, in this case in [[:Category:Arabic geminate form-X verbs]]. If the verb is irregular, it will be categorized into [[:Category:Arabic irregular verbs]].

==Basic usage==
This template has a single required parameter, which is used to specify the verb form (I, II, III, ..., XV, as well as Iq ... IVq). For non-form-I verbs, often that is all that needs to be specified, although typically you should also specify whether there is a passive voice and if so, what type of passive (e.g. full passive, impersonal passive, passive-only, etc.). An example of a form-II verb ِis {{m|ar|رَدَّدَ||to repeat}}, which can be declared as {{tl|ar-conj|<II.pass>}}, where {{cd|<II.pass>}} is an '''angle-bracket spec''' and the parts of the angle-bracket spec between periods/full stops are called '''indicators'''. In this spec there are two indicators, {{cd|II}} (the verb form) and {{cd|pass}} (indicating that a full passive occurs). In practice, this is written just as {{tl|ar-conj|II.pass}}, since angle brackets can be omitted when the spec contains angle brackets at the beginning and end, and nowhere else. (Beware that if you embed a template like {{tl|m}} or {{tl|q}} in a footnote — see below for footnotes — you will need to use the form with explicit angle brackets, because {{tl|m}}, {{tl|q}} and several other templates generate HTML under the hood, which contains angle brackets that confuse the parser if the outer angle brackets have been omitted.)

Form-I verbs need extra information specified, including the past and non-past vowels as well as the verbal nouns (which are unpredictable) and in some cases the active participle(s), when they are unpredictable and do not follow the normal {{m|ar|فَاعِل}} pattern. A typical example is {{m|ar|كَتَبَ||to write}}, which might use the following spec: {{tl|ar-conj|I/a~u.pass.vn:كِتَابَة,كَتْب,كِتَاب}}. This contains three indicators, the first of which ({{cd|I/a~u}}) is a '''compound indicator''' that embeds several pieces of information, in this case the form ({{cd|I}}), the past vowel {{cd|a}} (i.e. ''kat<u>a</u>ba'', not #''katiba'' or ''katuba'') and the non-past vowel {{cd|u}} (i.e. ''yakt<u>u</u>bu'', not #''yaktibu'' or ''yaktaba''). The third indicator is also compound and is an '''override''', explicitly specifying the forms in a slot (in this case the verbal noun slot, whose abbreviation is {{cd|vn}}). This is needed for form-I verbs because there is no default verbal noun for these verbs.

You can also specify the verb explicitly, e.g. {{temp|ar-conj|ردد<II.pass>}}. This is useful on pages where the pagename is not the verb lemma, e.g. test and documentation pages as well as multiword expressions, which are described in more detail below. It is also used in {{tl|ar-verb form}}, which is used on pages describing non-lemma verb forms but takes the same syntax as {{tl|ar-conj}}.

==Non-form-I examples==
For the form-II verb {{m|ar|رَدَّدَ||to repeat}}, use {{tl|ar-conj|II.pass}} (as described above), which produces:
{{ar-conj|II.pass|pagename=ردد}}

For the form-VIII geminate verb {{m|ar|اِضْطَرَّ||to compel, to force}}, use {{tl|ar-conj|VIII.pass}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|VIII.pass|pagename=اضطر}}

Note that the module correctly knows how to conjugate all verb forms and weaknesses. In the above form-VIII verb, there are multiple possible jussive and imperative forms, all of which are generated and shown in the table.

For the form-X hollow hamzated verb {{m|ar|استضاء||to be lit; to seek enlightenment}}, use {{tl|ar-conj|X.II:و.ipass}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|X.II:و.ipass|pagename=استضاء}}
Here, {{cd|ipass}} indicates that the verb has only an impersonal passive (i.e. only third-person masculine singular forms exist) rather than a full passive, and {{cd|II:و}} specifies that the second radical is a {{lang|ar|و}} (wāw), which cannot be inferred from the lemma. Note that for non-form-I verbs, it's not strictly necessary to specify the non-inferrable second radical of hollow verbs or third radical of final-weak verbs, because it doesn't affect the conjugation. Doing so, however, allows the verbs to be correctly categorized by weak radical. For example, the above verb will be categorized into [[:Category:Arabic form-X verbs with و as second radical]].

Note also that the module knows the rules for determining the correct seat of hamzas, which follows complex rules and for which there are sometimes alternatives, as in the third-person masculine plural non-past indicative of the above verb, which is either {{m|ar||يَسْتَضِيئُونَ}} (with the hamza over a {{lang|ar|ي}}) or {{m|ar|يَسْتَضِيؤُونَ}} (with the hamza over a {{lang|ar|و}}).

==Form-I examples==
For form-I {{m|ar|كَتَبَ||to write}}, use {{tl|ar-conj|I/a~u.pass.vn:كِتَابَة,كَتْب,كِتَاب}} (as described above), which produces:
{{ar-conj|I/a~u.pass.vn:كِتَابَة,كَتْب,كِتَاب|pagename=كتب}}

For form-I {{m|ar|تَرَّ||to be cut off, to be severed}}, which has non-past vowel either ''u'' or ''i'', use {{tl|ar-conj|I/a~u,i.nopass.vn:تَرّ,تُرُور}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|I/a~u,i.nopass.vn:تَرّ,تُرُور|pagename=تر}}
Here, commas separate the different possible non-past vowels, and {{cd|nopass}} means there is no passive.

Form-I stative verbs (generally those whose past vowel is ''i'' or ''u'') typically have unpredictable active participles as well as verbal nouns, and both must be specified. An example is {{m|ar|تَلِفَ||to perish, to be spoiled}}, which uses {{tl|ar-conj|I/i~a.ipass.vn:تَلَف.ap:+,+++,+an}}, producing:
{{ar-conj|I/i~a.ipass.vn:تَلَف.ap:+,+++,+an|pagename=تلف}}
Here, there is both a verbal noun override specifying the verbal noun {{m|ar|تَلَف}} and an active participle override specifying three possible active participles. Because certain active participle patterns are very common, shortcuts are provided for them. Here, {{cd|+}} indicates the default {{m|ar||فَاعِل}} participle shape; {{cd|+++}} indicates the {{m|ar||فَعِل}} participle shape; and {{cd|+an}} indicates the {{m|ar||فَعْلَان}} participle shape. This is documented in more detail below.

If there is more than one possible combination of past/non-past vowels, but the combinations differ in both the past and non-past vowels, it is recommended to use multiple conjugation tables. An example is {{m|ar|رَفَقَ||to be kind; to be a friend}} with non-past vowel ''u'', which also occurs as {{m|ar|رَفِقَ}} with non-past vowel ''a'' and {{m|ar|رَفُقَ}} with non-past vowel ''u''. This would be written as follows:
<pre>
{{ar-conj|I/a~u.ipass.vn:رِفْق,مَرْفِق,مِرْفَق,مَرْفَق.ap:+,++}}
{{ar-conj|I/i~a.ipass.vn:رَفَق.ap:+,++}}
{{ar-conj|I/u~u.ipass.vn:رَفَاقَة,رِفْق.ap:++}}
</pre>
which produces
{{ar-conj|I/a~u.ipass.vn:رِفْق,مَرْفِق,مِرْفَق,مَرْفَق.ap:+,++|pagename=رفق}}
{{ar-conj|I/i~a.ipass.vn:رَفَق.ap:+,++|pagename=رفق}}
{{ar-conj|I/u~u.ipass.vn:رَفَاقَة,رِفْق.ap:++|pagename=رفق}}
Note that in this case, the different vowel patterns are also associated with different verbal nouns and (to some extent) different active participles.

In general, you '''must''' specify the past and non-past vowels for a form-I verb, or an error is thrown. There are only two exceptions: (1) passive-only verbs, and (2) final-weak verbs. An example of the latter is {{m|بَكَى||to cry; to weep over}}, which would be written {{tl|ar-conj|I.pass.vn:بُكَاء,بُكًى}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|I.pass.vn:بُكَاء,بُكًى|pagename=بكى}}
Here, the vowels are inferred as ''a~i'', consistent with the last letter of the unvocalized form. (Vowel pattern ''a~u'' ends in {{lang|ar|ا}} and vowel pattern ''i~a'' ends in {{lang|ar|ي}}.)

For form-I weak verbs, it is important to know the identity of all radicals, as it determines the form of the passive participles. This applies in particular to hollow and final-weak verbs. Most of the time, radical can be safely inferred from the non-past vowel, but this is not the case when the non-past vowel is ''a''. In this situation, the radical must be given or an error occurs. An example is {{m|ar|نَامَ||to sleep; to forget about}}, which has vowel pattern ''i~a'' and an impersonal passive, hence a passive participle ({{m|ar|مَنُوم}} since the second radical is {{lang|ar|و}}). For this verb, the second radical must be given explicitly or an error occurs. Thus it should be written {{tl|ar-conj|I/i~a.II:و.ipass.vn:نَوْم,مَنَام.ap:+}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|I/i~a.II:و.ipass.vn:نَوْم,مَنَام.ap:+|pagename=نام}}

A similar situation occurs with form-I final-weak verbs with vowel pattern ''i~a''. An example is {{m|ar|رَضِيَ||to please}}, which should be written {{tl|ar-conj|I.III:و.pass.vn:رِضًا,رِضًى,رِضْوَان,رُضْوَان,مَرْضَاة.pp:+,مَرْضِيّ}}, which produces:
{{ar-conj|I.III:و.pass.vn:رِضًا,رِضًى,رِضْوَان,رُضْوَان,مَرْضَاة.pp:+,مَرْضِيّ|pagename=رضي}}
Here, the last radical is {{lang|ar|و}}, leading to an expected passive participle {{m|ar|مَرْضُوّ}}. This does occur, but so does an analogical passive participle {{m|ar|مَرْضِيّ}}, so we list both using an override.

==Indicators==
This section gives full information on the indicators that can occur in {{para|1}}. Indicators are separated by a period ({{cd|.}}). The first indicator is required and specifies the verb form ({{cd|I}}, {{cd|II}}, etc.) and, for form-I verbs, the past and non-past vowels. Additional indicators are optional and can come in any order.

===Verb form and vowel indicator===
The first indicator is required and specifies the verb form: {{cd|I}}, {{cd|II}}, ... {{cd|XV}} or {{cd|Iq}} ... {{cd|IVq}}. See [[Appendix:Arabic verbs]] for more information. Non-form-I verbs just specify the indicator directly, but form-I verbs normally need to specify a ''compound indicator'' with additional information given:
# Rarely, the weakness needs to be explicitly given following a hyphen, i.e. either {{cd|I-assimilated}} or {{cd|I-sound}}. This occurs only with form-I verbs whose first radical is {{lang|ar|و}}, and even then fairly rarely. Specifically, form-I verbs whose first radical is {{lang|ar|و}} are assumed to be '''assimilated''' (i.e. they lose the {{lang|ar|و}} in the non-past) ''unless'' the vowel pattern is ''i~a'' or ''u~u'', in which case the verb is assumed to be '''sound''' (regular); in other words, the verb is assumed to be assimilated if the vowel pattern is ''a~u'', ''a~i'', ''a~a'' or ''i~i'' (or some weird pattern like ''i~u'' that is almost never seen and probably an error). This works correctly with almost all verbs, hence {{m|ar|وَهَرَ||to frighten}}, non-past {{m|ar|يَهِرُ||he frightens}} vs. {{m|ar|وَهِلَ||to be frightened}}, non-past {{m|ar|يَوْهَلُ||he is frightened}}. But a small number of verbs don't follow this pattern, and need the weakness explicitly given, such as {{m|ar|وَسِعَ||to be wide; to house, to accommodate}}, non-past {{m|ar|يَسَعُ||he is wide; he houses, he accommodates}} rather than expected but non-existent #{{m|ar||يَوْسَعُ}}. This verb would be specified as {{tl|ar-conj|I-assimilated/i~a.pass.vn:سَعَة.ap:+}}.
# In most cases, the past and non-past vowel need to be given following a slash, in the format e.g. {{cd|a~u}} for past vowel ''a'', non-past vowel ''u''; for example {{cd|I/a~u}}. Multiple comma-separated vowels can be given for either type of vowel, e.g. {{cd|a~u,i}} meaning past vowel ''a'' and non-past vowel either ''u'' or ''i''; or {{cd|a,u~u}} meaning past vowel either ''a'' or ''u'' and non-past vowel ''u''. As mentioned above, more complex patterns (e.g. either ''a~u'' or ''i~a'') should be specified using multiple conjugation templates. (It would be possible to extend the syntax to accomodate this but it would have to be displayed using multiple tables in any case, since the result of mixing all forms into a single table would be the equivalent of ''a,i~u,a'', which would be extremely misleading.) It is possible to attach a footnote to a given vowel, e.g. {{cd|a,u[rare]~u}} indicating that past vowel ''u'' specifically is rare; all forms involving this past vowel will bear the specified footnote. This is described below in more detail.

===Passive indicator===
Whether the verb has a passive voice and what sort of passive forms exist can be specified using one of the following passive-voice indicators:
* {{cd|pass}}: Verb has a full passive. Generally, all transitive verbs have a full passive. Verbs in [https://www.almaany.com/ Almaany] that have a full passive are generally shown with the passive participle after the word {{m|ar|مَفْعُول}}.
* {{cd|ipass}}: Verb has an impersonal passive. Generally, intransitive verbs with prepositional objects have an impersonal passive. Verbs in [https://www.almaany.com/ Almaany] that have a full passive are generally shown with the passive participle followed by a preposition + object (e.g. {{m|ar||بِهِ}}, {{m|ar|عَلَيْهِ}}) after the word {{m|ar|مَفْعُول}}.
* {{cd|nopass}}: Verb has no passive. Verbs in [https://www.almaany.com/ Almaany] that have a full passive are generally shown without any passive participle. (However, some verbs with full or impersonal passives are also missing passive participles, especially obsolete ones. Those with full passives contain example sentences with an object in the accusative, and those with impersonal passives either contain example sentences with prepositional objects or have the preposition listed after the lemma, i.e. past-tense, form of the verb.)
* {{cd|onlypass}}: Verb is passive-only, with a full passive.
* {{cd|onlypass-impers}}: Verb is passive-only, with an impersonal passive.

===Root consonant indicator===
For verbs with weak radicals, sometimes the radical cannot be inferred from the lemma form. In these cases, the radical can be explicitly given using one of the following indicators:
* {{cd|I:...}} to indicate the first radical; e.g. {{cd|I:و}} to indicate that the first radical is {{m|ar||و}}.
* {{cd|II:...}} to indicate the second radical; e.g. {{cd|II:و}} to indicate that the second radical is {{m|ar||و}}.
* {{cd|III:...}} to indicate the second radical; e.g. {{cd|III:ي}} to indicate that the third radical is {{m|ar||ي}}.
* {{cd|IV:...}} to indicate the fourth radical (only for quadriliteral verbs); e.g. {{cd|IV:ي}} to indicate that the fourth radical is {{m|ar||ي}}.
Radicals can be followed by transliteration after {{cd|//}}. For example, the verb {{m|ar|أَنْجَلَ|tr=ʔangala}} can be conjugated using {{cd|III:ج//g}}, indicating that the third radical is {{lang|ar|ج}}, which should be transliterated as ''g''.

===Slot overrides===
Individual slots can be overridden using an indicator {{cd|<var>slot</var>:<var>override</var>,<var>override</var>,...}}. Here {{cd|<var>slot</var>}} is the name of a slot, e.g. {{cd|vn}} for the verbal noun, {{cd|ap}} for the active participle, {{cd|pp}} for the passive participle, {{cd|past_1s}} for the first-person singular past, {{cd|juss_pass_3fp}} for the third-person feminine plural non-past jussive passive, etc. This is followed by one or more comma-separated overrides (the Arabic comma {{cd|،}} can be used in place of a regular comma {{cd|,}}, but no space may follow the comma). An override can take the form {{cd|<var>arabic</var>//<var>translit</var>}} to specify both the Arabic script and equivalent transliteration, but this is rarely necessary.

The most likely slots you will find occasion to use are {{cd|vn}} for the verbal noun, {{cd|ap}} for the active participle and {{cd|pp}} for the passive participle. In particular, form I verbs have no default verbal noun and require such an override; form I stative verbs (those with past vowel ''i'' or ''u'') have no default active participle and likewise require an override; and many form III verbs have a second verbal noun of the {{m|ar||فِعَال}} form (appropriately adjusted for weak verbs), which requires an override to specify. To simplify specifying overrides, some shortcuts are available:
* {{cd|+}} works for all slots and explicitly requests the default value. (For this purpose, form-I stative verbs are considered to have a default participle of the {{m|ar||فَاعِل}} form, appropriately adjusted for weak verbs, like other form-I verbs.) This will throw an error for form-I verbal nouns, which have no default.
* {{cd|++}} works for some participles and verbal nouns and requests the "secondary" default value. Specifically, the secondary default for form-I active and passive participles is of the {{m|ar||فَعِيل}} form, and the secondary default for form-III verbal nouns is of the {{m|ar||فِعَال}} form. Other slots and conjugation forms have no secondary default. Note that all default values are appropriately adjusted for weak verbs. This means, for example, that the {{m|ar||فَاعِل}} form automatically becomes {{m|ar||فَائِل}} for hollow verbs, {{m|ar||فَاعٍ}} for final-weak verbs, {{m|ar||فَالّ}} for geminate verbs, etc.
* {{cd|+++}} for form-I active participles requests the secondary stative default value, of the {{m|ar|فَعِل}} form.
* {{cd|+cd}} for form-I active participles requests the "color/defect" default value, of the {{m|ar|أفْعَل}} form.
* {{cd|+an}} for form-I active participles requests the "-ān" (characteristic) default value, of the {{m|ar|فَعْلَان}} form.
You can freely mix shortcuts and fully specified overrides.

Each slot override can be followed by footnotes of the form {{cd|[footnote]}} and/or inline modifiers of various sorts. The possible inline modifiers are:
* {{cd|<id:...>}}: Specify a sense ID to link to (see {{tl|senseid}} and {{tl|l}}).
* {{cd|<t:...> or <gloss:...>}}: Specify a gloss for the override.
* {{cd|<q:...>}}: Specify a left qualifier for the override. Rarely needed.
* {{cd|<qq:...>}}: Specify a right qualifier for the override. Rarely needed.
* {{cd|<l:...>}}: Specify one or more comma-separated left labels for the override. Rarely needed.
* {{cd|<ll:...>}}: Specify one or more comma-separated right labels for the override. Rarely needed.
* {{cd|<pos:...>}}: Specify a part of speech for the override. Rarely if ever needed.
* {{cd|<g:...>}}: Specify one or more comma-separated genders for the override. Rarely if ever needed.
* {{cd|<lit:...>}}: Specify a literal meaning for the override. Rarely if ever needed.

==Additional parameters==
Most of the information is encoded in {{para|1}}. The other parameters are:
* {{para|t}}: Specify a gloss for this verb conjugation as a whole. Useful if there are multiple verb conjugations of a given verb (conjugation) form under a given lemma. Ignored except by {{tl|ar-verb form}}, where it is displayed next to verb forms derived from that verb conjugation.
* {{para|id}}: Specify an ID for this verb conjugation as a whole. Useful if there are multiple verb conjugations of a given verb (conjugation) form under a given lemma. Ignored except by {{tl|ar-verb form}}, where it can be used to select a subset of conjugations for extracting forms, using {{para|conjid}} or {{para|noconjid}}.
* {{para|pagename}}: Override the pagename of the verb lemma; normally taken from the actual pagename. Useful on testing and documentation pages.
* {{para|noautolinktext|1}}: Disable the autolinking algorithm for text outside of the verb itself, in multiword expressions.
* {{para|noautolinkverb|1}}: Disable the autolinking algorithm for the verb. If you use both this and {{para|noautolinktext|1}}, no autolinking will happen, with the result that non-lemma forms will be linked in their entirety in the table.
* {{para|json|1}}: Instead of outputting a table, output a JSON representation of all the inflected forms. Used by bots.

==Examples==

===Regular verbs, including those with consonant alternations===

1. The verb {{m|ca|cantar||to sing}} is fully regular. Use as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|cantar}}

2. The verb {{m|ca|pagar||to pay}} is regular other than having a predictable spelling change to ''gu'' in various forms. This is handled automatically, so no parameters are needed. Use as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|pagar}}

3. The verb {{m|ca|distribuir||to distribute}} is regular other than having a predictable addition of a diaeresis over the i (i.e. ''ï'') in certain forms, such as the first-person plural present indicative ''distribuïm''. This is handled automatically, so no parameters are needed. Use as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|distribuir}}

===Irregular verbs===

The module knows how to conjugate all irregular verbs, including compounds such as {{m|ca|mantenir}} and {{m|ca|endur-se}}, and no parameters are needed for them.

1. For example, the verb {{m|ca|dir||to say}} has various irregularities: present tense {{m|ca|dic}}, preterite {{m|ca|diguí}}, past participle {{m|ca|dit}}, imperative {{m|ca|digues}}, etc. Specify simply as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|dir}}

2. The verb {{m|ca|acudir||to attend; to come to mind}} has two conjugations in the present indicative and subjunctive, e.g. third person singular ''acudeix'' or ''acut''. These tend to be used differently according to the meaning, with ''acudeix'' usually used in the sense "to attend" and ''acut'' in the sense "to come to mind". The module knows about this, so specify simply as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|acudir}}

Here, a footnote is automatically added to indicate the different usages.

===Defective verbs===

Certain verbs are ''defective'', i.e. are missing some forms. Indicators are available to specify this. For example, the verb {{m|ca|caldre||to be necessary}} is an impersonal verb, with only 3rd-person singular verbs and no imperative. Specify as follows:
:{{temp|ca-conj|<only3s>}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|caldre<only3s>}}
Here, <code><only3s></code> means "only third-person singular".

===Variant conjugations===
A few verbs can be conjugated in more than one fashion depending on the meaning. Specify as follows:

# {{m|ca|coure}} means either "to cook" (past participle ''cuit'') or "to sting" (past participle ''cogut''). Specify this using a ''variant indicator'', specifically {{tl|ca-conj|<var:cook>}} or {{tl|ca-conj|<var:sting>}}.
# {{m|ca|haver}} is either an auxiliary verb used to form perfect tenses, or a full verb with the meaning "to possess". These uses are conjugated differently; in both cases the conjugations are highly irregular. Specify this using a ''variant indicator'' as above, specifically {{tl|ca-conj|<var:aux>}} or {{tl|ca-conj|<var:full>}}.
# {{m|ca|lluir}} is conjugated either a regular inchoative ''-ir'' verb meaning "to display; to be popular/successful {{q|of a person}}", or an irregular "pure ''-ir''" verb meaning "to shine". Specify the latter with no parameters, i.e. {{tl|ca-conj}}, and the former using {{tl|ca-conj|<no_built_in>}}. Here, the {{lua|no_built_in}} indicator specifies that the special handling as an irregular ("built-in") verb should be disregarded, and the verb conjugated regularly.

==Parameters==
The allowed parameters are as follows:

; {{para|1}}
: Optional specification of the verb and/or indicators controlling unpredictable parts of the conjugation. See above.

==Multiword expressions==
For multiword expressions, place angle brackets after the verb(s) needing conjugation, with any indicators inside angle brackets as needed. This is not actually necessary if there is only a single verb that is the first word of the expression, as is common.

1. For example, for the idiom {{m|ca|fer caput||to kill, to off}}, both of the following work and are equivalent:
:{{temp|ca-conj}}
:{{temp|ca-conj|fer<> caput}}
which produce

{{ca-conj|fer<> caput}}

2. The expression {{m|ca|retallar i enganxar||to [[cut and paste]]}} has more than one conjugated verb. Place angle brackets after each:
:{{temp|ca-conj|retallar<> i enganxar<>}}
which produces

{{ca-conj|retallar<> i enganxar<>}}

3. Normally, each word (including the verb) is autolinked separately. You can override the linking behavior by explicitly specifying links, as in {{m|ca|donar voltes||to [[go round in circles]]}}, which can be written as follows:
:<code><nowiki>{{ca-conj|donar<> [[volta|voltes]]}}</nowiki></code>
which produces

{{ca-conj|donar<> [[volta|voltes]]}}
In this case, the singular of {{m|ca|voltes}} is explicitly linked. The verb does not explicitly need a link, however, because verbs and uninflected portions of the expression are autolinked separately.
