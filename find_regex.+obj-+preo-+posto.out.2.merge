There are many pages for idioms with a placeholder term as ''jemanden, etwas'' to indicate transitivity. I have already moved some of them to ''jemanden''-less page titles and tagged the redirects to be speedy-deleted. But an IP wants to keep them. Do we really want those redirects? We don't have ''jemanden sehen'', ''jemanden gr√º√üen'', ''etwas schlagen''. The information regarding governance can be given in labels and usage notes. --[[User:Akletos|Akletos]] ([[User talk:Akletos|talk]]) 06:06, 24 December 2020 (UTC)

* <del>'''Abstain'''. Having jemanden there could be useful for a beginning German learner. However, [[vom rechten Weg abbringen]] gets it right on its own. I'd need a bit more convincing from the people who want to keep it.</del> &mdash; [[User:Dentonius|Dentonius]] 11:57, 24 December 2020 (UTC)
* {{reply|Akletos}} We don't have ''jemanden sehen'', etc. indeed, but I don't think that's a good comparison. No one would look for an entry under that title, and no dictionary does that, so there's no reason for us to do it either.
:With multiword verb phrases, however, some people ''do'' expect to have a placeholder in the title, probably because in some cases, omitting it leads to awkward results. Take {{m|de|sich bei jemandem lieb Kind machen}}, for example: would you suggest moving it to {{m|de|sich bei lieb Kind machen}}?
:So now you have cases where the placeholder is omitted, other cases where it's there. This is likely to cause confusion, especially for newcomers who may not know what the logic behind it is (we're not consistent anyway), and who don't necessarily check that an entry already exists under another title. 
:For example, imagine someone decides to draw up a list from [[:de:Kategorie:Redewendung (Deutsch)]] to create entries here. If you delete redirects, [[:de:jemanden vom rechten Weg abbringen]] will appear as a red link here, and that person, not knowing that we already have an entry at [[vom rechten Weg abbringen]], might decide to create a new one.
:So yes, I think we should '''keep''' those redirects. They don't harm, and they can help us avoid duplicates. [[Special:Contributions/2A02:2788:A4:205:4D65:3CFF:247C:BFF9|2A02:2788:A4:205:4D65:3CFF:247C:BFF9]] 12:21, 24 December 2020 (UTC)

:: Ok, I'm convinced, thanks to all of you for your input; let's '''keep''' them as redirects if they do no harm. (And besides, there are the same (or even bigger) inconsistencies in de-wt, so if we want interwiki-links we need both kinds of page titles.) If someone wants to re-add the ones already deleted have a look at [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Akletos my contributions on Dec 22]. I'll move the remaining phrases with indef pronouns in the next couple of weeks, leaving redirects.

::: {{reply|Akletos}} We do have {{temp|indtr}} (see {{cog|fr|tenir compte}}, for example), but it's not enough for languages with declensions, because you cannot document which case is needed. {{temp|+obj}}, {{temp|+preo}} and {{temp|+posto}} might be of use, but they're not widely used and I find them messy.

Isn't it pretty transparent and also covered at ''[[sift]]''? --[[User:Robbie SWE|Robbie SWE]] ([[User talk:Robbie SWE|talk]]) 07:18, 28 November 2018 (UTC)
* Yes. '''Delete'''. ‚Äî [[User:Sgconlaw|SGconlaw]] ([[User talk:Sgconlaw|talk]]) 07:57, 28 November 2018 (UTC)
* '''Keep''', I think. No reference is made to "sift through" at {{m|en|sift}}, the most likely place is sense 3. When sifting something like flour, which my mother used to do, "through" isn't normally used, even though the flour goes ''through'' a sieve. ''[[User:Donnanz|DonnanZ]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 10:29, 28 November 2018 (UTC)''
** Yes, sense 3 ("to examine carefully"). ''Sift through'' is simply "to go through while examining carefully". I think it would be adequate to give a usage example. ‚Äî [[User:Sgconlaw|SGconlaw]] ([[User talk:Sgconlaw|talk]]) 10:36, 28 November 2018 (UTC)
::: This entry could be incorporated there as a ''subsense'' rather than lose it completely. ''[[User:Donnanz|DonnanZ]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 10:58, 28 November 2018 (UTC)''
::::Certainly the meanings are close, though I think the def "examine carefully" is wanting. In any case, I think we need to treat ''sift through'' in somewhere, somehow, since this is the most common collocation/usage now, whereas ''sift'' with a direct object (to "sift the evidence" for example) is much less common. I originally added this entry as I wanted to be able to use it in the def for "sieve through" which is the Singapore English variant of "sift through" (e'en though I haven't gotten around to adding that yet). - [[User:Sonofcawdrey|Sonofcawdrey]] ([[User talk:Sonofcawdrey|talk]]) 04:44, 29 November 2018 (UTC)
: '''Delete'''/'''hard redirect''' as it is not special enough not to be SOP. One can form such things with {{m|en|through}} many verbs and one expression being more common does not make it non-SOP. It is just the verb having two different ways of government. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 11:38, 29 November 2018 (UTC)
:: Note also that ''sieben durch'', ''durch etwas sieben'' in German would be SOP, unlike {{m|de|durchsieben}} (in both stresses). This here is the very same. It‚Äôs just been created because of helplessness about adding the government with {{m|en|through}} at {{m|en|sift}} in a fair fashion.
:: So I added the government in {{revision|50992209|this ''sift'' revision}}. Wiktionary can peruse much more addenda regarding the regimina of verbs ‚Äì especially if formatted smartly, which currently is not so easy. I like the templates {{temp|+preo}} and {{temp|+obj}} quite and one could make the dictionary much more usable and competitive if one were to combine multiple governments at once (on which further discussion should take place at [[Module talk:object usage]], {{ping|Rua|Erutuon}}) [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 12:01, 29 November 2018 (UTC)
::: Thanks {{ping|Fay Freak}} for alerting me to those templates which I did not know existed. I have preliminarily re-edited the entry to split the two defs since one is trans (and archaic) and the other intrans (and current), and have used the +preo template. I didn't think it was necessary to keep {{temp|+obj}} for the orig. def since the "(something)" in the def makes it clear enough. That said, with the +preo template, the object is actually an indirect object (i.e. it is not sifting something(obj) through a sieve, just sifting through something), but I suppose the entry is clear enough now. Finally, also, the phrase "sift through" needs a hard redirect (sorry, dunno how to do that). - [[User:Sonofcawdrey|Sonofcawdrey]] ([[User talk:Sonofcawdrey|talk]]) 19:13, 29 November 2018 (UTC)
:::: {{ping|Sonofcawdrey}} But that‚Äôs not what ‚Äútransitive‚Äù means. ‚ÄùTransitivity‚Äù can be mediated through prepositions. It is purely semantical. On Wiktionary {{m|en|transitive}}¬†is glossed as ‚Äútakes an object‚Äù, and what have you written? ‚Äú(intransitive) [+ through (object)]‚Äù ‚Äì a paradox. It is not an indirect object either but a prepositional object. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 20:39, 29 November 2018 (UTC)
:::: {{ping|Fay Freak}} Yeah, you're right, I was only thinking that as I walked to work this morning. Still, the def "examine carefully" is substitutable for the orig. "sift" examples, but not for "sift through" (you can't "examine carefully through something"); so I have re-edited again. Other dicts make a point of mentioning the "through" construction as well. - [[User:Sonofcawdrey|Sonofcawdrey]] ([[User talk:Sonofcawdrey|talk]]) 01:46, 30 November 2018 (UTC)

Last thing: it seems a bit messy to me to use {{temp|lb}} for direct transitive and intransitive verbs, but this one for indirect transitives. Have you considered expanding the scope of this template and moving all the transitivity labels from {{temp|lb}} to it?

::: {{ping|Barytonesis}}, it‚Äôs done: {{diff|48097553}}. Let me know if you come across any bug or if you can think of a less clunky notation.
::: Do you mean categorising labels like ''archaic'' and ''geography''? It already does that (use . before the label). Or do you mean creating categories like ''French indirect transitive verbs with de''? It can be done. I was planning on doing that for Portuguese once there were a few hundred entries using it.
::: I think that the ideal solution would be moving this sort of information (transitivity/verb parameters, sematic categories of objects, etc., and also other POS, like nouns that always take an article) to usage notes in the same sub-definition position as usage examples. ‚Äî ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|falai]])</sup>'' 13:40, 16 November 2017 (UTC)
::::{{reply|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV}} yes, grammatical categories, like "French indirect transitive verbs with de". To be honest, I don't think topical categories should be allowed to work with this template, we already have {{temp|lb}} for that.
::::And yes, that sounds like a good idea! As I've said elsewhere, I don't like the way we're currently mixing grammatical, topical, contextual and register labels in the same place, with the same template (i.e. {{temp|lb}}), but doing {{revision|48032820|this}} is unsightly, so it ''has'' to be moved somewhere else.

==Adjectives==
{{ping|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV}}: Hello. It's just crossed my mind that it could be useful to have a similar template for [[valent]] adjectives: {{m|en|dependent}} ''on'', {{m|en|prone}} ''to'', {{m|en|different}} ''from''/''to''. --[[User:Per utramque cavernam|Per]] [[User talk:Per utramque cavernam|utramque]] [[Special:Contributions/Per_utramque_cavernam|cavernam]] 16:52, 29 May 2018 (UTC)
: That‚Äôs right. Again, the ultimate solution would be creating a usex-level template to show how the term is used with other words.
: Note that some of these adjectives have entries of their own ({{m|en|prone to}}). ‚Äî ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|falai]])</sup>'' 18:18, 29 May 2018 (UTC)

==Script handling==
I have just found out that this template exists, and also that it cannot be used in Arabic entries as it does not give the correct link or formatting as¬†{{temp|l}} etc. do, hence <code><nowiki>{{indtr|ar|ÿ®Ÿê}}</nowiki></code> in {{m|ar|ÿ™Ÿéÿ™Ÿéÿ±ŸéŸëÿ≥Ÿé}} links to {{m|ar||ÿ®Ÿê}} (a page with diacritic in the page name which must not exist), and the passed adpositions do not look good as for the glyphs, as well as the HTML of course does not mark the adpositions with language codes. This template would seem to me like a smart way to combine {{temp|lb|transitive}} and {{temp|+preo}}. Also should there be a {{temp|tindtr}} variant as sometimes for multiple meanings one would put all into {{temp|tlb}}?

KeœÜr, thank you.  I did as you suggested.  Please let me know if you see any other things that need to be corrected.  I'm a newbie and want to make sure I'm not making a mistake that later will have to be rectified for hundreds of words. I hope you see this; I am trying to figure out where to answer you.

For now I think it's best if you look to the existing things (entries, categories) for other languages, and then copy it and modify it to suit your language. For example, if you ever want to create [[:Category:Wauja numerals]], then you can look at the contents of [[:Category:English numerals]] for an example, and copy the code that is there while changing the language code. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 21:56, 14 August 2014 (UTC)

: First of all, Wiktionary is case sensitive, so edits to [[wauja]] have no effect on links to [[Wauja]].

Thank you for answering my question before I even had time to ask it! Also, thanks very much for advising me about where to put various types of information. I want to make sure I understand your comment. Which extra information are you referring to? Are you referring to the Usage Notes on Wauja Numerals I posted about 1 minute ago on this page: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Wauja_numerals ? The Wauja have only about a dozen cardinal numbers. For each entry, I wanted to include a link back to the general usage notes on numbers. If this is not the correct place for me to ask such questions, please let me know.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 15:36, 15 August 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the helpful advice. I will move the explanatory content from the Category page to an appendix page. Regarding using a template: is it considered bad form to include the same info on multiple pages? Because the explanation of how the Wauja use numbers is a fairly long paragraph. Should I simply put that paragraph on an appendix page and link to it from all the cardinal number lemma pages? Or is it OK to have the same thing appear on every cardinal number lemma page?

Thank you for the example, Ungoliant. Yes, I think I will make a template. The Wauja are much less reliant on numbers than are speakers of English, and that needs to be put in context. Their language is very rich and complex, but in their daily life, they traditionally had little need for numbers above five. During the past generation, however, they have been brought into the Brazilian cash economy to some degree, and this has suddenly created a linguistic need for using and understanding numbers in the hundreds and thousands. It will be interesting to see how the young generation of Wauja handles this.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 16:47, 15 August 2014 (UTC)

== {{m|wau|yanumaka}} ==

Friendly advice, per [[WT:WWIN]] "Wikitionary is not Wikipedia". Specifically, a lot of the content you added in this (particularly the culture section) does not belong in a dictionary. It may be of use on Wikipedia though. :) [[User: PalkiaX50]] <sup>[[User Talk: PalkiaX50|talk to meh]]</sup> 21:03, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

I understand. I'll remove it. Certainly the history of jaguars in relation to the community should go elsewhere. But it seems there are some gray areas here. I think that to understand the meaning of the word ''jaguar'' [[yanumaka]] in Wauja, it is relevant to know that the jaguar is a symbol of inherited chiefly rank. It is not a definition of the word, but a symbolic association that is so important that jaguar ornaments are used to convey a message to all who visit the village that a certain man is the chief. In other words, the Wauja word has strong symbolic associations that the English word does not. These symbolic associations are not literal definitions of the word. Nonetheless, I understand the need to respect the culture of Wiktionary, and will remove all the historical and cultural material. If I put the cultural material in Wiktionary, is there any way to keep it in one grouping by culture, comparable to a grouping by language in Wiktionary? Thanks.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:05, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
: Would a definition like this work for [[yanumaka]]? # {{temp|label|wau|figuratively}} [[chief]], [[leader]] ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:12, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

Well, that's an interesting question. The problem is, you would never say, "He's a yanumaka." or "He's like a yanumaka." Grammatically, you could construct such a sentence, but it wouldn't make sense to a Wauja. That is simply not a way the word can be used. However, Wauja can -- and do -- sing verses that are ostensibly about jaguars, but that everyone listening knows is in direct reference to the chief and no one else. I think I need to have a separate space, outside Wiktionary, where I can elaborate such things. The problem is, I can put up a site in WordPress, but after I'm gone, it will not persist. I guess a book would make the record permanent, but the Wauja themselves (and indigenous people generally) use the Internet much more than books. Also, the things I am removing from [[yanumaka]] are the very things that the Wauja themselves would think were important and want to keep in. I do understand, however, that Wiktionary can't be everything to everyone. Is there a way to use Wikipedia as a place to record ethnographic information about the Wauja in English, Portuguese, and Wauja? The idea is to have the information equally accessible to Wauja and non-Wauja. Academic ethnographies printed in books are not nearly as accessible as web pages that are maintained by a community.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:46, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

: Such poetic allusions happen in every language, even English. Medieval European texts are full of such symbolism. So is Shakespeare for that matter, and many religious texts. But even modern texts are full of references that are assumed understood. Understanding them requires understanding the context, the culture in which it was written. Because we live in the culture they're written in, we don't even realise that they might be incomprehensible to someone else, because it's obvious to us. I don't know if that means it's lexically significant to include it in a dictionary entry, though. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:38, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

One thing occurs to me... for endangered languages, Wiktionary is an important linguistic a cultural revitalization tool.  Could there be a way to allow (for endangered languages, at least) to include cultural and historic information that could be hidden if the user preferred not to see them?  Because endangered languages have so little content written in them or about them.  It's mostly bibles or inscrutable linguistic treatises by non-native speakers.

My current plan is to get a thousand words in the Eng/Wauja site, and then start setting up Eng/Port, and keep adding to both sites. Next year, I will be visiting the community and training young people to work on their own incubator site, all in Wauja. If historic and cultural information cannot be included in the English/Wauja and Portuguese/Wauja sites, could it perhaps be included in the all-Wauja site? Because that would be of much greater benefit to the Wauja community. Thanks for any ideas you can offer.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:46, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

: You might check out Wikibooks. I hope my edit didn't come as too much of a shock, but I wanted to show what a typical dictionary entry would be like. There's room for some of the stuff I removed to be incorporated into the definition or perhaps a usage note, but the important thing to remember is that dictionaries are about the words, not the things the words refer to.[[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 22:47, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for providing an example.  Is it considered bad form to provide external links to more information?[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:55, 17 August 2014 (UTC) 
: It's ok, within reason. Links to sister projects- including Wikibooks- are routine. As for other sites, subject-matter links should be used sparingly, but are ok as long as they don't dominate the entry. Since we're so limited in our scope, it can be helpful to link to more comprehensive sources. I removed your references mostly because they seemed to be for the purpose of backing up the encyclopedic content rather than as sources for further information. Since Wiktionary is usage-based, rather than authority-based, there's normally no need to include references for definitions, except examples of usage. With less-documented languages such as this, though, there may be no usage in citeable form, so a dictionary will do. It's also routine to link to authoritative dictionaries, lexicons, etc. to give more information on a term. The only external links that are inherently bad form are to commercial and ideological sites that are trying to sell something or to push an agenda. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 23:44, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
Regarding Shakespeare, you are right, all languages and cultures make use of symbolism. I guess I would say that if the cultural context is radically different, you need more explanatory notes. You need lots of notes to read Chaucer, even more for Beowulf. Without explanatory notes, it doesn't make much sense.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:51, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
: But "different" is relative, and Wiktionary tries to be agnostic about that. It's aimed at English ''speakers'', but not necessarily people born and raised in Anglo-Saxon-Norman culture. People in India will make very different allusions and references that a speaker in Scotland might not understand, despite it being English. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 23:16, 17 August 2014 (UTC)

== Some notes ==

I made some changes to [[-naun]].
# I wrapped the definition in the template {{temp|n-g}}, which is short for {{temp|non-gloss definition}}. This template should be used when the definition is not actually a meaning but more of a description of what something is or how something is used.
# I also changed the headings; according to [[WT:ELE]] (the main policy for entry layout), headings should only have the first word capitalized, and certain headings should be level 4 (with ====).
# I added a <code>cat2=</code> parameter to the {{temp|head}} template. This simply tells it to add a second category to the entry. In this case I've added [[:Category:Wauja inflectional suffixes]], which seems fitting because this is apparently a plural suffix. There are also categories for other types of suffix depending on what kind of words they form, such as [[:Category:English noun-forming suffixes]].

I also have some notes about the long list of related terms.
# Words that are actually derived from something use the "Derived terms" heading instead.
# For suffixes, you can also use this instead of listing all the terms manually. On a line right below the "Derived terms" header, write: {{temp|suffixsee|wau}}. This will automatically show a list of all the pages in [[:Category:Wauja words suffixed with -naun]], which is much easier than having to maintain the list manually.
# More importantly though, if this is simply an inflectional suffix, then it is probably better not to use a category for it at all. We don't put all the English plural noun forms into [[:Category:English words suffixed with -s]]; just imagine how big such a category would be! So what I would recommend is to use this on the entry [[yamukunauntope]]: {{temp|affix|wau|yamukunaun|t1{{=}}children|-tope|t2{{=}}all, every}}. After all the word was formed by adding -tope to the plural, not by first creating the plural. The plural already existed before.
‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 02:12, 12 November 2014 (UTC)

Yes you are right on all counts. This is very helpful. I will remove the list of words and put it in my personal "words to post" list. Then the words will show up on the appropriate category page.  The list is somewhat useful (unlike a list of English words suffixed with -s) because only a few categories of nouns can take plural at all. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 02:55, 12 November 2014 (UTC)

I changed the Etymology for yamukunauntope as suggested. Makes more sense this way. People can still find the singular if they care to do so.[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 03:00, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
: An alternative you could try is, instead of categorising the plural forms, categorise the singular. Many languages divide lemmas of words based on the type of inflected forms they take. For example, there's [[:Category:Dutch nouns with plural in -en]], [[:Category:Finnish kala-type nominals]] or [[:Category:Latin second conjugation verbs]]. So if you think it's better, you can make a category like [[:Category:Wauja nouns with plural in -naun]] or if you don't need to be specific, [[:Category:Wauja nouns with plural]]. There is no ready-made category for this, so you'll have to add the parent categories yourself if you create it. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 03:04, 12 November 2014 (UTC)

Thanks, that sounds like a very good idea. I noticed that some of my -naun plurals (seen here https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Wauja_non-lemma_forms) are not showing up on the page "Wauja words suffixed with -naun" (at https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Wauja_words_suffixed_with_-naun) Shouldn't they be listed there, as with any other suffix? [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 03:18, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
: They don't just magically appear in such a category. You have to use a template that's designed to add them. That's what {{temp|suffix}} or {{temp|affix}} or {{temp|prefix}} does. Quite often, half of what templates do is add entries to categories. Some of them, such as {{temp|head}} can do quite a variety of categories, depending on the parameters, while others are very simple and straightforward.

== Question about adding a parameter to create a footer link to the other suffix category ==
One last question tonight -- I like [[yamukunauntope]] much better now with your edits. It's cleaner and more concise. However, at the bottom of the page, there's a link to "Wauja words suffixed with -tope," but no longer a link to "Wauja words suffixed with -naun". This word has two suffixes and it's good to keep track of that. Some words have three or more suffixes and it will be interesting to monitor which can combine with which, in what sequence, and which are never seen together. Is there some way I can add a parameter to one of the templates on the page that will not add anything to this entry except a link at the bottom: "Wauja words suffixed with -naun"? Thanks for all your advice. It is a challenge to keep up! [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 04:40, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
: There is no clear answer to this because it depends on how you interpret "suffixed with". So far, most people on Wiktionary have interpreted it to mean "this word was created by adding this suffix". In the case of [[yamukunauntope]], the suffix -naun was already there, so it wasn't created by adding it. Therefore it's not added to the category. There are probably some people who think that the categories should show all the affixes that a word ''contains'' rather than only those which were used to ''create'' the word from its parts. So this is really something that might need a Beer Parlour discussion first as there are probably a lot of arguments in favour of one approach or the other, and also many possible ways to solve it. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 14:46, 12 November 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for your comments, as always.

*  Re: examples for entry '''''aminya''''': I normally use fewer examples. In the case of this word, there is not a ready gloss in English. It can be translated many ways. I will look through the examples and see which, if any, are redundant and can be deleted or used for another lemma, instead. An important goal in contributing to Wiktionary is language sustainability for an endangered language and the people who speak it. For the grandchildren of today's fluent speakers, thorough documentation via examples is critical. Entries without examples are of minimal value, at best. From the perspective of endangered languages, the problem is not that there are too many documented examples, but that there are too few. Native North Americans who are working on language revitalization in their communities have impressed upon me that detailed examples, and variety of examples, are what is needed, along with good audio recordings. Your comment, however, suggests that "too many examples" is indeed a problem for Wiktionary admins, and I want to understand your concerns and abide by community norms. I had not considered, for instance, that 6K might be seen as a problem.  Is it a server load issue?  I understand that millions of 6K increments add up. In any case, I will make sure that my examples are not redundant.
** Have you looked into using something like {{temp|+obj}}? There is no documentation for it yet, but the syntax looks like {{temp|+obj|wau|infinitive|means=the negated activity}} = {{+obj|wau|infinitive|means=the negated activity}}. I think it would show the grammatical structure much more clearly and concisely than a series of examples (which for the reader, especially one not familiar with the language, essentially means guesswork) could. <span class="signature">‚Äî [[User:Kephir|KeœÜr]]</span> 06:07, 1 January 2015 (UTC)

* Re: adverb vs. particle: '''''aminya''''' is hard to pin down. I would say it's not a particle, since a particle is "a minor function word that has comparatively little meaning and does not inflect, in particular." This is not the case with '''''aminya,''''' a negator, which completely changes the meaning of the associated verb clause, and also makes the statement imperative or conditional. The closest English equivalents are "not" (an adverb) and "don't", "shouldn't", "mustn't", etc. (all verb constructions). It cannot be a verb, as it does not inflect. Of course, lack of inflection is not a property exclusive to particles.  I will ask Alexandra Aikhenvald, an authority on Arawak languages, how she advises that I label it.
** I think words that determine a verb's mood (especially in a visibly grammatical way) are typically labelled particles, since this quality is not typical of adverbs (even though you could argue that words like {{m|en|probably}} denote some kind of modality). English "mustn't", "shouldn't" and "don't" are contractions of an auxiliary verb and a particle. Maybe this is a "predicative" (I saw this part of speech proposed once for some language, it might have been Slovene)? Maybe a defective verb? How similar is this word to other (words that can doubtlessly be called) adverbs? Does it occupy the adverb slot in standard word order? Can it modify an adjective? Does it even make sense to apply "Indo-European" part of speech classification to Wauja? And so on. <span class="signature">‚Äî [[User:Kephir|KeœÜr]]</span> 06:07, 1 January 2015 (UTC)

* Re: request not to use "obligatory possession" as a category: OK, I'll abide by that.  I was under the impression that I could create custom categories, but apparently I was mistaken.  That being the case, is there any way that I can somehow tag or mark or categorize certain entries to allow me to sort them into a group, and see them listed together on one page, the same way you can do for suffixes?  An important feature of Arawak languages is that nouns fall into classes according to how they are inflected.  It would be useful to be able to click on a link and see several hundred nouns meeting certain criteria, then click another link to compare that group to another such set. Is that possible on Wiktionary? 
** I did not say that this sort of category is undesirable ‚Äî maybe it is. I am saying that it uses the wrong naming convention: prefixing by language ''code'' is reserved for ''topical'' categories, not ''grammatical'' ones.

*** Ah, thanks for the clarification. That's very different from the conventions I am familiar with as a web developer.

You put comments in there as a courtesy to the coders who may have to edit your work at a later date, so they can understand how you intended the code to be structured.  Clearly-commented code is one aspect of doing the job well. So I assumed the "edit summary" was supposed to contain a few words summarizing the edit I had just made.  Apparently this is not the case.  {{unsigned|Emi-Ireland|18:14, 2 January 2015 (UTC)}}

* Re: reference to non-published works: Wauja is an endangered language. To date, there are no published works (other than a few medical information leaflets) by native speakers written in Wauja. (There are bible translations written by English-speaking missionaries with translation assistance from Wauja speakers, but that is not the same as a bible written by a native speaker of Wauja.) The Wauja have a rich literary tradition, but it is oral. This means that all examples refer to utterances that are recorded and transcribed or, in recent years, gleaned from emails and other written electronic communications. I regularly communicate in written Wauja with native speakers via email, Skype, Facebook and Facebook IM. Since these short texts are written by the native speakers themselves, and not transcribed by me or another non-native-speaker, such email and Facebook IM communications are perhaps even  more authoritative than the other forms of reference I have used (such as transcripts of recordings by village elders, which I transcribed.)

You raise an important point, and I address it below. (I will think about your other points above and respond after speaking to some colleagues.)

==Understanding Constraints of Documenting Languages that have no Tradition of Writing==
===Existing references in Wauja===
I respect your desire to avoid any risk of invalid entries. That certainly is important, not only for this Wauja Wiktionary, but for the future of Wiktionary as a whole. With this in mind, the issue we must address together is that, for this endangered language, with its rich oral tradition, there are ‚Äî as yet ‚Äî no dictionaries or published works to cite. There are none. (Except perhaps for one 4-5 page pamphlet for health workers, written by native speakers, which I am using as a reference mainly for anatomical vocabulary. There are some problems even with that thin publication, as it was written in Portuguese by Brazilian doctors, and translated to Wauja by young Wauja health workers. I recall how difficult and awkward it was for them to translate bizarre concepts such as "the food pyramid" and "carbohydrates" into Wauja, which does not need or use these concepts, much less have vocabulary to describe them. The result, overall, is not an authoritative reference for the Wauja language.)

So although I would gladly follow your very reasonable advice ("a single citation will suffice, even a mention (i.e. from a dictionary)"), alas, I cannot, at least until the Wauja publish in their language. Does that mean the language should not be documented on Wiktionary? Of course not! All the more reason to document it. I am sure we agree on that. In fact, I believe that having a robust Wauja Wiktionary will make it more likely that the Wauja will publish in their language, and that we will be able to cite published works someday soon.

Let's agree on what we can use for references, given the issue we are facing ‚Äì a rich oral tradition, but the complete absence of published works authored by native speakers. Until now, I have relied mostly on:

# '''transcribed oral communications''' that have been recorded during public performances by skilled and linguistically authoritative storytellers and other elders and,
# '''written electronic communications''' produced by the first generation of literate native speakers of Wauja. These are written by young Wauja adults whose first language is Wauja, but who have learned Portuguese well enough to be sent out to the border towns to continue their formal education, whether high school or university.

===Which sources are most reliable and authoritative?===
Each of these sources has advantages and disadvantages. The audio recordings of elders speaking in public are very authoritative linguistically, but they represent only one kind of speech (formal). Typically, they are orations, and they underrepresent natural conversational patterns used in daily life. In addition, there is the problem of transcription. When I first transcribed these recordings thirty years ago, there were no literate Wauja at all, and so the transcription had to be done by a non-native speaker (me). I speak Wauja, but I am not a native speaker. Therefore, although I consider my transcripts worthy references (they have all been checked phonetically by native speakers), I consider emails from young literate Wauja in some ways more authoritative than anything I personally transcribe.

That's because even if I transcribe the sounds perfectly and translate the meaning perfectly (a tall order), I might well put the breaks between words in different places than a native speaker would do. In fact, because the current generation of Wauja speakers is the FIRST ever to read and write, I find that there is wide latitude in how different native-Wauja-speaking writers put the sounds of their language into written letters. Perhaps somewhat like the authors of old English texts, who often were not uniform in how they spelled words, so are the Wauja today in a protean  stage of adopting literacy. After all, they don't even have a dictionary.  (I'm trying to help them remedy that.) 

Yet, despite these minor inconsistencies, every written text by an articulate and knowledgeable native speaker is valuable because it is unfiltered by non-native speakers. I realize that people typically do not write emails carefully, and often misspell words. That's why I never use such communications unless I have specifically checked the spelling and the utterance with the author. Each utterance that has been checked is associated with a named person in the published lemma, and they know that. (The only exceptions are statements that must be anonymous because of their content, to avoid embarrasing any individual. I have not needed to do that yet, but I know that such instances will arise.)

===Request for suggestions I can implement===
I have responded in detail to your comment because I want to assure you that I fully share your concern that each Wiktionary entry be reliably and responsibly referenced. I hope that you now understand some of the constraints I am working under, given that there are no published works by native speakers. If you can suggest specific ways I can improve the way I reference entries, I would be grateful. Specifically, if carefully-checked written communications that I receive from articulate native speakers are not acceptable, please let me know what is. I feel uncomfortable giving greater priority to my own transcriptions than to written communications authored by native speakers. They are both valuable for documenting the language, but surely written artifacts produced entirely by native speakers and unfiltered by outsiders should not be discarded.

===Why Wiktionary is particularly important for endangered language communities===
I am very committed to documenting Wauja in Wiktionary, precisely because I want the Wauja themselves (and the world) to have full global access and fully shared opportunities to participate in this project. I want to abide by Wiktionary community norms, and I also hope the Wiktionary community will welcome the Wauja project, and allow the Wauja language to be documented, despite the lack of published works. Some of my academic colleagues are skeptical that Wiktionary is a good platform for what I am trying to do, saying that Wiktionary cannot accommodate the special requirements of documenting an endangered language. But I don't want another proprietary project on a proprietary platform that ultimately does not give native speakers full participation in building their own lexicon, and ultimately is inaccessible to the people who need it most. I want the three planned Wauja Wiktionary sites to show that you can have a globally-accessible open-source platform, full language-community participation from anywhere in the world, and outstanding scholarship.

I have been skyping the Wauja over the holidays, and they are very excited about the three-part project that we are planning: (1) the Wauja-English dictionary, already underway; (2) a Wauja-Portuguese dictionary (to be launched in 2015), and (3) a Wauja-Wauja dictionary with a Wauja interface (perhaps launched in 2016). Too often, despite the best intentions of outside linguists, speakers of endangered languages have not had access to tools that would allow them to participate fully in building their own lexicons. Wiktionary is the antidote to that.  But to make this possible, the Wiktionary community must understand that building a lexicon for an endangered language with an exclusively oral tradition requires methodologies that may be somewhat different from those suitable for languages with an established tradition of literacy.

In the summer of 2015, I will travel to Brazil to train a team of young lexicographers on Wiktionary norms and on how to post lemmas on the Wauja-Portuguese site.  This project will be led by a Wauja village schoolteacher who is also a third-year university student in Language and Literature at the state university near his reserve.  He and his colleagues, on their own initiative, have already convened a two-day open meeting on orthography, attended by members of all three villages, who patiently sat through two days of discussions on spelling, all while crammed into a single schoolroom in the sweltering heat. These people are committed! This meeting was convened precisely because newly-literate people are spelling things inconsistently. He and the other young schoolteachers are thrilled that they will be trained to manage the Wauja-Portuguese site, and ultimately build a Wauja-Wauja one (perhaps starting 2016).  They are amazed and delighted that there will be no printing and distribution costs as they create and maintain a digital dictionary that can be used in their bilingual curriculum.

===How Wiktionary and Endangered Languages can strengthen each other===
I am doing my very best with each entry I post, but I know that the Wauja eventually will suggest corrections and improvements to my contributions. That is as it should be. As the community gradually works out the details of their orthography, the spellings of certain entries will change. Those corrections will make the current site even better. In the meantime, if you see ways I can improve my methods, please give me specific suggestions that will contribute to the success of this project, and that take account of the special constraints of documenting a language that does not have a written tradition.  Wauja has a magnificent oral literary tradition, by the way. It's a shame I have to frame the discussion around whether they "lack writing," or whether their first hard-won attempts at writing, using email and other digital tools, are "acceptable" (to us) or not in documenting their own language. Instead, I respectfully request that we find ways to carefully and responsibly document everything that they '''''do''''' have, and in so doing, perhaps help them keep it.

[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:26, 2 January 2015 (UTC)
: You have good reasons for the choices you've made, but I have to admit that the whole Wauja project is technically in violation of our [[WT:CFI|Criteria for inclusion]]. This isn't, by itself, a fatal problem: the CFI are the result of community consensus, and can be modified by the community. So far, those of us who have been watching this unfold have simply held back on enforcing some of the rules, but someone of a perverse/contrarian disposition (we have a few) could request verification for any or all of the Wauja entries, and the admins would be forced to delete them.
: I think it may be time to bring this to the [[WT:BP|Beer parlour]] and make it official. It would probably also require a formal vote. I would guess the simplest route to take would be declaring that we would accept certain sources for verification even though they don't meet the requirements of our CFI. This might require some extra safeguards to avoid leaving us open to future fraud, as Kephir alluded to. It would also help to minimize the possibility of [[w:Wikipedia:Randy from Boise]]-type issues with people who know nothing about Wauja saying "if they can make edits not based on published sources, why can't I?" 
: The main obstacle I see is the "no original research" principle, which is one of the philosophical pillars of all Wikimedia projects. We allow more leeway in that respect due to the highly condensed and synthesized nature of dictionary entries, but we can't ignore it entirely.
: Even if we end up with the worst-case scenario of the Wauja project being rejected, the data would be retrievable for a while as part of the XML dumps, and the wikimedia software can be used by non-Wikimedia sites, so it might be possible to revive it somewhere else. I hope it doesn't come to that, though. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 23:57, 2 January 2015 (UTC)

:: Thank you, Chuck, for your very reasonable, thoughtful, and constructive comments. I agree with all of them, and was just about to ask you whether I could post my comments in the Beer Parlour. If I cut out the details, people may not fully understand why the current inclusion criteria, though perfectly reasonable for languages with a written tradition, effectively prevent languages that have an exclusively oral tradition (such as Wauja), from being included in any meaningful way. Let me know whether I should point to this page, or copy and paste my comments to the Beer Parlour.

:: Off the top of my head, I think we can set up general criteria that would avoid any "Randy from Boise" issues. For instance, in the absence of published materials written by native speakers, it seems reasonable for Wiktionary to ask for documentation supporting a certain percentage of entries, randomly chosen by an admin serving a quality control or auditing function. The contributor would comply by providing documentation for the entries under consideration. This could include original audio and video recordings in the endangered language, transcripts, digital manuscripts and communications. I have written up some additional ideas, but will sleep on it before posting them here tomorrow. Thanks again for your candid and very helpful comments.

Chuck, I'm thinking through the distinction between LDLs and Languages without a Written Tradition (which I'll call LWTs).  LWTs are a subset of LDLs. Many LDLs have an extensive written tradition, and can indeed be referenced with published sources. LWTs, on the other hand, by definition, do not have a written tradition and therefore do not have a body of publications authored by native speakers of that language. I think the current LDL criteria are probably appropriate for any LDL language with an establish written tradition. The issue is LWTs. Obviously, we cannot ask languages without publications to reference only publications. I am thinking through the issues and possible solutions and will post my suggestions in the next day or so. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 22:03, 3 January 2015 (UTC)

==Request to Add New Subcategory "LWT" Within LDL==
This is a request for the Wiktionary Community to consider adding a new subcategory, Languages without a Written Tradition (LWT), under LDL (Less Documented Languages).

===What is an "LWT"?===
An LWT is a language that has an oral tradition, but has no tradition of writing and no written publications authored by native speakers. LWTs are a subset of LDLs. (Note that documents authored in other languages by outsiders and merely translated by native speakers, such as the Bible and government documents, are not suitable as sources for documenting a language.)

===Why not Simply Call LWTs "Unwritten Languages"?===
The term "unwritten" can be misleading, because the boundary between languages that are "unwritten" and languages that are "written" is actually quite fuzzy.  Presumably we can all agree that a language community that has no writing system, no notion of literacy, and has never had its speech transcribed by outsiders can be considered an "unwritten language."

But when that community is visited by linguists who develop an orthography, and (perhaps imperfectly) transcribe some words and phrases from the spoken language into written form, perhaps publishing the results, what then? Is this language "written," even if no one in the language community is literate, and the published "results" contain the errors of a non-native speaker? Some of you might call such a language "written," and others just as reasonably might say it is "unwritten."

Let us now consider a third example. What about a small indigenous language community in Brazil that is completely unfamiliar with writing, and yet, through a process of increasing contact with the national society, develops an orthography and village schools, where children are taught to read and write in both their indigenous language and Portuguese? Obviously, when nearly every child can write words in their own language, the language cannot be considered an "unwritten language." Yet is it a "written" language?  Does it have great literature? Yes, in oral form. Poetry? Absolutely, in oral form. Historical narratives, sacred texts, genealogies, song lyrics, compendiums of botanical and zoological knowledge? Yes, all in oral form. What, then, is written in this language? Aside from basic word lists and literacy primers modeled on Portuguese examples, virtually nothing ‚Äî yet. Today's young adults are the first literate generation. 

This is the case with Wauja, an Arawak language spoken by 400 indigenous people in lowland Amazonia. Although Wauja was "unwritten" a generation ago, today it is "written," in the sense the children are taught basic literacy in their village schools. However, as yet ‚Äî and this doubtless will change ‚Äî there is no written tradition in this language, no body of publications authored by native speakers. All their literature is still in oral form.

For the purposes of Wiktionary, the key issue is not whether a missionary or professional linguist has phonetically transcribed snippets from the language, but whether there exists a body of work authored by native speakers that is large enough to provide references for every word in the language. For languages like English, Chinese, and all "major" languages, the answer is ''yes''.  These languages have extensive written traditions. For thousands of small and endangered languages, the answer is ''no''. These are languages with rich intellectual and literary traditions ‚Äî in oral form. Such languages may have some (recently-acquired) knowledge of writing, but they have no '''''tradition''''' of writing. This presence or lack of native-speaker-authored published references is the distinction that matters for the Wiktionary community, at least in reference to inclusion criteria.

===Why is the Subcategory LWT Needed?===
LWTs, by definition, lack a body of published sources authored by native speakers. As a result, it is not possible to use published sources to attest to Wiktionary entries for LWTs.  Nevertheless, LWTs are important members of the family of human languages, with rich literary and intellectual traditions, and they deserve to be included in Wiktionary.  In fact, these LWTs are typically endangered languages spoken by language communities that are most in need of the permanent, globally accessible, open source, cultural commons platform that '''''only''''' Wiktionary can provide. Therefore, it is proposed that the Wiktionary community define this limited category of languages (LWTs) and agree upon attestation criteria that are sensible and appropriate for such languages.

===Can LWTs Meet Current Attestation Standards?===
Current Wiktionary attestation standards call for verification either through widespread use (hard to verify for a language without publications) or "use in permanently recorded media, conveying meaning, in at least three independent instances spanning at least a year (different requirements apply for certain languages)." For spoken languages that are living [but not well documented on the Internet], only one use or mention is adequate, subject to the following requirements:

* the community of editors for that language should maintain a list of materials deemed appropriate as the only sources for entries based on a single mention,
* each entry should have its source(s) listed on the entry or citation page, and
* a box explaining that a low number of citations were used should be included on the entry page (such as by using the LDL template).

Assuming that the first bulleted requirement above refers to a list of materials that are permanently available online, probably most LWTs '''''cannot''''' meet this requirement. For example, in the case of the Wauja language, spoken as a first language by 400 people in the Amazonian rainforest, there are hundreds of audio recordings, and several dozen carefully transcribed traditional stories, but none of them currently are available online. (Though they could be made available to Wiktionary admins upon request.)

Before these stories are posted online, the community must agree that they are correctly transcribed. That's because they were first recorded and transcribed several decades ago by an anthropologist (myself, in this case), at a time before any Wauja were able to read and write.  Today, there is a cadre of young university-educated Wauja bilingual schoolteachers who are deeply committed to standardizing their orthography and documenting their language. However, this process takes time, because it is not decided by fiat.  Instead, the Wauja, like many communities that speak LWTs, take time to reach decisions through building consensus.  It's a chicken-and-egg situation.  Without a standard orthography, it's hard to build a dictionary, but without a dictionary, it's hard to standardize the orthography.

===Proposed Attestation Standards for LWTs===
To allow responsible documentation to proceed within Wiktionary while members of LWT communities increasingly move toward standard orthography, publications by native speakers, and full compliance with Wiktionary LDL attestation standards, the following interim attestation standards for LWTs are proposed:
* The community of editors for that language should maintain a list of materials deemed appropriate as the only currently existing sources for entries.
* These sources may include audio or video recordings of native speakers, and transcripts of such recordings.
* Sources also may include direct quotes from letters and written messages produced by literate native speakers, provided that the quoted material is archived online and annotated as described below.
* All sources must include mention of the date of the recording or transcription, names of the native speakers recorded, the location of the recording, the name of the person making the recording, and location where the source is archived, if not online.
* Once the transcript has been authorized by the language community as a faithful transcription, the names of community members involved in verifying the transcription also must be noted, and a copy must be posted to a permanent online location, such as Wikisource.
* If Wiktionary admins find any reason to doubt the authenticity of the sources cited, they shall be allowed to examine the source material.

The overall goal of attestation standards for LWTs is to ensure responsible and reliable attestation for LWT entries, while making Wiktionary the best platform for documenting the world's many LWTs.

===Honoring the "No Original Research" Principle===
For a language with a written tradition, it is appropriate to refer to published sources written in that language. However, for a language that consists of an exclusively oral tradition, it is appropriate to refer to authoritative oral sources that have been recorded and transcribed.  To ensure that the "no original research" principal is honored, transcriptions of traditional stories, historical narratives, public oratory, and sacred incantations performed by elders before an audience can be given priority as sources, since these linguistic sources are particularly authoritative and reliable for LWTs.

===Proposed Standard for Transitioning from LWTs to LDLs===
When a language has a sufficient body of publications (authored by native speakers) so that every word in the language can be referenced to a published work authored by native speakers, that language is no longer an LWT.

In practical terms, there is no hard and fast cut-off point, but perhaps we can say that once an LWT community has achieved a minimum threshold of 3,000 entries in Wiktionary, the community will have become aware of the importance of lexicography and its methods, and it will have benefited greatly from using Wiktionary to document, analyze, and teach literacy in their language. The language community will have had an opportunity to standardize their orthography, properly review transcriptions of older recordings of traditional oral literature, have native speakers produce new publications based on new recordings, and permanently archive online all such transcripts and publications. As a result, this language community will be considered capable of meeting LDL attestation standards going forward.

== "There are two words currently in the Wauja Wiktionary that I know to be incorrect" ==

Please post an explanatory note on the Talk pages for those two words, so that anybody working on Wauja in future will be alerted to the problem. Thanks! [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 22:56, 3 February 2015 (UTC)

: I would be glad to do so, but I don't think I have a recording of the first word, and given the issues regarding attestation, I want to be meticulous about that.  The second word would surely be in a recording of a sacred story that I am currently having converted from tape to digital format. In the meantime, I could ask one of the Wauja schoolteachers, who is a native speaker and a leader of the team who is developing a standard Wauja orthography, to write the word in an email, but Kephir has objected to my referencing email communications from native speakers, so I will avoid that unless I hear otherwise from the Wiktionary community. When I return to Brazil in September 2015, I can record the Wauja pronouncing the word and writing it on the blackboard of their village school, and use that as a source, if you think it would be accepted. At this time, I am adding only words that are recorded from orations by native speakers, transcribed, with the transcriptions verified by native speakers.

:::'''January 2017 update''': In 2016 I met with four native speakers of Wauja (Kupatopenu, Kuratu, Atapucha and Tukupe) and showed them several words that I found in the Wiktionary Wauja language site that I believed were incorrectly spelled. They all agreed that the following misspelled words need to be corrected: [[a'napi]], [[e'pi]], [[un…®]], [[kam√°]].  I am moving the four words and requesting that the old pages, confirmed by native speakers to be incorrect, be deleted. Explanation is below.
::::'''CORRECTION:''' When I tried to move '''''[[un…®]]''''' (incorrect) to '''[[uno]]''' (correct) and '''''[[kam√°]]''''' (incorrect) to '''[[kamo]]''' (correct), I discovered that I could not move them, because the target pages already existed (for other languages). I therefore simply copied the contents of the pages that were misspelled to the existing pages that used correct spelling. '''I am now requesting that the redundant pages using incorrect spelling (''[[un…®]]'' and ''[[kam√°]]'') be deleted.'''

:::* '''''[[a'napi]]''''' This word is currently incorrect and should be spelled '''anapi'''. Written Wauja does not use single quotes or apostrophes in any word.  The incorrect current version, [[a'napi]], appears to simply be the IPA phonetic transcription that was copied from elsewhere and pasted here. However, when written in Wauja, words are not marked for stress as they are in IPA. I am moving this page to '''anapi''', which 4 native speakers have confirmed to be the correct spelling, and requesting that [[a'napi]] be deleted.

:::* '''''[[e'pi]]''''' This word is currently incorrect and should be spelled '''epi'''. The current incorrect spelling ([[e'pi]]) appears to simply be the IPA phonetic transcription that was copied from elsewhere and pasted here.

:::* '''''[[un…®]]''''' This word is currently incorrect and should be spelled '''uno''', as the Wauja use "o" for the sound IPA describes as …®. They do NOT use "…®" in their orthography because it is incompatible with standard keyboards. Published source showing the correct spelling: See first line on p. 160, "Negation in Wauja discourse," by C. Ball, in ''Negation in Arawak Languages'', edited by Lev Michael, Tania Granadillo, Boston: Brill, 2014 https://books.google.com/books?id=FJMXAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=wauja+uno&source=bl&ots=Fm6RnKzvaS&sig=BRLoXaO4c7Tt9KZ_p11lFg39qNw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj26dr0-s_RAhVQ3yYKHRROB4YQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=wauja%20uno&f=false

After attempting to correct a typo in a page name I created a while back, I relaized it became a redirect. So I searched for advice given me (in 2014, by Chuck Entz) that I vaguely remembered. By the time I found it, some admin had already deleted the redirect page. Fast work! I wanted to thank the admin, but could not find his or her name, because I couldn't find the redirect page, as it had been deleted. So here's my Thank You. I assume the right admin will notice this message soon enough, as some of you seem to have near-telepathic powers!

== Leftovers from page moves ==

When you move a page, the old name is not deleted, but is kept as a redirect to the new name. For regular dictionary entries, this is usually undesirable, so could you add the {{temp|delete}} template to the old pages after you move them? ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:35, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

:Hi CodeCat!
:I apologize, when I didn't see the old page in my list of lemmas, I mistakenly thought it was gone. When I now search within search results, I see it still exists. I have added the delete template to four pages that I moved today. I have a few more corrections to make, based on input from native speakers who reviewed the Wiktionary entries in October 2016. Some of the corrections will address misspellings, and some are responding to the Wauja language community standardizing its official orthography to represent {{IPA|wau|/tj/}} as "x" instead of "ty". Using "x" to represent {{IPA|wau|/tj/}} was formerly an alternate spelling, but recently has been adopted as standard. The Wauja language was unwritten a generation ago, and so the community is still working out a standard orthography across all four villages. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 01:06, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

Also, the messages about errors that you've been leaving on talk pages are not really all that useful either, especially not once the erroneous page is deleted. Could you mark those talk pages for deletion as well? ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:46, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

:Certainly I will remove them and not leave messages there in the future. I wanted to clarify why I was requesting the deletion. Should I put that information on the new page in future? Thanks for your help. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 01:06, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

== Spelling change from "ty" to "x" ==
All the Wauja communities have now standardized on using "x" and not "ty" to spell the /tj/ sound. Therefore, I will modify certain Wauja words in the Wauja Wicktionary to conform with current Wauja orthographic standards. The Wauja are in the process of standardizing their orthography; we can expect that a small number of similar changes will be required in the future. '''[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]]''' ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 00:00, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
: I wonder why they chose that. It's a bit counterintuitive to me. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:06, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
:: Hi CodeCat!
:: SIL suggested it years ago. For some time, it was an alternate spelling. I personally preferred "ty" because the Wauja children also learn Portuguese, and the letter "x" in Portuguese '''''never''''' sounds like /tj/.  But the communities met and decided using "x" instead of "ty" was convenient and that it was OK for their language to have an "x" that sounded unlike any "x" in Portuguese. Compared to English spelling, however, Wauja is overall very regular and predictable. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 00:13, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
::: But if /tj/ is actually two phonemes, as you seem to indicate, then it would have been more in line with the one-letter-per-phoneme principle to write /tj/ with the letters for the phonemes /t/ and /j/. Now, instead, x stands for a sequence of two phonemes, much like it does in English (/ks/) which is not ideal IMO. Of course it's their choice, but I think I would have chosen differently! ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:54, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
:::: I agree. I hope I can convince them to rethink using the acute accent over vowels to mark vowel length, which is phonemic. Because although long vowels are usually in the stressed syllable, they aren't always. Stress can also be also phonemic, so it seems it should be marked when it is the only way to distinguish a minimal pair. If the Wauja use an acute accent to mark long vowels, however, everything gets muddy. When a long vowels is not stressed but is marked with an acute accent, it looks very confusing to see the accent on the "wrong" syllable. I know that some languages use acute accents to mark vowel length, but I think it creates problems in Wauja. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]])
::::: Another possibility would be using a circumflex for a long vowel. I believe that convention was used in the 19th century, though I don't remember what language- Old English, perhaps? [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 04:37, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
:::::: Thanks for that very practical suggestion. I'll discuss it with them.  It would be a good solution, because circumflex is available on all standard keyboards. All the young schoolteachers who are guiding the orthography discussions were trained in the Portuguese-language school system. Since Portuguese does not recognize long vowels, the young Wauja scholars must "unlearn" certain rules that don't apply to their language. All in good time. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 15:56, 14 February 2017 (UTC)

== When should I add the "delete" template? == 
I am moving a few words to reflect a decision by the Wauja to use the letter "x" in their orthography. Should I add the "delete" template to the old page '''''before''''' I move it, or go back and add it '''''after''''' I move it?  Because I'm afraid if I add it before, an admin might delete the old page before I move it.  On the other hand, I just moved a word and then immediately went back to add the "delete" template to the old page [[akaintya]], but couldn't find it.  Did I follow the correct procedure?  Thanks! '''[[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]]''' ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 00:21, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
: Move it, which turns the old name into a redirect to the new name. Then place {{temp|delete}} on the old name. Normally, when you go to a page that redirects to another, you'll immediately be sent to the new page, which is the purpose of redirects. But when you actually want to go to the old page, rather than being redirected by it, you can click the link just below the page title that says "redirected from (old page)". ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 00:52, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
:: Ah, thank you! I was doing it the hard way. [[User:Emi-Ireland|Emi-Ireland]] ([[User talk:Emi-Ireland|talk]]) 00:58, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
::: Something to note, though, is that Wiktionary allows entries for obsolete spellings. If the ty-spellings have actually been used, then there could still be an entry at the old name. It would be like any other entry, except that the definition would just be: {{temp|obsolete spelling of|(new page)|lang{{=}}wau}}. This is not required, but can be useful in case someone happens to read a text written in the old spelling. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 01:18, 14 February 2017 (UTC)
:::: Thank you for drawing that to my attention. At this time, there are no texts printed in Wauja that I am aware of. There will be this year, though, and I expect that the orthography will continue to change a little bit after that. So this is good to know.

:: Its a rather convoluted debate so I will just outline some facts to consider: 
:::* The earliest concrete references in Greek to the bird are found post-Persian conflict; Aristotle calls it a 'Persian Bird', Aristophanes uses them also despairingly as symbols of gaudy-dressed ambassadors, a jab perhaps also at the colorful foreign Persians.
::::* {{m|grc|œÑ·æ∞œéŒΩ}}, another word being glossed as 'peacock' was used prior, appearing even in Homer and Hesiod mean something like fair-dressed, beautifully adorned, birds in a general way for their colorful feathers, not inherently referring to a peacock. This gives it a potential to possibly not be a foreign loan, but rather derived from a precursor word that was then reapplied to a peacock in later times. ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/wordfreq?lang=greek&lookup=taw%2Fs])
:::* The Akkadian attestation of peacock is {{m|akk|íÄ≠íÑ©íâåíÑ∑|tr=[[w:Haya_(god)|Ha-ia]]}}, suggested to be named after the sound it makes, connected and written as the god linked to guarding the storehouses, keeping food supplies, perhaps the 'eyes' of its plumage linking it to a 'watcher' like in the Greek mythology. There is however a loanword from Sumerian {{m|sux|íÄâíçóíçëíÑ∑|tr=ti-u≈°, tius, tiuz|t=a bird}} {[http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/nepsd-frame.html]}, the general conception seems to be sudden in appearance, initially unseen, to swoop or come out of seemingly nowhere, to come upon quickly, to rush or dart, hence the speculated identity of an eagle or vulture. Perhaps instead a reference to the peacocks sudden opening of its plumage, being dazzling or darting up.
::::* There is a Semitic root likely derived from the Sumerian loan found in the Hebrew and Aramaic verb {{m|he|◊ò◊ï÷º◊©◊Ç|tr=·π≠us, ·π≠≈´s|t=to fly, to rush, to dart, to swoop}} {[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/2907.htm][http://cal.huc.edu/oneentry.php?lemma=%2Bws%20V&cits=all]} and in the Arabic {{ar-root|ÿ∑|ÿ≥|ÿ≥}} meaning to strike suddenly, to smite, to be struck blind, to be blinded or to lose ones ability to think; hence the connection again to being dazzled; likewise Lane and others like J.G. Hava mention {{ar-root|ÿ∑|ÿ¥|ÿ¥}} having the meaning of weakness in sight, to be faint.
::Needless to say its very interesting and without definitive direction; the Greek could have borrowed the term from Akkadian through the Persian cultural bridging or perhaps from earlier borrowed constellation traditions; there however is a missing Persian term that would ease the mystery. 
::Additionally, it should be stated the whole connection {{m|ta|‡Æ§‡Øã‡Æï‡Øà||plumage, peacock}} is actually for another Hebrew term {{m|he|◊™◊ï◊õ◊ô|tr=t√∫ki|t=parrot, peacock}} which developed semantically later from commentaries on verse 1 Kings 10:22 ([http://biblehub.com/lexicon/1_kings/10-22.htm]}; the reconstructed meaning found in many modern translation is that of baboon or monkey. --[[User:Profes.I.|Profes.I.]] ([[User talk:Profes.I.|talk]])

You inserted {{temp|taxlink}} in this entry, for which I thank you. 

However, you did not insert the rank of the taxonomic name, "species" in this case. If you are going to verify the entry, please insert the rank.

Within {{temp|taxlink}} you inserted "ver=180716". In this case I'd rather you hadn't. I check each new taxonomic name to see that whether is spelled correctly, whether there is a taxonomic name that supersedes it, and whether the rank of the name is correct. I don't expect others to do all that, as it can be time-consuming and has some idiosyncracies. OTOH, if you find that there is a Wikispecies entry for the taxon or that the Wikipedia article uses the taxonomic name, feel free to insert "ver=YYMMDD".

== Translingual ==

[[WT:AMUL]] indicates that it doesn't include grammatical terms (which can have all kinds of lexical information). <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  14:27, 13 September 2018 (UTC)

:{{ping|Lingo Bingo Dingo}} I have read it and it does not indicate it, the term ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù does not occur in it. Grammatical terms are undertreated and underdiscussed here. I don‚Äôt know those ‚Äúall kinds of lexical information‚Äù. There is only the pronunciations which are intentionally left out however according to [[WT:AMUL]]¬†since it ‚Äúvaries by language‚Äù and would regularly be fabricated anyway. Your Dutch entry {{m|nl|genitive absolute}}¬†does not contain any lexical information that could not be in Translingual. It has endings like a Latin word and can be pronounced like Latin. {{m|nl|absolute genitief}} and {{m|de|absoluter Genitiv}} are language-specific, {{m|mul|genitivus absolutus}} is not, including in Latin it is Translingual, and still translingual when it is written ‚ÄúGenitivus absolutus‚Äù capitalized in German texts. We don‚Äôt add terms like {{m|mul|Genitivus}}, {{m|mul|Ablativus}} by the way though we add {{m|de|Genitiv}}, {{m|de|Ablativ}}. So what with ‚Äúgenitivus absolutus‚Äù that I find in Russian texts? Does it now mean Russian words have Latin script? ({{ping|Atitarev}}) It‚Äôs just taxonomic Latin, translingual grammar terms, technical Latin to classify the grammars of the world, and it seems that you should convert {{m+|nl|genitivus absolutus}} to Translingual. How do you distinguish code-switching from Dutch if you claim it is Dutch? There is taxonomical¬†''{{m|mul|Moringa}}'' and an English {{m|en|moringa}}¬†apparently borrowed from the Translingual, and I know it is English not only from the spelling but it is in wide use by people speaking English who know no science. But the grammatical terms: Those are specialist, used by people who habitually switch to Latin, even if they do not understand the Latin language in general as it is not rarely the case for taxonomists today. How do we even call it when a word permeates the barrier from Translingual to English/Dutch/German/Russian? Naively we use {{temp|bor}} but this process is not ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù as the term is generally understood in linguistics, the physical processes that happen there are dissimilar. Grammar Latin is not prescribed to use italics like biological Taxonomical Latin so this is a dark spot in lexicography. People never cared if a term is code-switching to Latin, Translingual, or native, when they used the grammar terms and lexicographers had economical reasons to leave them out, but now we have all room we eventually have to care. I the terms were more we would need at Wikigrammar in addition to Wikispecies. By the way not few English terms of grammar have become Translingual because they lack in other languages, i.‚ÄØe. the English terms are used in linguistics literature and I would not always know if it is code-switching to English or use of Translingual. With a greater collection of such terms I could ask the community if this grammar taxonomy is the same as biological taxonomy; it will stay a wee bit more difficult to sort out however; I can‚Äôt remember classification guides for grammar like biologists have them for such terms, those terms are scattered. {{ping|DCDuring|Atitarev}} [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 16:09, 13 September 2018 (UTC)
::Translingual is a fraught topic, but we have historically not treated such entries as Translingual, and I think it would a mistake to do so. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 17:08, 13 September 2018 (UTC)
:::I've wondered about whether medical and legal Latin terms shouldn't be deemed Translingual as they are included in running text in many languages. No one was interested and some were opposed, so the notion went nowhere. I would expect similar lack of interest for linguistic terms. Chemical and biological taxonomic names have international regulatory bodies whose existence is a testimony to their importance and translingual use. There may be a case for other classes of scientific vocabulary to be called Translingual, eg, geological names, mineral names, astronomical names, but I detect no potential for a consensus to treat such terms as Translingual. I'm not sure that there is any particular advantage to users in calling such terms (or even chemical and taxonomic names) Translingual. MW3 famously labelled many such terms "ISV", for "International Scientific Vocabulary". [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 17:49, 13 September 2018 (UTC)
:::Historically (fifteen years ‚Ä¶), there were many things to do first; grammar terms, like biology taxonomy, are just one of the peripheral things linguists don‚Äôt care about because they are sufficiently busy with the natural languages. Sure, sure, I agree that we all lack interest ‚Äì I have too enough natural language things to do, but as I said, but sooner or later we will no longer be able to ignore the incertitude. To think for the future, now one would like to define certain terms of grammar but I don‚Äôt feel like they belong to any language and I don‚Äôt think users expect us to distinguish; nobody cares if such a term is attested in Slovenian or not, or if he does he would like to see it as a citation for Translingual. It‚Äôs about having {{m|mul|termini technici}} so users who find them can put them into a Wiktionary search and get them defined. If he then reads: ‚ÄúDutch ‚Äì Portuguese ‚Äì Serbo-Croatian‚Äù I think he will turn up his nose. Such terms are regularly even coined with the intention of being used translingually in the literatures of each national science, and ''intended to be the same in every language''. And yes, it is also about maintainability. Now {{ping|Lingo Bingo Dingo}} has created a term for Dutch that, in my view, clearly falls into that ''International Scientific Vocabulary'' category and I can only recommend him to change his view over time lest a monster grow out of such a practice (I can‚Äôt be bothered about the presence of this specific term as Dutch here too much, I am just voicing a general cause of unease). [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 18:03, 13 September 2018 (UTC)
:::: My reason for creating language-specific entries for such terms is that separate entries for are the ideal location for information about pronunciation, inflection and semantic relations (e.g. native synonyms or nativised spellings). Allowing e.g. {{m|nl|absolute genitief}} but not {{m|nl|genitivus absolutus}} would create a strange lacuna for what seems to be the more common synonym. <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  06:52, 14 September 2018 (UTC)
::::: That‚Äôs all things you could say about biological taxons (though they don‚Äôt inflect often; being inflected however does not necessarily estrange the quality of being translingual ‚Äì I see though translingual medical terms (terms that physicians use in their talk) that get inflected for number). Also no lacuna if a term is present as Translingual. It sounds like you fear adding entries as translingual. The synonyms part could be solved with translation sections but languages do not seem to tend to have translations for such terms (as you have seen yourself the nativized term being uncommon in Dutch, same in German). So what‚Äôs with the pronunciation? Latin teachers say {{m|mul|ablativus absolutus}}¬†either in Barbaric pronunciation or in one a Roman would have used (it‚Äôs like with the biological taxonomy). It‚Äôs typical if languages get switched, like if one first speaks Russian and then German often the German will at first sound like Russian, or when people in Germany speak Russian and throw in German words they are pronounced either as Russian or as German. No lacuna if I don‚Äôt add all the German words Russians use in their speech here. German words being pronounced with Russian phonology and in Russian sentences does not fool me into believing they are Russian. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 08:04, 14 September 2018 (UTC)
:::::: There would still be the issue of presenting gender for various languages with different gender systems. And taxonomic names rarely inflect, both for species and genera. A problem with presenting pronunciations in a Translingual section is that it prevents the entry from displaying detailed variation particular to a language, see the two possible ways of stressing {{m|nl|genitivus absolutus}} for an example. This is notable because one is the default stress pattern for a Dutch adjective + noun phrase while the other indicates that ''genitivus'' is the head of the phrase. <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  10:39, 17 September 2018 (UTC)
::::::: The varying stress is the typical ‚Äùdo it as in your native tongue‚Äù of Translingual Latin terms; when one incorpates words in an other language in a sentence they will usually have a peculiar pronunciation at least to fit into the whole intonation of the sentence the specific language calls for, as I have exemplified by those German words appearing in Russian speech; still not different from the biological taxonomy (back in the dark ages people did not know a ‚ÄúTranslingual‚Äù i.e. for example reconstructed classical way to pronounce Latin). And who said Translingual terms do not have gender? It looks to me like they do have a gender if the language they are used in needs one (there is some language-specific formatting behaviour for Translingual terms, like German capitalization sometimes applies to such terms (usage varies)). And the grammatical terms surely just inherit the Latin gender even strong against language-specific habits. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 11:09, 17 September 2018 (UTC)
:::::::: Call me crazy, but I think it is the task of a dictionary to indicate when common variations in pronunciation exist. Details like gender and other distinctions should be demonstrated, not assumed on the basis of (generally reliable) rules of thumb.
:::::::: Look, I have no particular problem with a Translingual entry in addition to entries from borrowing languages (though it seems not very useful to me, and Translingual in mostly European languages looks like a very parochial form of Tranlingual to me), my problem is with a Translingual entry replacing them. But maybe you should first demonstrate that this form is used in a great many languages. So far I have only seen this spelling being common in English, Dutch and German (with different capitalisation). <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  10:14, 19 September 2018 (UTC)

:{{ping|Rua}} No I don‚Äôt. But the original name could easily be a redirect. Titles of templates are a different story (they are not visible in the created page).
:I ping here {{ping|Vahagn Petrosyan}} because he spread those transliterated names. I know where those transliterations come from. Library catalogues. Surely this is an argument, that‚Äôs why I have kept transliterations of the titles (while not the author names because it would be ugly to have Surname (translit), forename (translit), only in the format Forename Surname (translit translit) it would be acceptable). But I underline here that transliteration of author names of book titles ''does not'' let your works appear more scientific or something like that. Librarians yore had to add foreign-script books to their index cards and computers, they could not enter Cyrillic even when they perfectly the language, and not every printer could print non-Latin scripts. Transliteration became imitated and a habit, one would be more safe to do transliterations ‚Äúbecause it has always been done like this‚Äù and one does not need to explain to the publisher then that one needs such things (foreign scripts = copyeditor costs). But this all is misplaced on the internet or in the 21th century, and in library catalogues they should put the original script everywhere. A digital native just searches the original script, in a library catalogue or if he searches Wiktionary, it is unsensible why one should try various transliterations to find a book. And in Wiktionary we use original script almost on every occasion. Now it‚Äôs strange we use the pagename to fill {{para|entry}} but use transliterations in the rest of the reference template, and also as I have showed {{m|ru|—Å—Ç–∞–∫–∞–Ω}} has lines of Persian script anyway. Naively, I created {{temp|R:rup:Polenakoviƒá}} in the original script, Latin template name but else all original. And I am even in Germany. Even stranger it must be for Russians coming here to find bibliographic references transliterated. See also [[:Category:Japanese reference templates]], of course the templates just use Japanese script and creators did not even think to transliterate. In the non-Latin-writing countries one obviously has the original scripts in the library catalogues. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 14:12, 11 November 2018 (UTC)

::::: To me the ideal would have both the original title and the transliteration, with a preference for the former if only one or the other is included, so as to be able to easily look up the original work.

You can‚Äôt read Armenian script and can‚Äôt read Armenian (or is this a rare case when one is just illiterate in one script but does understand the spoken language?). And if this were an argument it would still not do away with the arguments for the original script, which would lead us to having all of main script, transliteration and translation, but then rightly {{ping|Dan Polansky}} dissents that this is too much clutter.

:::: Oh I assume I know what‚Äôs the matter. You just hate Cyrillic. Like elsewhere claiming that {{diff|49332014||writing Yaghnobi in Cyrillic is nationalist propaganda}}. You should repent your passions and undo your deviations from the standard, either by main-script and translation (recommended) or main-script, transliteration and translation (which I would agree with, since my main issue is that you can‚Äôt find the templates in the original script without it and ''you force people to read transliterations''). Or what am I supposed to do now? Write a vote to stretch [[WT:EL]] to an even longer proportion? I chose the most natural option, but if you want the references format dictated after this not having been felt required yet it can also be arranged.
:::: I don‚Äôt like any of the alphabets more. But if one knows Russian one reads Russian in Russian and not in transliteration and one does not recognize the references when they are written in transliteration (one recognizes words by their written form) and one does not find them when one wants to find if a template is already in Wiktionary (potentially also leading to duplicate templates), unless one actually searches templates by insource-search.

::::: In my case, I may well have heard of the author by name, and will recognize the name if it's written in Latin script, but not in a script I can't read, like Armenian or Japanese. If I see the name in Latin script, and a translation of the book title in English, I know whether it's an interesting book, and if so, I will go see if there's a translation in English or some other language I can read, or if not and I'm interested only in a specific entry, I will consider bugging someone (e.g. [[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] for Armenian) to help translate that entry. If the name is in an unreadable script, then none of this is possible. Note that I actually prefer to see foreign names transliterated using "conventional" instead of scientific transliteration, hence e.g. Tchaikovsky not ƒåajkovskij, but I lost the debate on this one ... you win some debates, you lose others, and you move on.

:::::: {{ping|Benwing2}} ‚ÄúI may well have heard of the author by name‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs an argument. I know another one: It is dubious how to alphabetize references if they are in multiple scripts, but computers always take the Latin first, then the Cyrillic, then the Arabic etc., i.‚ÄØe. go by Unicode. ''But'' that the title is translitered (not translated, that‚Äôs not my issue) does not make you know whether it‚Äôs interesting, that‚Äôs a difference here!

However that‚Äôs not even that important or severe, that is to say, since these serve only as names and do not convey anything, I expect names there anyhow. But: Having the book-titles in transliterations ''only'' is a very grave affront. I thought I could avoid reading Russian language (the names are marginal, I mean Russian text) in transliteration. Everyone in the main Cyrillic-writing countries ''avoids reading transliterations of his language.'' I have not yet seen an argument why the ''book titles'' of Russian need to be transliterated (I wanted to appease the overloaded mind) or even ''the original form not given''. Why so? (Plus I think you overestimate the existence of English translations of references here. And if the name is in an unreadable script, nothing becomes impossible. You can copy and past ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs better and the original title identifies the work.)
:::::: Also, what‚Äôs up with the [[:Category:Japanese reference templates|Japanese reference templates]]?

{{ping|Vahagn Petrosyan}}¬†Having Georgian names though Georgian does not employ majuscules transcribed in bibliographies with minuscules, as by {{temp|R:ccs:Kiria}}, looks ugly as hell. Georgians themselves would transcribe their names with majuscules, and Arabic names are also never given in minuscules. One just expects names in Latin script to have majuscules, that‚Äôs what the distinction is for: everybody knows that the original script has not employed the distinction and it is introduced since it has none in the script ‚Äì it is like our Latin editions rightly use punctuation and minuscules that the Romans didn‚Äôt. If the original Georgian script would come first the issue would be less irking; but even if it does not that is all too strange. And still, the fact that one has to reverse-transcribe into Georgian or Russian or whatever to find the book is annoying. Do you know understand my argument here from the difference between print and web, {{ping|Victar}}? Like you have seen on [[Wiktionary:Votes/2019-05/Lemmatizing Akkadian words in their transliteration]] that in print practices are kept which are rather to be avoided I recognized that bibliographies should be had in the original script. (Another thing it is of course if Vahagn can read the script but not write it well on the computer, but then I have explained why one should not be reverted if somebody adds it. It would be like removing the cuneiform from Akkadian entries under whatever title Tom 144 has planned them to be.)

Hi can you check out {{ar-root|ÿ¥|ÿπ|ŸÑ}}? It's probably my first Arabic edit so I want to make sure I did a good job. The page was in a state that broke a simple parser I was writing so I decided to fix it up.

: Seems right. {{ping|Polypz}}. <small>There is probably more to be added from Classical Arabic dictionaries ({{temp|R:ar:Lane}}, {{temp|R:ar:Freytag}}, {{temp|R:ar:Kazimirski}}, {{temp|R:ar:Dozy}} I use, or the medieval originals at [http://lisaan.net/ Lisaan.net]), but what there is looks good.</small> For the third printing of the Hans Wehr dictionary, there has been a template once, then later the fourth printing template came, then I replaced all instances of the third printing template for the newer because you know, one is supposed to cite the newest ones, and that template camped on the name¬†{{temp|R:ar:Wehr}}. If you want to cite the third edition you can copy the {{temp|R:ar:Wehr-4}} or {{temp|R:ar:Wehr-5-de}}¬†with the necessary data changes under the name {{temp|R:ar:Wehr-3}} (unless you mean the German third printing, then it is {{temp|R:ar:Wehr-3-de}}). It would now make sense to have such a template because in the meantime the publisher made the third printing available on [https://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/inhouse/content/titleinfo/4845662?query=Hans%20Wehr MENAdoc] and one can make it so the template links the pages numbers, if they are given.

:::I did look into Wehr-4, otherwise I could not have written the page numbers. No, there weren‚Äôt page numbers in the citations.

Like verb form I and verb form II and verbal noun of verb form I under three etymologies, and under each Wehr and {{temp|R:ar:Steingass}}. Now the recommendation is to write the page numbers so we get the links, including books not digitized or linked yet (for even if one book is now not directly accessible, in hundred years it will be, or when there is a revolution that abolishes copyright, etc.; I imagine Wiktionary for Arabic like the [http://cal.huc.edu/ CAL] for Aramaic), and don‚Äôt ‚Äúspread‚Äù the templates of simple dictionaries all around (right, in the spreading-butter sense): If you have a root entry, you regularly don‚Äôt need the templates on each page belongining to this root. People seems to forget that we still do not ‚Äúattest‚Äù senses by referring to dictionaries, these templates are supposed to be a service to the reader, and the editors have to be wary how much clutter the reader can bear. For this use of the templates it isn‚Äôt more ‚Äúscientific‚Äù either if you cite the dictionaries you have consulted at every page creation, for using the templates doesn‚Äôt say state that your content is from there (which isn‚Äôt even supposed to be, you know, Wiktionary is a [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary_for_Wikipedians#How_we_provide_references_and_citations|secondary source]]), and in fact you can make more errors because you lose focus by the presence of this boilerplate. {{ping|Polypz}} [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 08:58, 17 March 2019 (UTC)

== Did the script become larger? ==

Dear [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]], is it my browser, is it my idea, or is it true: Did the arabic lemmata get bigger letters at their headword? If yes, I am so glad!.

:No, they didn‚Äôt, not for me, though there have been font changes on 3rd April 2019. To change on el.Wiktionary, I think you have to change [[el:MediaWiki:Common.css]]. In en.Wiktionary [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] it is the lines: {{code|css|‚Äú.Arab,<br>

== Turkish as transliteration ==

Why are you putting links to Turkish entries as transliterations for Ottoman Turkish terms? We treat them as two different languages. [[User:Ultimateria|Ultimateria]] ([[User talk:Ultimateria|talk]]) 20:04, 6 June 2019 (UTC)
: Because the Ottoman Turkish entries will stay redlinks for long. We treat them as different languages but the Modern Turkish entries do the service as substitutes. Compare [[w:Wikipedia:Dead-end pages]]. And your rule-based argument does not work, for from the general treatment as different languages you cannot infer that we cannot do that.

:I could of course just write ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ|tr=kabak}} ({{cog|tr|kabak}})‚Äù but isn‚Äôt it smoother to read ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ|tr={{m|tr|kabak}}}}‚Äù? The Modern Turkish spelling will almost always be the same as the transcription of the Ottoman, and I want to avoid repetition; particularly since our etymologies frequently have readability issues by much material. This of course demands that you have found out that for Ottoman links the transcriptions may be links. But there may be language specific linking practices, like for Serbo-Croatian. So what? You want to change all such links to ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ|tr=kabak}} ({{cog|tr|kabak}})‚Äù? Well have fun with those. As I have felt it, it is easier to write and to read ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ|tr={{m|tr|kabak}}}}‚Äù. Another formed would be ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|-}}¬†{{m|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ}} / {{m|tr|kabak}}‚Äù or something with a different sign like ‚Äú{{m|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ}} ‚Äì {{m|tr|kabak}}‚Äù but this is tedious to write and to read in the source code.

::::I don't exactly have an "argument", because, as you said, I only asked. It's unfortunate that the Ottoman Turkish lemmas will be redlinks for a long time, but that shouldn't be a factor in deciding how to format. Does a Macedonian term derived from Ottoman Turkish need to link to the modern Turkish term at all? For a parallel, look at links to modern French terms in etymologies for English terms derived from Middle French. I don't think it's necessary, but maybe that's just me.

::::: Any "solution" that has you adding templates inside a template parameters is a bad one. I also agree again with Ultimateria that redlinks shouldn't be a factor in formatting, and why does the modern Turkish need mentioning anyhow?

:::::: How do you derive that rule that adding templates inside template parameters is bad? There are a lot of cases of templats inside templates, for example the tables. The redlink isn‚Äôt a factor in formatting, it is a factor why the modern Turkish needs mentioning, or rather linking ‚Äì in such a smart way it is not even ‚Äúmentioned‚Äù but linked anyway. You give me yourself the reason why I use the format: So we don‚Äôt mention the Modern Turkish because people feel ‚Äúit is not needed‚Äù.

Others boo me out for using the word ‚Äúwhence‚Äù (it happened really, I don‚Äôt mention who unless you ask). There are a lot of other formats, one can just list the terms, if it is a cognates list, or one uses an arrow ‚Äú‚Üí‚Äù, or one does what I have done for Ottoman. Formerly the ''U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN'' ‚Äú>‚Äù has been often used for these purposes. {{ping|Dan Polansky}} has removed it half a decade ago with AutoWikiBrowser for being ambiguous or bad typography. But I assume the format ‚Äú{{bor|mk|ota|ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÇ|tr={{m|tr|kabak}}}}‚Äù is the one he finds most preferable for being minimalistic.

:You can‚Äôt rely on any dictionary in this case. You‚Äôd need to decide on the meaning if a passive participle likely exists. Or you can search the web. Because Hans Wehr in general does not list participles: it often only does if they are somehow independently lexicalized, not merely a form that can occur. Probably you are right that {{m|ar|ÿ£ŸéÿØŸèÿ®Ÿé‚Äé}} has no passive participle, because passive use is rare for base stem verbs with perfect vowel /u/ and one would use {{m|ar|ŸÖŸèÿ§ŸéÿØŸéŸëÿ®}} from the IInd stem anyway.¬†[[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 18:26, 30 July 2019 (UTC)

:It‚Äôs good if you think that.
:<span style="color:#789922;">>Is there a possibility of copyright infringement from copying the Hans Wehr definitions more or less verbatim?</span>
:Yes. It would require that they reach the {{w|threshold of originality}}. Of course for a given word there is only a limited amount of correct glosses: people would often gloss the same way without using this dictionary, which is how you can see that the content is not original. The threshold of originality is higher in Germany, but the general advice is that you should try to use at least ''some'' own words in general, or if it is not obvious that the threshold of originality is not reached (I know no jurisprudence in relation to dictionaries), so it is less likely to be a copy and more likely to be an [https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/24.html independent work] or it is at least processually difficult to claim that this is copied: if you use own words then in court you would claim that the entry from the dictionary alleged by the claimant to be copied wasn‚Äôt even original, as proven by your coming up with a similar wording and hardly much other wording being possible.
:<span style="color:#789922;">>I'm not sure if there is a standard form for the preposition notations, e.g. in the root page Form V "to let oneself be guided</span>
:There isn‚Äôt. I often use {{temp|+preo}}¬†and {{temp|+obj}}¬†in the word pages (and they are allegedly still beta) but omit them in the root entry. Sometimes I have put something like {{temp|lb|with|_|{{l|ar|PREPOSITION|tr=-}}}}¬†in front of a gloss on a word page.
:<span style="color:#789922;">>The etymology for {{m|ar|ÿ£ÿØÿ®}} claims a Persian origin but I can't find a reference for this, and I don't know how to put etymologies in roots (there is no root listed for {{m|ar|ÿ≥Ÿéÿ¨ŸéŸëŸÑŸé}} which I could have used as an example).</span>
:It‚Äôs well known to be Persian even to an averagely educated Arab in the Middle Ages, and you can see that the meanings in the root are kinda ‚Äúdenominal‚Äù from the one noun {{m|ar|ÿ£ŸéÿØŸéÿ®}}¬†that got borrowed in old times; at other words you will see that apart from one word the other words are rare derivations, as with {{m|ar|ÿ®ŸéÿµŸíŸÖŸéÿ©}} (about which in a survey the highest share of Arabs answered that this word is native Arabic, 215 against 26 that this is Arabic, while it is a Turkish borrowing: see the 2009 paper [http://kaynakca.hacettepe.edu.tr/eser/28036095/ottoman-lexical-obsolescence-in-the-arabic-dialects-of-the-galilee-region Ottoman Lexical Obsolescence ƒ∞n The Arabic Dialects Of The Galilee Region] for how the common impression is fooled). But you don‚Äôt need to know this, and references are especially hard to find for Semitic languages. But I see etymologies are probably not your focus anyway, you just want have the words and their meanings, otherwise you would drift away: and luckily I have added the bulk of Aramaic derivations already, and many Persian etymologies are either already included or not often encountered, while Ottoman words rarely belong to the literary language you delve in, not to mention other Turkic words like {{m|ar|ÿÆŸèÿßÿ≤ŸèŸàŸÇ}}¬†which are absolute exceptions. Statistics currently: [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Aramaic]]: 316, +173 [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Classical Syriac|from Classical Syriac]] makes 489, while [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Persian]] has 187, +22 of [[Category:Arabic terms derived from Iranian languages|indeterminate Iranian origin]], and [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Ottoman Turkish|Ottoman]] gets merely 67. The Aramaic borrowings have been specifically tracked down by me for all kinds of obscure words to get the number to 500, while the Persian borrowings surely can be doubled by specifically searching for Persian borrowings in sources across ages but as I said the frequency of the words yet to be added is so that you will rarely be bothered by any new ones anyway. Modern borrowings from European languages you hardly can fail to recognize. What is left is Greek, we count right now 242 from [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek]] + 8 from [[:Category:Arabic terms derived from Greek|Modern Greek]], giving a round 250, and there is theoretically much more to add because of the science {{w|translation movement}}, but these are also often extinct and only listed in specialist works (like [https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/W%C3%B6rterbuch_zu_den_griechisch-arabischen_%C3%9Cbersetzungen_des_9._Jahrhunderts/titel_2572.ahtml W√∂rterbuch zu den griechisch-arabischen √úbersetzungen des 9. Jahrhunderts from 2002]). So you see just by the statistics that etymology is not to be feared by you. The number of foreign words already uncovered is disproportionate to the number of perfectly Arabic entries yet to be created, extremely high with about 10‚ÄØ% of the [[:Category:Arabic lemmas|Arabic lemmas]], unlike with the Persian language where it seems that the {{cog|sem|-}} words alone make up 60% of the actual vocabulary.

== [[ribizli]] ==

Hi, the changes I made were based on an online etymology dictionary provided in the Resources section. It's in Hungarian, but even if you don't know Hungarian you can still see the spellings. If there is a resource you can provide for your version, please add it. You're right that Arabic is not the ultimate source. [[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 18:34, 9 August 2019 (UTC)
:{{ping|Panda10}} I know what you base your etymologies on. You like to follow the sources word by word, but still languages names found in certain sources need to be translated into the [[Wiktionary:List of languages|languages]] of Wiktionary and you have to understand what the names of languages mean. The distinction is so minutes that it isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúversions‚Äù. If you look a bit at the stemmata on Wikipedia (which are correct), you see that {{w|Upper German}} is divided in Alemannic, Bavarian, and High Franconian. German as spoken in Austria belongs to {{w|Bavarian language|Bavarian}}. So what your sources call Bavarian may well not mean anything other than Austrian German. One might of course distinguish Standard Language from dialectal language, but such a distinction is moot. While there is and was diglossia in Austria and Bavaria, it is a moot question whether a plant name derives ‚Äúfrom dialect‚Äù or ‚Äúfrom the standard language‚Äù; it is regularly a false dilemma if one wants to say that a plant name belongs to the dialects or to ‚Äúthe standard language‚Äù. One can only tell if a plant name is local: sometimes the dialect exhibits a dialect-specific shape not acceptable in the written language, but that is not the case here: as you see from the IPA in {{m|de|Ribisel}}, it is pronounced ''identical'' to the ‚ÄúBavarian‚Äù {{m|de|ribisl}} sometimes found in dialect dictionares. In particular however when I created {{m|de|Ribisel}} I searched the uses of the word, and it seems really restricted to Austria and Bavaria close to Austria, aside from German as spoken in what is today Czechia. Consequentially one reads also on many places that {{cog|hu|ribizli}}¬†is borrowed from the Austrian {{m|de|Ribisel}}, or [https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&id=ZzghAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Ribizl this book] seems to prefer ''Bohemian'' origin. But why all this? Because it is really the same language. The form that underlied the Hungarian is a German [ÀàriÀêbiÀêzlÃ©]: It‚Äôs not a version, as I said. For me from a German perspective the further statements ‚Äúit is ‚ÄúBavarian‚Äù or ‚Äúit is Austrian German‚Äù and ‚Äúit is Bohemian German‚Äù are not distinct. Do you remember {{w|Austria-Hungary}}? All of Czechia and Austria were together with Hungary and reinforced the borrowing at least if it was borrowed before (since which century is the Hungarian attested? this is a more interesting question), but were at least ''always'' more close to Hungary than Bavaria. Technically the standard German {{m|de|Ribisel}}¬†is the {{w|Dachsprache}}¬†for the Bavarian, but since the word is only regionally used in the language area of the Bavarian dialects (comprising Austria and areas of Bohemia like Bavaria) it does not give any more information if you say ‚Äúit is from Bavarian‚Äù, unless you want to say that it is borrowed from low registers of people who did not even know Standard German, which is a very dubious and unprovable claim, and it gives even less since you choose to link {{m|bar|ribisl}} that won‚Äôt be created, as most other dialectal entries of German, instead of the existing entry {{m|de|Ribisel}} which serves the same purpose.
:Long talk ‚Äì said in short: Do you even know what difference it makes to say from ‚ÄúBavarian German‚Äù and ‚Äúfrom Bavarian‚Äù? Not every distinction that appears in the designations of languages is actually there.
:Tell us better about when and where the Hungarian word is attested first. If one doesn‚Äôt know such details of its spread then it isn‚Äôt justified either to make such oddly specific claims like ‚Äúfrom Bavarian registers of people who did not even know Standard German‚Äù. Then ‚Äì and this what I assume, and you can see by comparing the various books ‚Äì the decision of whether the term is borrowed ‚Äúfrom Bavarian‚Äù, from ‚ÄúAustrian‚Äù, ‚Äúfrom Bohemian‚Äù is arbitrary. You can also just say ‚Äúfrom German‚Äù. However as I have said the label ‚ÄúAustrian‚Äù seems to be appropriate (which I employ for words I know to be of basically merely Austrian usage, like {{m|de|Esszeug}}). If you just follow some books ‚Äúblindly‚Äù you of course do not realize how arbitrary claims of the linguists often are. Like here, where {{cog|bar|ribisl}} and {{cog|AG.|Ribisel}} aren‚Äôt a different thing, which you might not realize if you haven‚Äôt heard German much. There are several such problematic claims, for example the Bavarian form of {{m|de|T√§schel}} {{m|hu|tarsoly}}¬†derives from would not be different from any ‚Äústandard‚Äù form, and {{m|hu|krumpli}} is also problematic, in that ‚Äústandard‚Äù {{m|de|Grundbirne}} and ‚ÄúBavarian‚Äù {{m|bar|grumper}}, {{m|bar|krumbeer}}, {{m|bar|krumpir}} would not sound as different as the spelling would suggest, as for example in Bavarian pronunciation voicing is lost and one distinguishes g k as ''lenis'' (unaspirated) and ''fortis'' (aspirated). For similar reason, we have keep all entries Swahili has borrowed from {{w|Hindustani language|Hindustani}} as [[:Category:Swahili terms borrowed from Hindi|borrowed from Hindi]], not keeping a [[:Category:Swahili terms borrowed from Urdu|borrowed from Urdu]]. Or we keep a [[:Category:Arabic terms borrowed from Aramaic]]¬†for terms borrowed from various ages and various dialects (the distinction of {{w|Aramaic language|Aramaic languages}} is controversial and the more so is ascribing Arabic words to any dialect or stage of them). Our distinctions between languages are imperfect, and sometimes they do not even need to be perfect. And on the other hand we Wiktionary editors in 2019 might be more careful than some academic twenty years ago.
:Think about this, Panda: If somebody compiles an etymological dictionary, will every etymology be equally well-founded? No, because he needs to offer a complete book to his audience, from which follows that he writes an etymology to any common word, although his knowledge is not perfect in all, and in fact because our time to study word histories is limited and we do not track down the actual reality of every word most etymologies are only good with a certain probability. This is why Wiktionary has an advantage in that editors only add some etymologies they know and leave others they don‚Äôt know unsolved or ambiguous. Or in this way the stated origin will be inexact: {{cog|hu|ribizli}} is ‚Äúfrom {{cog|bar|ribisl}}‚Äù or ‚Äúfrom {{cog|AG.|Ribisel}}‚Äù, it is indistinct, as some [[:Category:Arabic terms borrowed from Iranian languages|Arabic words]] are borrowed from the {{w|Iranian languages|Iranian language group}}, without us being able to pin-point any. You just must be able to see where distinction, and adhering to the distinctions stated in some books, starts to be an inane academic sport. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 20:55, 9 August 2019 (UTC)
:: Wow, okay, thanks for the detailed explanation and clarification. It is true that I try to stay as close as possible to the referenced source. I do see other editors make changes based on new research and such, but most of the time no source is cited for those changes and they leave the original reference there. But that aside, I have two more sources. According to {{R:Zaicz 2006}} it was first attested in "1720, borrowed from German, more closely from Bavarian, compare Austrian German ribizl, riwisl, Tyrolean ribesl, Austrian German Ribisel, Ribisl. These are from the Old German or dialectal German noun ''ribes''." The third source {{R:Eory 2007}} provides a very short etymology, it simply says "borrowed from German, more closely from Bavarian." Go ahead and make your changes, but please remove the reference I added since the etymology will no longer match the source. I am not saying that etymology dictionaries are always accurate, but in another etymology discussion I was instructed that "if there is a reference given and we choose to refer to it, we need to faithfully adhere to whatever is given there". Thanks again for taking the time to respond. [[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 21:42, 9 August 2019 (UTC)
::: Which of course sounds like one has copied from the other. 1720 is however a number. {{ping|Panda10}} The question about these sources would still be: What do they mean with Bavarian? That Hungarians have collected it in Bavaria, i.e.‚ÄØBayern, or picked it up from people from Bayern that conversed with Hungarians in Hungaria? Or does Bavarian include Austrian? In this case I maybe was more specific, but there is always the option of quoting the crucial words of the etymologist in the reference tag so there is no mismatch (we also often add the references in the reference sections only without reference tags specifically because we do not claim exactly the same but a similar thing or a part of what is in the source). Here you see how these sources still need to be interpreted, and it is actually easy to misinterpret sources, for example as more exact than they intended to be ‚Äì also the various forms given make German look more diverse than is real: they quote ‚ÄúAustrian German ribizl, riwisl, Tyrolean ribesl, Austrian German Ribisel, Ribisl‚Äù and from such lists one already computes a ‚Äú{{w|Linguistic distance|lexical distance}}‚Äù, while these aren‚Äôt the relevant details (if one collected all those differences one might become like that Albanian you-know-whom-I-mean). Still, I am German and have copious knowledge of the history of German language but I don‚Äôt know what ‚ÄúOld German‚Äù is, which is why you don‚Äôt find a language code on Wiktionary for it ‚Äì analogically, perchance what you see as ‚ÄúBavarian‚Äù¬†in sources should not be in Wiktionary as ‚ÄúBavarian‚Äù. There is {{w|Old High German}}¬†but that is up to 1050 AD. I have indeed looked through uses of the German word and I don‚Äôt see that ‚Äúribes‚Äù or ‚ÄúRibes‚Äù (capitalization is irrelevant here) is a dialectal noun ‚Äì if it does occur in text, then it is indistinguishable from Latin, like in [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gtRAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA157&dq=%22der+Ribes%22 this example from 1616]. The fact of Latin ''Ribes'' becoming {{cog|de|Ribisel}} through a ‚ÄúGerman ''Ribes''‚Äù is something hardly observable, that‚Äôs why I prefer to shortcut the etymology by saying only that {{cog|de|Ribisel}} is from {{cog|la|ribes}}. Well yeah, you copy what the etymologists say, but I always try to find the underlying forms, and German is very well documented and accessible, that is the most common reason why (my) Wiktionary etymologies might be adjusted or cautiously modified compared to what is found in etymological dictionaries. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 22:44, 9 August 2019 (UTC)
:::: Since we are not able to find a reliable source for the exact German origin and since I can't answer your question about Old German and Bavarian, how about this format: "First attested in 1720. Borrowed from German, more specifically from Bavarian-Austrian German. Compare Austrian German Ribisel." This statement is supported by the Hungarian printed sources and it also includes your previous etymology, although not as a straight borrowing, only a "compare". If you agree to this, I will make the change. [[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 17:17, 10 August 2019 (UTC)
::::: {{ping|Panda10}}: Better write: ‚ÄúBavarian-Austrian German, represented by Austrian German ‚ÄúRibisel‚Äù, so we do not pretend it would essentially different (we also overuse the word ‚Äúcompare‚Äù for various dissimilar purposes). Or just ‚ÄúBavarian-Austrian ''Ribisel'' (since the Bavarian, if distinct, can be written the same as Austrian: as I said, the underlying form is [ÀàriÀêbiÀêzlÃ©], however one writes it). Perhaps: ‚ÄúFrom Bavarian-Austrian [ÀàriÀêbiÀêzlÃ©]‚Äù, this IPA linking to {{m|de|Ribisel}}? [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 17:26, 10 August 2019 (UTC)
:::::: I made the change. I hope you will accept it without further tweaking. :) Thanks again for your cooperation. [[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 17:37, 10 August 2019 (UTC)

== I promised, but ==

Fay! I know i promised you ([[Talk:Œ∫œçœÑŒøœÇ|here]]) to do other things rather than Modern Greek etymologies, but they keep coming up (needed for affix Cats etc). A special Category is needed! Would it be realistic to ask for one? Or would it be a silly question to the ears of linguists?<br>The PROBLEM: As you pointed out, the Category of inherited words from previous greek phases ([[:Category:Greek inherited terms|CAT]]) is too large.  Many of them are 'learned internal borrowings' rather than direct inheritances. Some dictionaries mark lemmata as such, others do not. But they all refer to them in their introductions with terms like 'learned diachronic borrowings', 'revivals', 'reinvigorated words' (my translations). Distinct from 'learned borrowings' ([[:Category:Greek learnedly borrowed terms|CAT]]), which concern 'external learned borrowings'.<br>In {{temp|R:DSMG}} the estimated [+learned] lemmata (of all kinds) are approx.30,000 and the [-learned] up to 20,000.
At the moment, we add manually <code><nowiki>Learnedly, from {{inh|el|grc|....}}</nowiki></code>, or we do not add an etymology at all, avoiding the problem. In effect the 'inherited' categories have become too large. I do not know how often this occurs in other languages, but it is very frequent for greek. Should I pursue the matter or just drop it? Shukran. [[User:Sarri.greek|sarri.greek]] ([[User talk:Sarri.greek|talk]]) 11:08, 12 September 2019 (UTC)
:If you know the origin word but not whether it is borrowed or inherited you are free to use the fallback template {{temp|der}} ‚Äì better than ‚Äúnot add an etymology at all‚Äù. Personally I have never used {{temp|lbor}}, or tried to distinguish ‚Äúlearned borrowings‚Äù from ‚Äúnon-learned-borrowings‚Äù.
:Clearly if you value your time you won‚Äôt go through the Greek entries to find what they are. The relevancy of that detail is much less than adding words, senses, quotes. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 16:36, 12 September 2019 (UTC)

== Kipchak as an Ancestor ==

Your edits at [[qan]] and [[–∫—ä–∞–Ω]] caused module errors. When I went to Wikipedia to try to figure out what was wrong, I found confusion as to whether Kipchak is the ancestor of all the Kipchak languages, or one of the Kipchak languages in one of the branches. Rather than reverting your edits or converting {{tl|inh}} to {{tl|der}}, I thought it better to ask your help in sorting this out. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 17:05, 19 October 2019 (UTC)
:{{ping|Chuck Entz}} I just answered the arising question on {{section link|Module_talk:languages#Some Kipchak languages have Kipchak set as ancestor, some not}}. I wondered first where to post and whether I should just post it on my talk page for someone would come here to see it but it would be kind of odd and now its there. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 17:53, 19 October 2019 (UTC)
::{{ping|Fay Freak}}, {{ping|Anylai}}, {{ping|Allahverdi Verdizade}}, I see multiple problems about you assigning this "Kipchak" as the ancestor to (whatever) list of Kypchak languages.
:: One of the is that the entire premise is IMHO wrong that there existed a single language from which the modern Kypchak languages have developed. I am not aware of any Turkologists stipulating and/or supporting this premise. Please let me know if you know such.
:: I would urge you to reconsider this decision of yours. I bet we will be much safer if we don't introduce such new entity as "Kipchak". [[User:Borovi4ok|Borovi4ok]] ([[User talk:Borovi4ok|talk]]) 07:48, 21 October 2019 (UTC)
:: As far as I know, "Kipchak" is mostly used in etymology sections to refer to cognates found in "Codex cumanicus", a XIII century dictionary, and alike. It is of course not an ancestor of Tatar, Kirghiz and so on. Maybe Proto-Kipchak is (in the same way as Proto-Oghuz is the unattested ancestor of the [[w:Oghuz languages]].) [[User:Allahverdi Verdizade|Allahverdi Verdizade]] ([[User talk:Allahverdi Verdizade|talk]]) 08:54, 21 October 2019 (UTC)
::: {{ping|Allahverdi Verdizade|Borovi4ok}}: It was set so. The more surprising it is that it was set as ancestor to Bashkir and Tatar but not Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Karaim, Kumyk, although the general view is that Crimean Tatar is what developed in the {{w|Crimean Khanate}} after the {{w|Kipchak Khanate}} fell apart. This entity ‚ÄúKipchak‚Äù is attested in various medieval works apart from the Codex Cumanicus, which is just the most popular, for example the grammar and glossary edited [[T:R:qwm:Houtsma|1894 by Houtsma]] or that by {{w|lang=pl|Ananiasz ZajƒÖczkowski}} 1954‚Äì58 under the title ''S≈Çownik arabsko-kipczacki z okresu Pa≈Ñstwa Mameluckiego''. Some other sources are listed by √Årp√°d Berta ''Deverbale Wortbildung im Mittelkiptschakisch-T√ºrkischen'' 1996 p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mRJoOibsH7AC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&f=false 3‚Äì7]. So in the 13th century, weren‚Äôt the languages mutually intelligible? As I said Arab authors from that era consistently treat a ‚ÄúKipchak‚Äù language, as in the sources I have just given.

Yet nobody would conceive the idea of introducing an obscure Proto-Arabic we would have to derive all dialect forms from. The same way an idea of an additional Proto-Kipchak is expendable. Even if we had witnesses from the 9th or 7th centuries you would still not be satisfied and shout that this is not what Bashkir and Tatar derive from. You will always find dialectal differences.

Now, everything you are saying does not give ground to assume that there was a single parent language that gave rise to all modern Kipchak languages.

== Using sense-id or providing a gloss ==
Which one do you think is more preferential when giving definitions in non-English entries, and why? I tried to use sense-id to conserve space before, but it was quite bothersome since most English definitions lack ID:s, and because it entails more work for the editor. Also, without usage examples or qualifiers, the reader has to go to the English definition anyway; and since a definition link with a sense-ID looks exactly the same as one without, the user doesn't know that s/he can get more information by following the definition link. <small> –ù—É –∏ –ø–æ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–ª—é, —á—Ç–æ –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞—é –ª–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —á–∏—Ç–∞–±–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ, –∞ –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—ã–Ω—é –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä—ë—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞—Ö.

:{{ping|Allahverdi Verdizade}}¬†I am not sure what your dilemma is. I use sense-IDs if there are multiple things in a language section that are sufficiently clearly defined and thus expected by me to be stable, just so people jump to the intended sense merely for their convenience, not to specify anything they would not find without it. I never added sense IDs to English entries to specify glosses, and glosses should be clear in what sense they mean without linking to any English sense. If there are only horribly polysemous words in English (which lackily enough is only rarely, not like that we always have to use English like Indians or non-Anglosaxon computer scientists) then I also do not shy away to write a German or Latin etc. gloss nearby, as professional dictionaries also do sometimes, and it also helps mnemonics, rewarding polyglots. For example in {{m|ota|⁄Øÿ≤|tr=gez}} you read the definition: ‚Äú[[time]] in the sense of ‚Äúone time‚Äù, ‚Äútwo times‚Äù, ‚Äúthree times‚Äù (or in other words, what {{noncog|fr|fois}}, {{noncog|de|Mal}}, {{noncog|ru|—Ä–∞–∑|tr=-}}, {{noncog|sh|p»ót}})‚Äù. Specifically for this sense English and German and probably Serbo-Croatian dictionaries ''sometimes'' clarify with {{noncog|fr|fois}}, since {{noncog|en|time}}¬†is colorless and there is at least one other {{noncog|de|Mal}} and {{noncog|sh|put}}¬†has several abstract meanings. Or in {{m|ota|€åÿß€å|tr=yay}}: ‚Äú[[spring]], [[coil]] <small>‚Äì {{l|de|[[Sprungfeder]]}}</small>‚Äù. I have also read: ‚Äúa spring in machinery‚Äù, but this is less [[iconic]], and it is preferably ‚Äúboom, this is what is meant‚Äù. Many people specify senses of polysemous terms wrongly. They write: ‚ÄúOrange (fruit)‚Äù where one has to ask: Not an orange tree? Mostly it is also an orange tree, but the editors had bad teachers. When I write ‚Äú(plant)‚Äù or ‚Äú(fruit)‚Äù it rather really means it is only the plant respectively only the fruit, which is distinguished depending on the plant. Same thing with the labels: In former days one used labels now reflected as ‚Äú{{temp|lb|en|botany}}‚Äù, ‚Äú{{temp|lb|en|anatomy}}‚Äù etc. excessively but those should be used only if the terms are really only used in the respective scientific fields, not to contextualize. Hence I wrote on {{m|ota|ÿ¢ÿ∫ÿ≤|tr=aƒüƒ±z}} ‚Äúmouth in the most primitive sense‚Äù, not ‚Äú{{temp|lb|en|anatomy}} mouth‚Äù as many people would do and which is wrong.

::Ah I see, it never crossed my mind that one could use both sense-id and a gloss. As for providing definitions in other languages, I am not against it in principle, I even think it is a good idea (provided that definitions in other languages are somehow marked with another font or alike; also, I think providing definitions in other languages should be restricted to a handful of relevant languages; giving a Swedish gloss in an Azerbaijani entry just because I know Swedish better than English would be weird).

In the nonpast the prefix becomes invisible because the alif is only to fill the void / to comply with the syllabification rule that says that Arabic words cannot start with two consonants or a mere vowel (even though it is not alif wa·π£l). But even more interesting, it occurs that this Proto-Semitic causative prefix *≈° is retained regularly as {{m|ar|ÿ≥}} in the  verb {{ar-form|X|nocap=1}}, the {{m|ar|ÿ™}} there being the same infix as the one in {{ar-form|VIII|nocap=1}}, which lets you see that the original meaning of {{ar-form|X|nocap=1}} is ‚Äúto prompt (IV) someone to do something by himself (VIII)‚Äù.
: And yes, the prefix in the Arabic masculine singular elative is the same prefix. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 13:17, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
:: Thank you!! I do know of the general sound change (and I only found out about the relationship between forms IV and X this last month, mind-blowing), but what happened was I mentioned the {{m|ar|ŸáŸÄ}} + {{m|ar|ŸÑŸêŸÄ}} etymology of {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÑ}} to somebody and I realized I didn't have a source to back it up beyond "it's on Wiktionary." I don't have a copy of Tropper -- nor, as you noticed, can I read German (maybe at some point lol) -- but it's good to have a citation to refer to.
:: While I'm here, though, can you actually comment on the plausibility of the counter-argument I got in response? It was that {{m|ar|ÿ£ŸéŸÄ}} < {{m|ar|*ŸáŸéŸÄ}} is in fact unrelated to {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÑ}}, and they challenged the {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÄ}} + {{m|ar|ŸÑŸêŸÄ}} derivation because (1) it's unlikely for {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÑ}} to have magically been generalized into being able to appear before nouns (considering that {{m|ar|ŸÑŸêŸÄ}} can't precede anything but a verb), and (2) there are [https://twitter.com/PhDniX/status/1206698965586137088 many records] of old CA dialects where {{m|ar|ŸÑŸêŸÄ}} never underwent the change where it lost its ''i'' vowel. Instead, they said, {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÑ}} is derived from an old Semitic particle ''*hal'' used for calling attention, and it's "cognate to Ugaritic ''hl''". I can't gauge the accuracy of this myself.

::: It‚Äôs not magical but explained as [[rebracketing]], the {{lang|ar|ŸÑ}} fusing and losing its meaning; starting thus from verbal sentences and after that usable for nominal sentences (which are less default than the verbal sentences anyway). I find the thought odd that the {{m|uga|êéÖêéç|t=behold!}}, which in the Dictionary of the Ugaritic Language is compared to {{m|ar|ŸáŸéŸÑ}}, could have acquired the meaning of introducing a polar question, which would mean such a sentence in Arabic could start without any special word and was marked only by intonation as in Spanish, with the particle later added for emphasis. Unless we should not go from the Ugaritic meaning; anyhow the Ugaritic meaning seems far to me. Don‚Äôt know what that {{cog|akk|íÄ†íáª|tr=al-lu|ts=all≈´(mi)|t=is it not?}}, (it is from the Amarna period and suspected to be a West Semitic derivation), in the DUL is but it fits phonetically apparently to neither.

== Semitic languages' classification used in Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic descendants ==

I've noticed while editing some entries that each one of them uses different classifications (or none for that matter) to classify its descendants, which makes it hard to maintain in the future. I am planning on refactoring the descendants according to Hetzron 1997 classification used in [[wikipapers:Semitic_languages#Classification|here]]. I don't know if there are any Proto-Semitic knowledgable people in here, but your last edit on [[Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/Œ∏a ølab-]] suggests that you know a bit about Proto-Semitic phonology. [[User:Fenakhay|Fenakhay]] ([[User talk:Fenakhay|talk]]) 19:33, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
:There are no classifications, nor are there any needed. I am sorry for those who believed their groupings are subfamilies. They are just groupings to help the eye con the data. An alleged split between West and East Semitic is conventional and beyond what one can recognize. The grouping of Arabic is most controversial, hence ‚ÄúCentral Semitic‚Äù is no group. A group ‚ÄúNorthwest Semitic‚Äù appears to make sense but Ugaritic may or may not be in it, some put it in some ‚ÄúNorth Semitic‚Äù, which in other terminology is everything not ‚ÄúSouth Semitic‚Äù, i.e. of the known ones Old South Arabian, Modern South Arabian and Ethiopian, which may or may not be a group but is mostly a conglomeration of isoglosses (the cause of which does not need to be assumed a common split from a state in which the feature can be assumed to have been present already).

== Trailing glottal stop ==

Tbh I‚Äôve been thinking about it and I agree with you that we shouldn‚Äôt transliterate  æ in the Aramaic emphatic state. It makes sense for the transcription of purely consonantal writing systems like Phonecian or Ugaritic where an alef is the only means of indicating an initial or final vowel. But for languages like Aramaic where vowels are indicated by diacritical marks the transliteration of final emphatic ‹ê is redundant. I‚Äôm also beginning to prefer the use of ‚ü® î‚ü© and ‚ü® ï‚ü© over ‚ü® æ‚ü© and ‚ü® ø‚ü© for Semitic transliteration in general. I like {{ping|M. I.

== Dates for quotations ==

See [[WT:QUOTE]]. We are supposed to have dates for quotations. For many citations there are problems with editions, orthography, copyist errors, etc. But dates or date ranges are helpful to sequence citations and to help our more normal users get some sense of the history of usage. Links to WP and to references can help users understand some of the issues in dating quotations. [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 21:37, 11 February 2020 (UTC)
:Dates are impossible here; the best one can do is say "compiled 6th century" or something like that. In general, I think this is a waste of other editors' time; if you want every quotation to have some date attached to it, you might as well click through to Wikipedia and add the century of compilation yourself rather than a request that cannot be filled if interpreted literally. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 21:42, 11 February 2020 (UTC)
:{{re|DCDuring}} I can sequence citations without it, and [[Wiktionary:Quotations]] clearly was not written with antiquity in mind, anyway nobody is supposed to do what is impossible. And it‚Äôs not usual in Classical Philology to quote with dates either, and I suppose that usually our users are not normal either, a hint on the author is enough for anyone mildly oriented in history or being able to click the link to Wikipedia. So {{temp|Q}} does not require it either. Many much-used works are only datable very vaguely; to this date the herbal most-used in the Middle Ages {{w|Pseudo-Apuleius}} is only datable to ‚Äúthe 4th century‚Äù and it is not known whether its beginning or end. And that‚Äôs only with one herbal; with timeless religious and legal writings it is even more impossible. Some auhtors are famous, Ulpian on {{l|la|cancellus}} I could fill with some years uncertainty by searching half an hour some opinions on its dating, but the ''datings stay mere opinions'' and for earlier jurists their life data is not known, and some also is without author like {{w|Pauli Sententiae}} from the same century. So what, DCDuring? I tell you one cannot fill them without ridiculous inexactitude; {{w|Gaius Octavius Tidius Tossianus Lucius Javolenus Priscus|Javolenus}} is {{temp|circa|100¬±20 or 40}}, the Vulgate is {{temp|circa|100‚Äì382}} (does not really differ from the {{w|Vetus Latina|Itala}} versions). Do you agree with such dating? I must contend though that the way dates are displayed is not most suitable for such ranges ‚Äì even the templates are made not for antiquity, where vague dates are the rule.¬†[[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 22:16, 11 February 2020 (UTC)
::{{reply to|Metaknowledge}} Some editors are already wasting their time adding date and work title to the Shakespeare quotations that lack them. My plan is to economize on my time by adding the dates in batches, eg, by author using WP articles where author and work are known, by author where work is not shown using a modified rfdatek search for the pagename and the author at Google search. I have to do something different for translated works, for which we sometimes show the date of the original work, not that of the translation. Chaucer is interesting because there are three major manuscript fragments of the Tales. It would be nice to date quotations by the estimated date of the manuscripts.
::{{reply to|Fay Freak}} Date ranges can be two years or multiple centuries (even millennia I suppose). If the standard templates don't work, one can either do a custom header or create a template for the work. Obviously, this last approach only pays if the work is the source of many citations. Obvious examples in English are the EME bibles, but see [[:Category:English quotation templates]].
::Admittedly it is much easier to work with modern texts, especially those that never were revised by the authors or editors and where orthography is standardized. I am grateful that many of the authors of undated English citations from older texts (and sometimes the texts themselves) have WP articles that either have reasonable dates or can speed the search for them from other sources.

In Deiner vorhergehenden Bearbeitung dagegen gab es keine Spur von so einer Behauptung. Nimm es mir bitte nicht √ºbel, aber die Behauptung, da√ü irgend ein bulgarisches Wort von einer Mundart, die vor kaum 80 Jahren als eigenst√§ndige Sprache ausgerufen wurde, ist unhaltbar, gelinde gesagt. Wenn Du mehr √ºber die Herkunft eines bulgarischen Wortes erfahren m√∂chtest, so eignet sich das [https://ibl.bas.bg/ber/ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –µ—Ç–∏–º–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ–Ω —Ä–µ—á–Ω–∏–∫] gut zu diesem Zweck.

Gru√ü, [[User:Bogorm|Bogorm]] [[User talk:Bogorm|conver≈øation]] 10:54, 20 April 2020 (UTC)
* {{re|Bogorm}} Das Mazedonische war schon vorher vorhanden, wenngleich es weniger als eigenst√§ndige Sprache ''erkannt'' worden ist. Aber gleich, dann ist das Wort eben dem Serbokroatischen entlehnt, ist dies leichter als ein √úbergang in die mazedonische Mundart des Bulgarischen und dann ins Bulgarische? Ich verwahre mich gegen die Unterstellung, da√ü es ein ur- oder auch nur gemeinslawisches {{m|sla-pro||*pluta}} gegeben habe. Wie Snoj feststellt und ich her√ºbertragen habe, ist das slowenische {{m|sl|pl√∫ta}} im 18. Jahrhundert aus dem Kroatischen entlehnt worden (bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts sprach man in Kroatien {{m|sh|pl»ïta}}, neuerdings {{m|sh|pl»ïto}}). Wenn dies so ist, dann ist das Wort nach urslawischer Zeit neugebildet worden und alle W√∂rter sind Entlehnungen oder Lehn√ºbersetzungen au√üer einem neugebildeten, dem serbokroatischen eben, da das bulgarische doch nur von beschr√§nkter Verbreitung ist und die mazedonische Standardsprache ohnehin halb und halb dem Serbokroatischen nachgeahmt ist. Ebenso wie Serbokroatisch {{m|sh|—Å–ª–∞–¥–æ–ª–µ–¥}} in alle anderen s√ºdslawischen Sprachen entlehnt worden ist. Eine urslawische Bezeichnung f√ºr den Kork gab es nicht. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 11:27, 20 April 2020 (UTC)
* {{re|Bogorm}} Das bulgarische W√∂rterbuch hat f√ºr das Wort Belege nicht √§lter als aus dem neunzehnten Jahrhundert, oder hast du bessere Belege f√ºr das Wort? Zu diesem Zeitpunkte kann man doch wohl einen mazedonischen Lekt erkennen, ob man ihn nun Mazedonisch oder Vardarisch nennt? Und die nicht diesem Lekt zugeh√∂rige damalige bulgarische Sprache kann Ausdr√ºcke demselben entlehnen? Daf√ºr kommt es doch nicht darauf an, ob etwas eine Sprache ist oder eine Mundart oder eine Sondergruppensprache. Auch ein einzelner Mensch kann von einem anderen Einzelmenschen entlehnen, ein Schriftsteller von einem anderen. [[Talk:ÿ≤ÿ±ŸàÿØŸäÿ©|Dergleichen]] wie ‚ÄúThere's no thing as borrowing from Algerian Arabic [into Moroccan Arabic] since that whole region is a dialectal continuum‚Äù ist nur eine kollektivistische Sprachregelung, die davon abh√§lt, √ºber den Weg des Wortes zu reden.

*: Tja, schade, da√ü wir √ºber die nordmazedonische Mundart nicht √ºbereinkommen. Aber im Bulgarischen Etymologischen W√∂rterbuch findest Du sie (mit dieser Bezeichnung) nicht, sondern mit der regionalen Bezeichnung, d. h. mit der Erw√§hnung der Stadt, in deren Umgebung ein Wort vorkommt(z. B. –©–∏–ø, –û—Ö—Ä–∏–¥ usw.). In zwei Punkten widersprichst Du aber dem Artikel aus dem W√∂rterbuch, zum einen, da√ü es das Urslawische Substantiv nicht gegeben habe (schon gut, ich kann es aus der Etymologie entfernen und als Ergebnis wird stehen, da√ü das Wort aus dem urslawischen Verb mit der Substantivierung -ta gebildet wurde), und zum anderen, da√ü alle Entlehnungen aus dem Serbokroatischen seien. Im W√∂rterbuch wird ausdr√ºcklich erkl√§rt, da√ü das rum√§nische Wort eine Entlehnung aus dem Bulgarischen ist (steht auch im Artikel hier, wobei ich rum√§nische Lemmata in der Regel nicht bearbeite, also stammt von jemand anderem). Eine Entlehnung aus dem Serbokroatischen ins Bulgarische wird nicht erw√§hnt.
*: –ü–ª—É—Ç–æ wird jedoch im W√∂rterbuch als Nebenform mit einer Abk√ºrzung angef√ºhrt und Du schriebst soeben, da√ü es auch in Kroatien zu finden ist? Im √∂stlichen Teil des Serbokroatischen also nicht? Im Bulgarischen doch. K√∂nnte das darauf hindeuten, da√ü es ein urslawisches Wort gab mit einer Nebenform auf -o, die im √∂stlichen Teil des Serbokroatischen nicht vorhanden ist? Ist nur eine Vermutung. Fay Freak, ich finde diese Aussage: "das bulgarische doch nur von beschr√§nkter Verbreitung" verbl√ºffend. Wie kommst Du darauf? Die bulgarische Sprache wurde vor 1913 von Ohrid bis Tultscha und im S√ºdosten bis zur Linie [[:w:Medea (Thrace)|Media]]-[[:w:Rhaedestus|Rhaedestus]] (als Grenze vorgeschlagen am Ende des Balkankrieges w√§hrend der Friedensverhandlungen) gesprochen (kein geringes Areal).
*: Das Lekt, wie Du es nennst, wird in der bulgarischen Sprachwissenschaft meist als s√ºdwestliche bulgarische Dialekte der jeweiligen St√§dte (–©–∏–ø, –°–∫–æ–ø–∏–µ usw.) betrachtet, die mit nordwestlichen oder nord√∂stlichen oder s√ºd√∂stlichen als ebenb√ºrtig (ebenb√ºrtige bulgarische Dialekte) angesehen werden. 
*: (''Und die nicht diesem Lekt zugeh√∂rige damalige bulgarische Sprache'') Das finde ich als Bulgare hinsichtlich des gerade ausgelegten Standpunktes der bulgarischen Sprachwissenschaft (√ºber die Ebenb√ºrtigkeit der bulgarischen Dialekte, inklusive der s√ºdwestlichen) auch verbl√ºffend.

Das bulgarische Wort, nicht die bulgarische Sprache! Die Gro√ü- und Kleinschreibung ist wichtig. Ich hab nun wieder in das Bulgarische Etymologische W√∂rterbuch geschaut und siehe da, genannt sind vor allem Orte in Mazedonien (–©–∏–ø, –û—Ö—Ä–∏–¥ nennst du ‚Ä¶), einige an der rum√§nischen Grenze und sogar das Banat (also Serbien?), insgesamt jedoch einige kleine Orte. Da der Balkan eben balkanisiert ist und es √ºberall Sprachinseln gibt oder vor allem gab wo jede Sprache auf jede treffen kann, ist aber entscheidend nicht nur die Verbreitung im w√∂rtlichen Sinne, also die Entfernung, auf die sich das Wort findet, sondern die Dichte, die H√§ufigkeit, in der sich das Wort antrifft. Und da siehst du, da√ü sich im Standardbulgarischen das Wort schwerlich auffinden l√§√üt ‚Äì eben weil es der bulgarischen Sprache fremd ist, ist der nat√ºrliche Schlu√ü. Das Vorhandensein von Nebenformen, √ºbrigens, wird eher als Argument benutzt, um eine Entlehnung zu untermauern (so wie in unseren altgriechischen Eintr√§gen immer so etwas steht wie ¬ªthe presence of variants points to a Pre-Greek origin¬´, und arabische Entlehnung aus dem aram√§ischen hat [[T:R:ar:Fraenkel|Fraenkel]] oft so begr√ºndet, und ich habe die aram√§ischen Lehnw√∂rter im Arabischen abgearbeitet und kann die Richtigkeit best√§tigen).
::: Und was von der Ebenb√ºrtigkeit? Du hast es nicht beantwortet, ob es falsch w√§re, es so zu sehen, da√ü ein Wort √ºber mehrere Dialekte entlehnt wird. Wor√ºber √ºbereinkommen? Es ist f√ºr diese Angelegenheit wumpe, ob das Mazedonische eine Sprache ist oder nicht oder war oder nicht. Der Punkt ist (es sind nicht zwei Punkte), das Wort hat an einem Orte (doch nicht gleichl√§ufig an verschiedenen Orten!) seinen Anfang genommen und ist in der fr√ºhen Neuzeit √ºberallhin entlehnt worden; das gilt f√ºr dieses Wort wie f√ºr Deutsch {{m|de|Kork}} ([https://www.dwds.de/wb/Kork 17. Jahrhundert]), Englisch {{m|en|cork}}, Arabisch {{m|ar|ŸÅŸêŸÑŸêŸëŸäŸÜ}} (kommt in der altklassischen Sprache nicht vor) und fast alle anderen W√∂rter in den √úbersetzungen unter {{m|en|cork}}. Es ist daher auch irref√ºhrend zu schreiben ‚Äúfrom Proto-Slavic *pluti‚Äù. Am Einfachsten ist es, anzunehmen, da√ü das Wort im Serbokroatischen seinen Ursprung genommen hat. Denkbar w√§re auch Ursprung in mazedonischen Dialekten, doch das hie√üe wiederum, das bulgarische Wort ist aus dem Mazedonischen entlehnt, und das serbokroatische Wort w√§re dem mazedonischen entlehnt, und [[:Category:Serbo-Croatian terms derived from Macedonian|Entlehnungen aus dem Mazedonischen ins Serbokroatischen]] kommen kaum je vor, und der Protest w√§re bei dieser Annahme noch gr√∂√üer.

Ich werde das demzufolge aus dem Artikel entfernen und vorerst das Serbokroatische beibehalten, wenngleich Petar Skok in seinem W√∂rterbuch (Standardwerk ''Etimologijski rjeƒçnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'') keine Entlehnungen dieses Substantivs in andere slawische Sprachen erw√§hnt. Skok selbst verwendet jedoch dieses Substantiv als Maskulin, ''plut''. Aber wenn nicht Skok, welche Quelle hast Du f√ºr die Entlehnung dieses Wortes aus dem Serbokroatischen ins Bulgarische? Es existieren zumindest Entlehnungen aus dem Serbokroatischen ins Bulgarische (im Unterschied zur anderen Version, die wir gerade besprochen haben). Es ist vollkommen nachvollziehbar, warum eine alte Sprache wie die Serbokroatische keine Entlehnungen aus einer als Sprache erst vor 80 Jahren ausgerufenen Mundart kennt (eben deshalb w√ºrde der Widerstand gro√ü sein, weil das unhaltbar ist), aber das war nicht unser Thema.

I think you'll have to elaborate a little bit if you want to claim specifically Kurdish origin of the Azerbaijani term.[[User:Allahverdi Verdizade|Allahverdi Verdizade]] ([[User talk:Allahverdi Verdizade|talk]]) 14:30, 3 May 2020 (UTC)
:{{re|Allahverdi Verdizade}}¬†It‚Äôs not pretty far-fetched and the Persian forms do not fit ‚Äì some authors even called the origin unknown because the Persian is too far while they did not know the Kurdish form. (And the ultimate Iranian origin of the word family is of course assumed without question.) In the case of {{m|ota|⁄ØŸÑŸá|tr=g√ºlle}}, I am sure that the Arabic word, widespread is in Syria (dialect map linked in {{m|ar|ŸÉŸÑÿ©|tr=gulle}} for the meaning ‚Äúmarble‚Äù), is from Kurdish and so is the Ottoman. The word {{m|tr|tuman}}¬†is not and never was part of Standard Turkish but is only (still) used in some areas you might list further so this is not a learned borrowing either but it appears to be from close contact. And some words must be from Kurdish, right, with its so many speakers and it being actually between Turkish and Persian? Else we should ask what {{ping|Raxshaan}} knows more about Iranian forms of this trouser-word, but those other Iranian languages are much smaller. What I have lets me seem Kurdish origin more likely than Persian origin, and there aren‚Äôt options really other than deeming one or the other Iranian word the origin of the Turkish and Azerbaijani word or resignating. Or what, Persian ‚Üí Azerbaijani ‚Üí¬†Turkish ‚Üí Kurdish? Shouldn‚Äôt be such a brain-scratcher. (We can‚Äôt reach certainty however, as we lack data what happened some centuries ago in traditional costume affairs in the Near East, that is also certain.) [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 20:54, 3 May 2020 (UTC)
::Mere surmise, sir. Instead of claiming the unlikely Kurdish origin, it's more plausible to posit separate borrowings from Persian ‚Üí Turkish, Persian ‚Üí Azerbaijani, Persian ‚Üí Kurdish.
::If you want a more specific explanation (which is of course equally speculative but still more plausable) , I would suggest Fa. t√¥b√¢n > Ott, Az tuman > Ku. T√ªman.

Plus, as you see the Middle Persian word did perfectly survive into New Persian, in modern Persian is most used to denote "a White Horse" but in Classical New Persian, it's preserved its semantic as an adjective meaning "white". In various Lori and Bakhtiyari dialects of Persian the word is still preserved as "white" especially in Bakhtiyari dialect, but in other dialects, it has undergone a semantic deviation and means "a white-forehead ship".

Hi, I found the Middle Persian equivalent of this word in ''Pahlavica'' (find it in the references of the word) but I cannot copy-paste the book pahlavi. Is there a way? {{unsigned|Mazsch|20:51, 3 January 2021 (UTC)}}
:{{re|Mazsch}}¬†No, because Book Pahlavi has no Unicode code points, and it is uncertain when it will be encoded due to [https://corp.unicode.org/~roozbeh/pahlavi-model.pdf the indistinctness of the Pahlavi writing]. For this reason there are no entries in it here but many in Latin transcription. We add script requests <small>[Book Pahlavi needed]</small> in the hope that in a distant future somebody will finally have the code points and leisure to fulfil Book Pahlavi requests. Currently it is ''impossible'' in spite of there being requests. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 22:58, 3 January 2021 (UTC)

== Removal of Cognates from [[lacrima]] ==
Hi. Just  wondering what the reasoning behind the removal of any references to cognates is in the latin section for lacrima? I had found it a useful mention, but don't know that etymology enough to puzzle out why it was removed without comment. --[[User:Kirageous|Kirageous]] ([[User talk:Kirageous|talk]]) 14:20, 10 January 2021 (UTC)
:{{re|Kirageous}} I cut at the [[User talk:Victar#Truncating Germanic etymologies|first blue link]] ‚Äì there is a page of a reconstructed ancestor providing the same. In a sense that can be applied coherently, these mentions are therefore not useful because their function is fulfilled already. So it seemed useful to you but in a different, relevant sense it is not useful, and for reasons some of which are outlined in the discussion linked it is harmful.

== The Georgians ==

Hello!

As for the name for Georgians in Classical Arabic, it is {{l|ar|ŸÉÿ±ÿ¨}} (which I assume is pronounced "karj", though I am not sure). You can read an interesting, sentimental tale about the {{w|Battle of Garni}} between Queen {{w|Rusudan of Georgia}} and the steadfast believers led by the heroized Muslim sultan, Shah {{w|Jalal ad-Din  Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din}}, in {{w|Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-A·πØƒ´r}}'s histories [https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=fPp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT440&dq=%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiw__eitqXuAhXiURUIHVH1C80QuwUwAnoECAkQCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false here]. (Unsurprisingly, Ibn al-A·πØƒ´r does not mention her name, simply scornfully referring to the ruler of the Krj as "a woman".)

However, I know neither the origins of that designation nor whether there were other ones to refer to that "race", but the modern term, {{l|ar|ÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨Ÿäÿß}}, is most likely a borrowing from English, given its form. [[User:Roger.M.Williams|Roger.M.Williams]] ([[User talk:Roger.M.Williams|talk]]) 12:29, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
:{{re|Roger.M.Williams}} Good to know; I now see it is a known word used in [https://books.google.com/books?id=rylHDwAAQBAJ historical books].¬†The vocalization and etymology lies bare quick to me. It is vocalized {{m|ar|ŸÉŸèÿ±Ÿíÿ¨}} and borrowed specifically from Neo-{{bor|ar|fa|⁄Øÿ±ÿ¨|tr=gurj}}, because in Middle Iranian the first consonant was¬†{{IPAchar|/w/}}, as in earlier-borrowed {{m|ar|ŸàŸéÿ±ŸíÿØ}} against¬†{{cog|fa|⁄ØŸÑ|tr=gul|t=rose}}, in {{m|fa|⁄Øÿ±⁄Ø|tr=gurg|t=wolf}} etc. This is also in {{cog|tr|G√ºrc√º}}¬†/ {{cog|az|g√ºrc√º|t=Georgian}}.
:The Old East Slavic {{m|orv|–≥—É—Ä–∑–∏|t=Georgians}} ‚Üí¬†{{cog|ru|–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏ÃÅ–Ω}} cannot be earlier either. I don‚Äôt know now whether the other Slavic words are inherited from Late Common Slavic or borrowed from (Old) Russian somewhen ‚Äì etymological dictionaries omit such words. Neither {{temp|R:pl:Bory≈õ}} nor {{temp|R:sl:SES}}¬†nor {{temp|R:sl:Bezlaj}} nor {{temp|R:bg:RBE}}¬†contains something about it, even {{temp|R:sla:ESSJa}}¬†omits it though often containing reconstructions of terms that didn‚Äôt really exist in Proto-Slavic. But I tend to assume it is all a recent borrowing, if they do not even find mention necessary, as many such professors restrict themselves to older things to appear more important, and {{cog|de|Grusien}} is an obvious borrowing from Russian, although one wonders whether nobody in Slovenia and Poland and even Bulgaria knew about the country before Russians recounted them. For some absurd reason {{temp|R:DWDS}}¬†does not know the word {{m|de|Georgien}} and nothing from {{w|lang=de|Wolfgang Pfeifer (Etymologe)|Pfeifer}}¬†for {{m|de|Georgier}}¬†which is from the country name only I believe.
:So the question is still not covered by Wiktionary were all these terms in European languages come from. How can it really be that the etymology of the English {{m|en|Georgia}} is unknown? The names in European languages must have spread in a known fashion. The name does not exist in pre-{{w|Boethius}} Latin however. I am going to post to [[WT:Etymology scriptorium]]. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 13:35, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
::{{re|Fay Freak}} Thanks! I could not find an Arabic text that vocalizes the word, which is why I hesitated to create an Arabic entry. I have now added it and also fixed the vocalization of all the mentions of the Arabic word here. [[User:Roger.M.Williams|Roger.M.Williams]] ([[User talk:Roger.M.Williams|talk]]) 14:08, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
:::{{re|Roger.M.Williams}}¬†Thanks. I wrote down the [[Wiktionary:Etymology_scriptorium/2021/January#Georgia|reasonings for all]] meanwhile and got the idea to look into the OED, which omits the country names {{m|en|Georgia}}, {{m|en|Armenia}}, {{m|en|Azerbaijan}}, but contains the English adjective derivations in ''-an''. There I read, transcribed, that in the 9th century one wrote in Arabic {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿèÿ±Ÿíÿ≤ŸéÿßŸÜ}}, <small>derived from them by ‚ÄúSassanian Pahlavi ''wroƒçƒÅn'' or ''wir≈çzƒÅn'' (written wlwc‚Äôan)‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúa smaller area in central Georgia‚Äù; the Pahlavi detail is now irrelevant to us except to illustrate where the ending ''-ƒÅn'' comes from (I [[Talk:ŸÑŸàÿ≤|recently talked about ƒç ‚Üí z in Semitic]]), for only people who want to check if and how Wiktionary‚Äôs Middle Persian links and entries are attested need to deal with it and those people are far due to the lacking success in the encoding of Book Pahlavi in Unicode; there is also {{cog|fa|⁄Øÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ|tr=gurjƒÅn|t=Georgia}}</small>; however the Arabic form: one also uses much {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿèÿ±Ÿíÿ¨ŸéÿßŸÜ}} and {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ¨ŸéÿßŸÜ}} ‚Äì both are [https://books.google.com/books?id=2y-sC030VqoC&pg=PA79&dq=ÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ+%22ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ%22 given] but you do not need to believe in all equally; here do not confuse with the city of {{w|Gorgan|GurgƒÅn}}¬†in Iran from which {{w|Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani|some personal names and titles of books}} come. It is the source of [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4VLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA818&dq=%22Georgania%22 the] {{cog|ML.|Georgania}}. This is again closer to the ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù form, and, though still the plene spelling of the first vowel and the ''-iyƒÅ'', as well as the considerations about the spread of the country name later in Europe itself from Russian because nobody knew the country, reveal European origin, I wonder what could be the motivation to borrow the country‚Äôs name specifically from English and not for example Italian or Venetian or perhaps even an analogical ''-iyƒÅ'' formation after a Turkish borrowing ‚Äì many country names in Arabic come from Turkish. I mean, {{m|ar|ÿ®ŸèŸÑŸíÿ∫Ÿéÿßÿ±ŸêŸäŸéÿß}}¬†is not from English either, right? What did the Arabs do? They probably artificially glued the ending ''-iyƒÅ'' unto {{m|ar|ÿ®ŸèŸÑŸíÿ∫Ÿéÿßÿ±}}, when Arabs became internationalized and learnt via diplomacy about country names in European languages, considering that such names weren‚Äôt too uncommon before (e.g. {{m|ar|ÿ£ŸéŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜŸêŸäŸéÿß}} is¬†apparently a rather ancient country name, whereas {{m|ar|ŸÜŸêŸÖŸíÿ≥Ÿéÿß}} is already after the pattern) and it was thus convenient.¬†[[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 15:28, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
::::{{re|Fay Freak}} Thanks for the links! I did read ''about'' the variant {{m|ar|ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ}} before (which I ''assume'' to be from Persian and which is formally like the English), but I never actually found an attestation, as all the references I came across, like the one I linked earlier (Ibn al-A·πØƒ´r's story), employ {{m|ar|ŸÉÿ±ÿ¨}} instead. Interestingly, it appears to be another name for the "race", not the region itself, since it shows up in that book in the construction {{m|ar|ÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ|t=the lands of the JarjƒÅn}}, and so an analogous formation with ''-iyƒÅ'' (like that of {{m|ar|ÿ®ŸÑÿ∫ÿßÿ±Ÿäÿß}}) would instead yield {{m|ar|*ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜŸäÿß}}, not {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨Ÿäÿß}}, whence the modern Arabic ethnonym, {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨ŸäŸëŸàŸÜ}}, derives.
::::As you have said, the form {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨Ÿäÿß}} is most likely a European borrowing. I still think that it is directly from English, but I have reworded the etymology to reflect this obscurity you have demonstrated. I also added an entry for {{m|ar|ÿ¨Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ¨ŸéÿßŸÜ}} and referenced it elsewhere. Thanks again!

Hello, Profes.I. May I ask how you know Palaestrator? A new account being pinged by him to give agreement and being rather similar to his own account is normally something that arouses suspicion. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 18:04, 28 November 2017 (UTC)

:{{ping|Metaknowledge}} His contributing here is way older, he had contributed for months (if not longer) under various IPs until he followed my [[User talk:71.102.96.201|recommendation to create an account]] (I posted under the most recent IP). I don‚Äôt know him, I have just pinged him because he appears to know Arabic well (ar-4 according to his user page) and he was around at the time and because he surely does not visit the Tea Room else. He does ‚Äúknow‚Äù me only because I have constantly watched what is happening with the Arabic pages and thus corrected the layout of his edits; he has learnt well. I don‚Äôt know how he is similar other than that he looks how I edit, which is surely justified. See for example the edit history of {{m|ar|ÿ¥ŸÖÿßŸÑ}} ‚Äì do you think that is fake?

I don‚Äôt know what the Arabs are doing all day, but basically this is all I can do: Ask for confirmation by Profes.I and/or Atitarev lest anybody charge me with acting without consensus, what people here too easily do, or do it myself, as there is the principle of [[WT:BOLD|being bold]].

==Welcome and a note==
Hi Profes.I. I just wanted to leave a note about the use of context labels like {{temp|label|ar|zoology}}. This is only intended for terms that are only used in the context of zoology. Names of animals that are regularly used aren't just zoological terms, so they don't need a context label ‚Äî they just need to be categorised at the bottom of the entry.

Additionally, I see that I neglected to give you the welcome message, so here you are! Be sure to ask if you need anything.

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, [[Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers|welcome to Wiktionary]], and thank you for your contributions so far.

If you are unfamiliar with wiki editing, take a look at [[Help:How to edit a page]]. It is a concise list of technical guidelines to the wiki format we use here: how to, for example, make text boldfaced or create [[hyperlink]]s. Feel free to practice in the [[Wiktionary:Sandbox|sandbox]]. If you would like a slower introduction we have a short [[Wiktionary:Tutorial|tutorial]].

These links may help you familiarize yourself with Wiktionary:

* [[Wiktionary:Entry layout|Entry layout]] (EL) is a detailed policy documenting how Wiktionary pages should be formatted. All entries should conform to this standard. The easiest way to start off is to copy the contents of an existing page for a similar word, and then adapt it to fit the entry you are creating.
* Our [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|Criteria for inclusion]] (CFI) define exactly which words can be added to Wiktionary, though it may be a bit technical and longwinded. The most important part is that Wiktionary only accepts words that have been in somewhat widespread use over the course of at least a year, and citations that demonstrate usage can be asked for when there is doubt.
* If you already have some experience with editing our sister project [[w:Main page|Wikipedia]], then you may find our [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians|guide for Wikipedia users]] useful.
* The [[Help:FAQ|FAQ]] aims to answer most of your remaining questions, and there are several [[Help:Contents|help pages]] that you can browse for more information.
* A [[Wiktionary:Glossary|glossary]] of our technical jargon, and some hints for dealing with the more common [[Help:Interacting with humans|communication issues]].
* If you have anything to ask about or suggest, we have several [[Wiktionary:Discussion rooms|discussion rooms]]. Feel free to ask any other editors in person if you have any problems or question, by posting a message on their talk page.

You are encouraged to add a [[WT:Babel|BabelBox]] to your userpage. This shows which languages you know, so other editors know which languages you'll be working on, and what they can ask you for help with.

I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wiktionary:Wiktionarians|Wiktionarian]]! If you have any questions, bring them to the [[Wiktionary:Information desk]], or ask me on my talk page. If you do so, please sign your posts with four tildes: <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> which automatically produces your username and the current date and time.

=={{m|ar|ÿ≠ÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ°}}==
Two things:
# You have added {{m|ar|ÿ¨ŸéŸÖŸéŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸäŸéŸáŸèŸàÿØ}} to {{m|ar|ÿ≠Ÿêÿ±Ÿíÿ®Ÿéÿßÿ°}}. The same day I have removed that definition from {{m|ar|ÿ¨ŸéŸÖŸéŸÑ}} because it [https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1038027 looks like] it means ''mantis''. It is easy to imagine how there could have appeared a myth about it meaning ''chamaleon'' in dictionaries: Somebody read about {{m|ar|ÿ¨ŸéŸÖŸéŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸäŸéŸáŸèŸàÿØ}} being able to hide and having some other characteristics and his first thought has been ‚Äúchameleon‚Äù though ‚Äúmantis‚Äù fits too.
# I have made a template for Georg Freytag‚Äôs ''Lexicon arabico-latinum''. Always use the volume and page number so it links the page: <code><nowiki>{{R:ar:Freytag|page=34|volume=1}}</nowiki></code>. With the first positional parameter the entry name can be overwritten. [[User:Palaestrator verborum|Palaestrator verborum]] ([[User talk:Palaestrator verborum|loquier]]) 22:00, 5 December 2017 (UTC)
## When I was a much younger man I was taught the Jewish Camel was a Chameleon with the explanation of being named for the high arched back of the creature such as in the local [[w:Veiled Chameleon|Veiled Chameleon]]; the appellation Jewish is really more like Judean, being prominent in the regions of Palestine. I have heard the mantis being referred to the same, but this is perhaps correlated from its other Arabic name of being Solomon's Horse; one of the Hebrew names for Chameleon is ◊í÷∞÷º◊û÷∑◊ú ◊©÷∞◊Å◊ú÷π◊û÷π◊î, the camel of Solomon. This typically is derived from a folk tale about Solomon using his sorcery on a stubborn camel of his, transforming it to the insect. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer as Arabs likely utilize both depending on the person, region, and context; it should probably be listed with both significances if we want to be comprehensive.
### Additionally, I noticed the Greek etymology [[œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ]] and its descendants do not mention that it is a calque from the Akkadian nƒì≈° qaqqari literally [https://books.google.com/books?id=-qIuVCsRb98C&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=qaqqari+akkadian&source=bl&ots=BrbfynMRGy&sig=9txrEcoR0S1WCVTPeYqR7NzLgtg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3qae6lfTXAhXhc98KHfv0Ce8Q6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=qaqqari%20akkadian&f=false| Lion of the Ground].
## Thank you for the Freytag template, I'm sure it will be useful down the road; and thank you in general for your input, it has made me a more valuable contributor to Wiktionary. [[User:Profes.I.|Profes.I.]] ([[User talk:Profes.I.|talk]]) 00:58, 6 December 2017 (UTC)

==Some rarer templates I know==

On this occasion I write you this, and also mention {{temp|+obj}}. {{temp|+obj}} has come in handy¬†in {{l|ar|ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ŸÇ}}, the only Arabic entry using it right now (theoretically it should be {{temp|+preo}}, but there are problems with at is as shewn on [[Talk:ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ŸÇ]].

==Made a template for the Dictionary of the Ugaritic Language==
It works like the Lane template: {{temp|R:uga:DUL-3}}. On this occasion, maybe you can find use for the book {{temp|R:sem-pro:FS Militarev}} which is made to print author and essay names just by the page numbers.

== How you can see hidden categories under every entry ==

In your Preferences in the Tab ''Appearance'' there is a checkbox ''Show hidden categories'' whereby you will see categories like ''[[:Category:Akkadian terms needing native script]]''.

Pranams, 
I see you are a professional linguist and been using Wiki for a couple years. I am in no way linguistically adept, but my siksha guru is. I have been trying to find ways to get his important research onto Wiki, but it has been difficult since publishers have no interest in his work. I bet if you look at it you will appreciate it, and might knows ways I can get his insights onto Wiki. 
He shows how deity names and religious terms from various cultures are cognate. I will give you his website, but also one article from there that gives many of his linguistic correlations so you do not have to spend too much time looking through all the articles. If you are on Facebook he has much more info here, on his Saint Francis of Assisi Ecumenical Retreat page and in groups and on certain people‚Äôs pages.

== Cuneiform spellings ==

Hi, professor. I would like to create some Urartian entries, but I am not familiar with cuneiform. If I know the precise transliteration, e.g. <sup>d</sup>≈°i-i-√∫-i-ni ‚Äòthe Urartian Sun God‚Äô, is there an easy way to convert it to Unicode cuneiform? --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 19:37, 10 April 2020 (UTC)
:I have actually considered writing a guide to cuneiform for Wiktionary to help enable others, but creating such a page would be a first for me, my unfamiliarity. If you have a precise transliteration it is for the most part a much easier feat with some modern tools; in the past you would have to find or compile your own charts.
:Steve Tinney of University of Pennsylvania developed [http://cuneifyplus.arch.cam.ac.uk/ Cuneify], which has a few online iterations such as the one linked. It has the vast majority of signs, especially the normal determinatives and core syllable signs. 
:*It also allows for not having to use specialized transliteration symbols; ≈°=sz; ·π£=s,; and ·π≠=t,; instead. 
:*You can use lower-case (for syllables) and/or UPPER-CASE (for logograms); this is not necessary one way or another. Transliteration uses the convention of capitalizing logograms like Sumerian elements, separated by a "." and using lower-case for syllables separated by "-".  
:*Likewise you can use hypens (-), spaces, or full stops to separate the signs, but not new lines/returns. Cuneify will put spaces between each sign, these must be taken out for the form we are looking to post here; a word has no internal spaces, space indicates a following word as with most scripts.
:*For diacritics (subscript numerals) you can type normal numerals, but you can also use accents like your symbol "√∫". That is to say u is u, u2 is √∫, u3 is √π; 1st form is nothing, 2nd variation is a right accent, 3rd variation is a left accent. Further variations use solely number combos, u4 is u4 and u5 is u5 etc. I personally prefer to use subscripts "<sub>2</sub>" and "<sub>3</sub>" when transliterating here at Wiktionary to keep it consistent. 
:*You can type the divine, female, and male determinatives as d-, f- and m-, or as {d}, {f} and {m} (and the other determinatives too). Transliteration practice is to use super-scripts for these elements.
:*Another cool feature, if you type numbers in the decimal system they are converted automatically to base 60.
:Occasionally older sources might list a sign a little differently, or the spelling is utilizing a sign in a not-so-common way and you may have to find a more common name for it or else it will come back with an error.
:*In this case using an extended sign-list and manually having to look it up; here is a handy one compiled by Kate≈ôina ≈†a≈°kov√°, [http://home.zcu.cz/~ksaskova/Sign_List.html Cuneiform Sign List].
:*Search the page, find the sign you are looking for; you can copy it manually or just type the newly found more common name in Cuneify in place of the unknown sign name for the same result.
:If you are having trouble or simply want to move on to adding more entries, you can always leave the cuneiform blank and I will personally go about supplying the script. I do not mind doing so, I check the cuneiform script requests habitually, and especially if there is already a listed transliteration, it is no trouble at all. A good habit for cuneiform users here at Wiktionary is to always supply both transliterations (tr=) and normalized/citation forms (ts=) if one can; it not only allows laymen more access to find what information they were looking for, but also a better way for the information to double checked. 
:There is a reason cuneiform died out so quickly after being so long established; its daunting, it can be messy and mistakes exist abundantly, do not be discouraged. Give it a try for yourself; <sup>d</sup>≈°i-i-√∫-i-ni (alternatively d szi i u2 i ni) should give us this: {{m|xur|íÄ≠íÖÜíÑøíåëíÑøíâå|tr=<sup>d</sup>≈°i-i-u<sub>2</sub>-i-ni|ts=≈†ivini, ≈†iuini, ≈†iwini|t=the Urartian Sun God}}. 
:There are some personal variations found in each language that adopted cuneiform, usually progressing towards simplification and utility for their language needs. I do not want to be that guy who complicates things, but often times there will be other spelling conventions for commonly used words; the only way to learn them is being completely immersed in a cuneiform corpus much in the way the original scribes were. An alternative way attested for writing ≈†iuini in cuneiform is {{m|xur|íÄ≠íåìíâå|tr=<sup>d</sup>UTU-ni|ts=≈†ivini, ≈†iuini, ≈†iwini|t=the Urartian Sun God}}. It uses to Sumerian Signs "DINGIR - god" and "UTU - sun", followed by -ni; adding phonetic compliments to familiar Sumerograms and Akkadograms is one way to shortcut spellings.
:Of possible interest and of aid to you, this source will help you see if a form is directly attested in our known corpus of Urartian inscriptions; [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/ecut/pager/ Electronic Corpus of Urartian Texts] and [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/ecut/hub.html Hub Page] which gives specific set lists of information; [https://www.palaeolexicon.com/Languages Palaeolexicon] also has a Urartian dictionary. Best regards fellow scholar -[[User:Profes.I.|Profes.I.]] ([[User talk:Profes.I.|talk]]) 13:41, 11 April 2020 (UTC)
:: This guide and these tools are exactly what I have been looking for. Thank you very much! --[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahag]] ([[User talk:Vahagn Petrosyan|talk]]) 13:07, 12 April 2020 (UTC)
::: You're quite welcome, I hope it serves you well; Urartian is not my strong suit, but has always peeked curiosity when I've come across it. I did make an error in the above, although it is valid that phonetic compliments are often times added to known logograms, this happens to not be one of those cases. The -ni ending is a Urartian grammatical suffix, the proper alternative spelling would be to use {{m|xur|íÄ≠íåì|tr=<sup>d</sup>UTU|ts=≈†ivini, ≈†iuini, ≈†iwini|t=the Urartian Sun God}} literally meaning Sun God. -[[User:Profes.I.|Profes.I.]] ([[User talk:Profes.I.|talk]]) 01:33, 13 April 2020 (UTC)

== Current French contributors ==

Hello. I'd like to have a clearer picture of the current pool of French contributors; maybe we could unite our efforts and progress in a more systematic way? I've only interacted with {{ping|Jerome Charles Potts}}, {{ping|Adelpine}} and {{ping|Jberkel}}, but I suppose there are others? --[[User:Barytonesis|Barytonesis]] ([[User talk:Barytonesis|talk]]) 15:48, 6 November 2017 (UTC)
: Do you have anything specific in mind? One of the things I wanted to look at is how we can <s>steal</s> reuse some of the amazing data from Wiktionnaire. ‚Äì [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 17:59, 6 November 2017 (UTC)
: Hello. Nowadays I'm collaborating on the English and German Wiktionaries. I'd like to contribute to the French wikis after that (next year).--[[User:Adelpine|Adelpine]] ([[User talk:Adelpine|talk]]) 21:33, 6 November 2017 (UTC)

:{{ping|Jberkel}}: Well, it's still a bit vague, but I'd chiefly like to work on the "depth" of our entries, on consolidating them (by adding synonyms, antonyms, related terms, the whole gamut; by adding labels such as "nonstandard", "proscribed", "rare" whenever necessary)
:I'm not particularly interested in creating tons of new entries. Well, that depends; I have a fondness for obsolete words like {{m|fr|moise}} that are inherited from Latin, and I think we're still missing a lot of common multiword expressions; but although it would be nice to blue everything in [[Wiktionary:Requested_entries_(French)/t]] (for example), there are a lot of uninteresting words in there.
* Become a good translation dictionary, especially for slang terms ([[foutu]]), idioms ([[faire le malin]]), etc.
* Make a more systematic use of categories, topical as well as grammatical
* Present reflexive/pronominal verbs in a systematic way 
* Complete [[:Category:French verbs taking √™tre as auxiliary]] (I see you want to do the same for Italian)
* Categorise compounds such as [[ouvre-bo√Æte]], [[casse-noisette]], etc. (cf. [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour#Category:Subtypes_of_compounds_by_language|this discussion]]); and take the opportunity to mention systematically the pre-1990 spelling if we only have the post-1990 one, and conversely
* work on [[:Category:French conjunctions]], [[:Category:French prepositions]], create [[:Category:French conjunctive adverbs]] (cf. [[:Category:English conjunctive adverbs]]; there are many interesting categories in [[:Category:English adverbs]], [[actually]])
* use [[:fr:Cat√©gorie:Termes vulgaires en fran√ßais]] to complete [[:Category:French vulgarities]]
* maybe create [[Appendix:French doublets]] (we already have [[:Category:French doublets]], but a table might be clearer)
Maintenance: 
* empty [[:Category:etyl cleanup/fr]]
* empty [[:Category:French idioms]], which doesn't add any value
* split [[:Category:French words suffixed with -ment]] (cf. [[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#Category:French_words_suffixed_with_-ment|this]])
* I've also found this [https://www.jstor.org/stable/316992?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents list of French similes]; I created the ones I knew, but there are still a fair amount of them (quotations would be good, though, because a lot of them I've never even read)
: What about you? What would you like to reuse from fr.wikt? --[[User:Barytonesis|Barytonesis]] ([[User talk:Barytonesis|talk]]) 16:04, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
:: Agreed on the "depth" aspect, I'm also interested in slang terms ‚Äì there are so many in French. I initially wasn't interested in categories but now find them to be valuable, especially "sizeable" categories listing grammatical oddities. What's the problem with [[:Category:French idioms]]? As a learner I find it useful.
:: I'm also interested in adding synonyms and usage examples. Maybe that's something we could take from Wiktionnaire. However they seem to mostly use citations which are often quite wordy and not necessarily the best illustration for a word.
:: Other things I'd like to focus on are verbs in general: adding transitive/intransitive labels, and use standardized annotations for prepositions. For example {{temp|indtr}} which I've often used in Portuguese entries.
:: I noticed that you've started revising [[Wiktionary:About French]], which is great, it's a bit rudimentary at the moment. ‚Äì [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 17:34, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
:::{{reply|Jberkel}} " I initially wasn't interested in categories but now find them to be valuable, especially "sizeable" categories listing grammatical oddities" > so we should get along quite well :p
::*''Re'' [[:CAT:French idioms]]: firstly, it's redundant in itself: if a word weren't idiomatic, we wouldn't have an entry for it. Secondly, I think putting things there is the lazy man's way of saying "this is an interesting word, but I won't bother to tell you why/how". So you've got [[similes]], [[proverbs]], and all kinds of parts of speech all bundled together. It does bother me, however, that an entry like {{m|fr|faire les courses}} isn't categorised in anything else than [[:CAT:French verbs]]. But as I said, I don't think [[:CAT:French idioms]] is a good solution.
::* ''Re'' transitivity and use of prepositions: I wholeheartedly agree! I didn't know about {{temp|indtr}} at all, I've just been using {{temp|lb}}, but it has always seemed messy to me to mix grammatical, topical and register labels together... 
::* I also use {{temp|lb}} to give info about the preposition, but there it's not only messy, it's even ugly (look at the last sense of {{m|fr|d√©faire}}...). There's {{temp|+preo}} which I've seen used on a few AGr. entries, but it's been lying in an experimental state for three years so I'm a bit reluctant to use it. It could be interesting as well to have verbs categorised by the preposition they require, actually.
::* ''Re'' synonyms: yes. When I add them, I often feel like I'm wasting my time doing a job that's already been done. Among other things, maybe we could start using links to entries of the [[:fr:Th√©saurus]] to avoid reduplication of content. As I've said elsewhere, I don't think we should start creating French thesaurus entries on en.wikt as it's, IMO, outside of scope.
::* Another minor problem that I'd like to settle is how we should handle different lemmatizations between fr.wikt and en.wikt. I think we should be quite strict on our way of lemmatisation, and I often don't agree with the way it's done on fr.wikt. When I created {{m|fr|faire une croix sur}}, I was very tempted to put it at {{m|fr|faire une croix}} instead, but at the same time I didn't want the [[:fr:faire une croix sur|French entry]] to be hidden from view. --[[User:Barytonesis|Barytonesis]] ([[User talk:Barytonesis|talk]]) 10:12, 8 November 2017 (UTC)
:::: Re idiomatic, I see you point, but the information is often not obvious to somebody learning the language (is it just a weird, rare, literary turn of phrase, or commonly understood?) It might be lazy, but still better than no information at all. Maybe it could first be tagged as "idiomatic" and later be bucketed in a more detailed category.
:::: About the synonyms, linking to fr.wikt might be a good idea. I think for a given sense it's often good enough to have one or two really strong synonyms inline. As you get more proficient in the language you can then just look at the synonyms, skipping the English definition altogether.
:::: About the lemmatizations, I haven't really thought about it. Do they have guidelines on fr.wikt? i.e. always include prepositions, is it consistent? Maybe redirects could be a solution, if they  are used for cross-wiki links. ‚Äì [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] ([[User talk:Jberkel|talk]]) 10:50, 8 November 2017 (UTC)
:::::{{reply|Jberkel}} Frohes neues Jahr! I've changed my mind about [[:CAT:French idioms]], which I think ''is'' useful (it's still be good to split it by POS, though); I'm only opposed to {{temp|lb|idiomatic}}. --[[User:Per utramque cavernam|Per utramque cavernam]] ([[User talk:Per utramque cavernam|talk]]) 23:57, 8 January 2018 (UTC)

:::I agree,  π is too hard to type for such a small distinction. Using ' and " does not result in any confusion.

True, but there are cases when one wants to say something like the following: Gogol''''s writings, where there should be two ' symbols; the first ' is conceived of as a soft sign and the second as an English apostrophe. It looks weird and is likely to confuse anybody who doesn't immediately get it. (For some reason, the Wikipedia editor won't let me type two consecutive apostrophes, so I can't get this comment to display the way I intend, with two instead of one.

:But this is a dictionary. We do not host the Russian Classics in transliteration, we just have entries for each separate word or phrase, and entries such as those do not have apostrophes.

== Strange romanization rules. ==

This looks like a mess of transliteration and transcription. If the goal is transliteration - that's just script substitution, letter by letter. So it's gonna be ''po≈æ√°lujsta''. If we need transcription - we should spell phonemically and that's ''pa≈æ√°lusta''. So where does ''po≈æ√°lusta'' fit?
As to the current rules:
* e, —ë have two spellings with j and without. Why not —é, —è? They are all equal in that sense, i.e. pronounced with or without j. In fact there's rule for —è in reflexive verbs, but why only in that place? –ü—è—Ç—å is certainly not pronounced pjat', but p'at'.
* e, —ç use the same letter. But they're pronounced differently, albeit not always. 
So, for vowels I think we should use.
e = e / je
—ë = 'o (not o!, but with exceptions) / jo
—ç = e / (maybe √¶?)
—é = 'u / ju
—è = 'a / ja
Exceptions for —ë are all right, though after —á, I would prefer to keep 'o. So (—á—ë—Ä—Ç = ƒç'ort, not ƒçort), unless you wish to sound Cossack-like.
G/h substitution - not good example. I wouldn't imagine pronouncing ''–≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∏'' like ''h√≥spodi''. 
Unless affecting Ukrainian accent that is. Classic example is –ª—ë–≥–∫–∏–π = l'ohkij.
Anyway, if we use g/h and g/v substitution, why not others? That would be –∫–æ–¥ = kot (=–∫–æ—Ç), etc. and that way we'll just have phonemical transcription which defeats the whole idea of transliteraton. (more below).
–†–µ–∑—é–º–µ is not good either. First, it should be res'um...  not resjum... (It's not —Ä–µ–∑—å—é–º–µ, right? But according to current rules it is.) Second, it's mostly prounounced res'ume, with soft m. While hard m might be acceptable (which I'm not sure of), –∫–∞—Ñ–µ or –∫–∞—Ä–µ would be better example. But if we use …õ for e sounding like —ç, we certainly should use it for —ç itself, shouldn't we? By the way, …õ is just a square for me 'cause I don't have no Arial Unicode installed. Like many other users. And that makes me think, what is transliteration really for? I guess it's for making some representation of the word to users who do not know the ''script'' or simply can't see it. This should be readable (albeit not exactly correct phonetically) by anyone who knows just Latin alphabet. What's the point of writing …õ instead of —ç? Is …õ ''romanization''? It's not Latin alphabet. We might just as well give full IPA and not bother with rules here. By the way, current policy specifically forbids giving pronunciation in translations (and that's where transliteration is mostly used). I think transliteration must enable any user to easily identify and distinguish different ''printed'' words in unfamiliar script. Phonemical transcription doesn't allow that. And even if it is used, it must be at least applied consistently.
Now, this is very important matter, so I'm not changing anything myself, but I'd like to see some feedback. --[[User:Panda34|Panda34]] 20:07, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

:It‚Äôs transliteration (i.e., ''po'', not ''pa''), but with enough flexibility to note exceptions to pronunciation. Normally, [[–ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞]] would be pronounced "p å í√°lujst…ô" and would be transliterated "po≈æ√°lujsta", but this word is a notable exception for its irregular pronunciation. Therefore, the parts that are dropped in pronunciation are dropped from the transliteration: ''po≈æ√°lsta or po≈æ√°lusta''. There are not many cases like this, but each case must be done so that an American who is not a linguist will be able to see best how to say it. This is not for linguists or Russians, which they use the Cyrillic. Another example is [[–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ã—á]], which is pronounced irregularly as "Iv√°nyƒç".
:I know what you are talking about with [[–ø—è—Ç—å]] = "p'at'", but only linguists and native Russians will comprehend that. The best that 99% of Americans and British can do is "pjat". If you write "p'at'", most people will pronounce it "pat". To learn the really differences between "–ø—è" and "–ø—å—è" takes most English-speakers years, and even then only a handful ever get it. That's why —è, —ë and —é and always written ja, jo, ju (except after ch, etc., where spelling it "chjo" would result is a serious mispronunciation). You have to take into consideration the audience, few of whom will ever figure out palatalized consonants, and few of whom will even see the importance. As for the Russian letter [[–µ]], it is too common, and transliterating it as 'e everytime looks terrible and helps no one. Linguists and native Russians read the Cyrillic. The only people who need the transliteration are those who don‚Äôt get palatalization anyway. It is general practice among most who transliterate Russian to English to transliterate Russian [[–µ]] as "e", and serious users know that the English "e" following a consonant is to be pronounced approximately as "je". Only when Russian [[–µ]] comes at the beginning of a word or follows a vowel does it get transliterated as "je". Initial "e" is used for Russian [[—ç]]. Also, in some words where Russian [[–µ]] is pronounced [[—ç]], then we transliterated it with {{IPAchar|…õ}}. This means that in transliteration, Roman "e" is treated exactly as Cyrillic [[–µ]], and it is considered that it palatalizes a preceding consonant, without having to put in the mysterious-looking '.
:–∞ = a, —è = ja
:—ç = e, –µ = e (sometimes {{IPAchar|…õ}})
:—ã = y, –∏ = i
:–æ = o, —ë = jo
:—É = u, —é = ju
:except, of course, after —á, —à, etc., since writing '''ƒço ≈°o''' allows an American to come as close as he can to the correct pronunciation, while writing '''ƒçjo ≈°jo''' would result is a very bad error. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 21:28, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

::First, if you read carefully I never proposed e = 'e (and for exactly the same reason you provided). I agree about ja 'a. Anyway, it's not what I propose; I'm totally against any phonemic transcription whatsoever. I just pointed inconsistencies in the current system. And, by the way it's –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á, not ...—ã—á. And officially it's pronounced exactly ivanovich. It's perfectly normal to say ''ivanovich'' in informal speech. But saying ''ivanych'' in officialese while not an error makes you look a little on 'hillbilly' side. And that's my whole point.  Transliteration gives you an idea how the word is printed, transcription how it's pronounced. This mix only makes confusion. Those who see cyrillic for the first time in their life won't be much better off in pronouncing 'tovo' instead of 'togo'. Listening to heavy foreign accent, I would prefer 'togo' because it can be reverse-engineered (and it doesn't sound wrong, just Northern dialect). But suppose this person finally learns the letters (and I suppose it's fairly easy). What then he'll write? –¢–æ–≤–æ? And then he'll find —Ç–æ–≥–æ outside of the dictionary, he won't even know what it is! The same is for spoken language. If you read it as 'tovo' you'll expect to hear it as 'tovo' but you'll hear 'tavo'. And when spelling something by syllables to somebody who has a problem hearing or understanding you, words are mostly pronounced orthographically. So, you see, it's printed 'togo' pronounced 'tavo' but transliterated 'tovo'. Russian orthography is muddled enough by itself without us inventing some third form.
::Your point is that transliteration is used to give some idea of how the word is pronounced. Why don't we transliterate French then? My point is that if some non-linguist wants to ''pronounce'' something he would be much better off to look at IPA, SAMPA, at least he'll have a chance to get it right. Transliteration is not for pronouncing but for representing ''printed'' words in another script. Russians have to use translit very often in non-Cyrillic-enabled environment, and don't type 'tovo' unless affecting padonki-style. Why should Americans? Consider google hits for "kogo nibud" and "kovo nibud". ''Two'' orders of magnitude. The latter form is either unintelligible or illiterate. By providing half-phonemic transcription we don‚Äôt help pronunciation much but certainly mangle orthography. Transliteration should be used only in print. And another concern is a rather arbitrary choice of exceptions. In my native ear –ª—ë–≥–∫–∏–π pronounced orthographically sounds like 'too correct' pronunciation which is perfectly comprehensible, while e.g. vtoroj (if you could actually pronounce it) instead of ftaroj is a heavy foreign accent to the point of unintelligibility.
::Also note that transliteration may be official. Geography, personal names, etc. Consider 'park gor'kovo' and 'park gor'kogo'. Check google hits. And those are English sites.

:::I agree that both transcriptions, "Ivanovich" and "Ivanych", should be provided, but "Ivanych" should not be left out, since it is a systematic alteration that applies to virtually all male and female patronymics, and something that the orthogram spelling does not reveal. There are many features and forms in Russian that strike a native speaker as provincial or hillbilly, but which nevertheless are deepseated and something that every Russian knows, even though most people avoid using them except in certain circumstances. It may be good to include a note that a foreigner should stick with "Ivanovich", but the pronunciation "Ivanych" still needs to be shown.
:::As for the use of transcriptions, they are only for the casual user who does not speak any Russian, cannot read Cyrillic, and is not interested in learning. Unlike Arabic, Indic and the Oriental scripts, Cyrillic can be learnt in only about 30 minutes, and anyone who wants to learn Russian will learn Cyrillic in the first lesson.
:::Anybody who has to rely on the transcription will be someone who does not speak Russian and you will not be hearing him say "tov√≥" to you. You can‚Äôt look up individual words in a dictionary, one after the other, and manage to pronounce a coherent question and receive and decipher a useful reply. A transcription is only good for someone who is not a linguist, does not speak the language, does not care to learn the language or the writing, but who only wants to know in an approximate way how a certain word or two is pronounced. Certainly a transcription is NOT intended as an alternative medium for native speakers. Everyone who speaks Russian, including Americans who have studied Russian for only a month in school, will use the Cyrillic which is supplied with every Russian word and phrase.
:::When someone starts to learn Russian, the first hour he learns the printed alphabet and the script alphabet. During the first week, the genitive singular case in introduced, and it is made instantly clear how [[-–æ–≥–æ]] is to be pronounced. Nobody who learns "tov√≥" is ever going to go and say "√©to vavn√≥". No one who cannot read Cyrillic and who does not know the pronunciations of [[–≥]] is going to have a conversation with you in Russian. Transliteration does not lead to confusion, because it is only used by those who know almost nothing about the language who who do not much care. In a very few instances, the transliteration can help a serious student to learn about a quirk in pronunciation such as "Ivanych".
:::We also use the transliteration to help indicate where the stess is. It would be much better to show the stress by putting the acute accent mark, but that is somewhat problematic. For one, the acute accent is hard to type. It is not on any keyboard that I have access to and I have to copy and paste it. For two, it looks bad in most fonts used by Westerners (–≥—Ä–∞ÃÅ–º–º–∞), unless you apply the template <nowiki>{{Cyrl|}}</nowiki>: {{lang|ru|–≥—Ä–∞ÃÅ–º–º–∞}}. And third, it confuses some search engines. If you search for "–≥—Ä–∞ÃÅ–º–º–∞", you will not find "[[–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞]]" (and vice versa).
:::You will not be pronouncing syllables orthographically to someone who does not know Cyrillic. To communicate with an American who does not know Cyrillic, you have to speak English. If he asks you how to say a certain word in Russian, such as "give me a beer", it really doesn‚Äôt matter whether you pronounce it naturally or othographically, since he almost certainly will not learn it and will not use it. If he does try to use it once, he will be bet with blank stares or a complex sentence in Russian which he won‚Äôt understand, so he won‚Äôt use it a second time. You are attaching entirely too much importance to the transliterations. They are only for people who do not know anything of the language and who are not likely to ever learn more (that is, most people). They are for people who have a passing interest in only a word or two, and the transliterations have an additional use, for '''serious''' users, as a way to inform them of unexpected quirks in the pronunciation of some words, such as "pozhalsta". (And the varying pronunciations of Cyrillic [[–∞]] and [[–æ]] are learnt along with the alphabet in the very first hour of study, so the important thing is not the o‚Äôs and a‚Äôs, but the dropped -uj-.)
:::We transliterate Cyrillic because many Americans believe it is a gigantic barrier. It only takes a half hour to learn it, but many Americans complain bitterly about Russian-English dictionaries because they don‚Äôt have transliterations. It‚Äôs very silly but it‚Äôs a fact of life. In the case of French, German, Spanish and Italian, nobody much cares about how the word is supposed to be pronounced. Since they are written in the Roman alphabet, people pronounce them as they wish and the foreigner is expected to understand. If an American says "–¥–∂–∞" to a German (ja) and the German does‚Äôt understand, he thinks he is mentally retarded. But Cyrillic is seen as a fantastic and insurmountable barrier.
:::As for IPA and SAMPA, most people cannot decipher either of those. Most of us learn a way that approximately describes English pronunciation in dictionaries as we grow up, but that is neither IPA nor SAMPA. IPA and SAMPA are tools of linguists.
:::As for Russians reading and writing Russian in Roman script, obviously they are going to write "togo" and "Ivanovich" (or "Iwanovic"). Our transliterations are not, I repeat not, for native Russians. They are for people who cannot read Cyrillic and who don‚Äôt know Russian and who are almost certainly never going to learn (that is, most people).
:::Very few people who cannot read Cyrillic can pronounce "vtor√≥j" at all, nor "ftor√≥j". They will add a neutral vowel, or worse. I remember a student sweating over the pronunciation of [[–≤—Å—ë]], and the best he could do after much practice was "—Å—Ñ—ë". "Vtor√≥j" is not intended for any serious students of Russian. Another thing learnt in the first day of study is how [[–≤]] before [[—Å]] is devoiced. The student still expects to see it transcribed as "vs", and "fs" is only for an IPA representation, which virtually nobody uses.
:::Yes, there are several official transliterations. The U.S. military uses one, which is the first one that I learned; our libraries uses another, which is a common one. The U.S. Geological Service uses another one, which is quite common. The transcriptions that we use here are not intended to be any of the official ones, but are very close to them, yet with the flexibility to indicate exceptions in pronunciation. I don‚Äôt think there is much need to give ANY of the official transliterations, but for certain words, such as "Gor‚Äôkij park", if you wanted to include one or more official transliterations, you would need to indicate which: Scholarly, ISO/R 9:1968, ISO 9:1995, GOST, U.N., ALA-LC, or the BGN/PCGN (United States Board on Geographic Names). For a while, we did try to include some of these, such as GOST and BGN/PCGN, but people objected to every header that we could think of, so we stopped that effort.
:::The main thing to remember is that the transcriptions are not intended for native Russians or for linguists and for anyone who speaks Russian. They are for the average native English-speaker, who is a person who cannot read Cyrillic, cannot speak Russian, and is never going to learn. In addition, the transcriptions show unexpected exceptions to pronunciation, which is important to serious students of Russian. And lastly, and unfortunately, the transcriptions are a way to show the word stress for the citation form (as I explained above). [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 16:33, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
::::Ah, I got you now. What we have here for transliteration is a sort of curiosity for idle readers and occasionally a good help for learners to learn immediately of exceptional pronunciation. ''Makes sense.'' What I had in mind was helping people have ''written'' conversation in Russian via e-mail or IM. Like, you know, most common request for translation "how do I write 'I love you' in Russian using English letters". On second thought I see that it's just the same idle curiosity, anyone mildly interested in writing Russian could easily learn Cyrillic and then figure out how to transliterate it ''properly'' if need be. It's just that it's called ''transliteration'' that confused me in the first place, ''it is not''. But it is more useful than transliteration, you convinced me. [[User:Panda34|Panda34]] 20:19, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

The romanization section here contradicts [[Appendix:Russian transliteration]].  That guideline is based on the widely accepted transliteration system used in linguistics, while this one seems to be based on the whims of a bunch of Wiktionary editors'.

Scientific transliteration seems to be appropriate for a dictionary (although it's a bad choice as the basis for a system meant to convey pronunciation to English-language readers).  Other standardized systems have their advantages too, but there's no justification for making stuff up because we like it.

Pronunciation is already conveyed by IPA, as covered by the [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation]] guideline.  If someone would like to supplement the IPA pronunciation with some other standardized phonemic or phonetic system, as is done for many English words, that would be fine.  This belongs in the "pronunciation" section of an entry, not next to the headword and not in a "translations" section.  This is where syllabification, stress, and akanye are also represented.

(By the way, spoken stress is an attribute of pronunciation, and is also represented in IPA.  In Cyrillic dictionaries it is represented by accents on the headwords because these are more-or-less phonemic writing systems, but English dictionaries have separate pronunciation guides.  Acute accents for stress are a foreign convention to English-language readers, and do not belong in English-language Wiktionary. [''Hyphenation'' is an attribute of orthography represented in the headwords of English dictionaries, but ''syllabification'' is a separate attribute of pronunciation.  see [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation#Hyphenation]]])

The purpose of romanization here is to convey the original ''orthography'' to English readers.  We list headwords in English, not in IPA.  The main headword for [[his]] is not [[h…™z]] or [[hƒ≠z]].  For the same reasons, the main Latin-alphabet representation of the written word [[–µ–≥–æ]] in Russian should be ''jego'' (depending on the system), and certainly not jev√≥, yevo, ievo or j…™Ààvo.

Wiktionary's transliteration guide does not clearly convey these principals.  If we can agree what they are, then it will be clearer what to do here.  I've started a discussion at [[Wiktionary talk:Transliteration#Purpose]]. ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 00:05, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:: ''Acute accents for stress are a foreign convention to English-language readers, and do not belong in English-language Wiktionary.'' - This kind of argumentation is flawed. Why shouldn't common Slavistics practice for indicating stress/pitch accent be used for ''foreign'' language lexemes on English wiktionary? This is English wiktionary, but the words are not English only. Putting it in transliteration for languages written in Cyrillic script is a good way to get rid of combining diacritics. --[[User:Ivan ≈†tambuk|Ivan ≈†tambuk]] 00:18, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

::: Well, stress is an attribute of pronunciation, not orthography, and it is already indicated in the pronunciation section here (which is normally absent in Cyrillic dictionaries).  We have two separate things: transliterations and pronunciation, and it could be confusing to unnecessarily mix there functions.  Since this a dictionary for English readers, but of words in all languages, we should stick to the basic English conventions, and not add exceptions for particular languages or writing systems where possible.

::: The argument of using common slavistics conventions does carry weight, however.  But are accents commonly added to transliterations in English-language slavistics publications, or are they only used on the Cyrillic in dictionaries?  I don't have a lot of paper references at hand. ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 01:23, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

:::: I just had a look through the Ukrainian language and writing articles in my copy of ''Ukraine: a Concise Encyclop√¶dia'' (1963), and indeed, I see that accents are used to indicate stress with scientific transliteration.  This appears to be used both in transcription of spoken words and transliteration of written words, although the distinction isn't always clear to me.  So there is some literature supporting this practice. 

:::: Note that this my still not be suitable for use with certain transliteration systems for some languages which use diacritics over vowels. ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 01:43, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

::::: Well, the Russian dictionaries that permit some kind of preview on [http://books.google.com/books?q=russian+dictionary&btnG=Search+Books b.g.c.] all appear to use diacritics on Cyrillic letters. I never really paid attention to transliterated Russian words whether they use accent marks or not, but I'm pretty sure that when it's used on various vowels, it was used to indicate stress. For what it's worth, Derksen's [http://www.ieed.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&morpho=0&basename=\data\ie\slav&first=1&sort=protoslav&on_ru=on Slavic inherited lexicon] (online version of a printed book) and Kortlandt's book on [http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/sa/ Slavic accentuation] indicate the stress on transliterations via diacritics, although Stang's classical book "Slavonic accentuation" uses them on Russian Cyrillic letters. So stress marks appear to be used when they are important to note, whatever writing scheme (transliteration or original orthography) author choses to use.
::::: Languages with relatively decent phoneme-to-grapheme ratio rarely need tools such as IPA. Indicating stress is sometimes of utmost importance (for example, in some South Slavic languages some of which are written in Cyrillic too, where e.g. 'novina' can mean 4 different things depending on how you pronounce it). The whole idea of =Pronunciation= section here on wiktionary is ill-suited for highly-inflective languages in which stress/pitch accent is not part of standard orthography (unlike e.g. polytonic Greek), but is very important in practice, especially it's mobility in various cases. =Pronunciation= section idea is based on a fact that the knowledge on how to pronounce a lemma form would be enough. There's no way in entries such as {{l|ru|–æ–Ω}} or {{l|sh|on}} but to indicate it using common stress markers inside the declension tables.
::::: Be it inside the headword on Cyrillic letters, or in transliterations, accent marks are pretty important. Bear in mind, however, that thousands of Russian entries here already mark stress in transliterations, and doing that is much easier than figuring out how does one put acute on "—é". --[[User:Ivan ≈†tambuk|Ivan ≈†tambuk]] 10:15, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

:::::::: The only complaints I encounter are due to the lack of the accent in the Cyrillic. People who can read the Cyrillic are bothered by the need to look to the transcription to see the stress. The only reason that I haven‚Äôt been putting the acute in all the Cyrillic headwords is the difficulty of inserting it. It is not on any of my keyboards, and the only way I can do it is to copy and paste. A second problem is how the it appears in Cyrillic text. On some systems, it looks fine (depending on the fonts installed and probably also the browser)...but on many systems the acute accent rides very high and off to the right. This is how it looks on my screen (using Firefox and WinXP Pro), and it really looks unprofessional. It can be fixed on some systems (hopefully almost all systems) by using the template <nowiki>{{Cyrl|...}}</nowiki>, but this adds more work to creating the entries. If the acute were easier to type, I think it would be best to use it everywhere except in the PAGENAME.

:Big discussion, I haven't read everything, will reread again but my position is to show the rare exceptions as they are pronounced. It really doesn't make much difference, Russian is phonetic in 99% of cases, but providing the information on exceptions and the word stress is useful. BTW both –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á and –ò–≤–∞–Ω—ã—á exist, the former being more standard and more commonly used in writing, especially documents but Iv√°nyƒç is more colloquial and sometimes has a friendlier sound. There is no confusion here - there are two forms.

:I'll try to list some exceptions:
* [[–≥]] (g) as /v/: -–µ–≥–æ/-–æ–≥–æ (-(j)evo/-ovo ) in genitive/accusative of adjectives, some nouns and pronouns: {{l|ru|–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π|–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–æ–≥–æ|tr=kras√≠vovo}} (''genitive m and n or accusative of animate m''), including the word {{l|ru|—Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è|tr=sev√≥dnja}}. The word {{l|ru|–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ|tr=mn√≥go}} is pronounced as expected.
* [[—á]] (ƒç) as i some words/ Ç/: {{l|ru|—á—Ç–æ|tr=≈°to}}, {{l|ru|—á—Ç–æ–±—ã|tr=≈°toby}}, {{l|ru|–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ|tr=kon√©≈°no}}, etc.
* [[–≥]] (g) as /…¶/ or /x/ (in devoiced positions). Interjections have dual pronunciations: {{l|ru|–∞–≥–∞|tr=ah√°, ag√°}}, {{l|ru|–æ–≥–æ|tr=oh√≥, og√≥}}, {{l|ru|—É–≥—É|tr=uh√∫, ug√∫}}, {{l|ru|–≥–∞–≤-–≥–∞–≤|tr=gav-gav, hav-h√°v}}. {{l|ru|–±–æ–≥|tr=box}} (in nominative), {{l|ru|–ª—ë–≥–∫–∏–π|tr=lj√≥xkij}}, {{l|ru|–º—è–≥–∫–∏–π|tr=mj√°xkij}}
* [[–µ]] (je) may NOT palatalise consonants in some loanwords. This is complicated, since knowing that a word is a loanword doesn't mean that it should not be palatalised, e.g. in {{l|ru|–≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–Ω|tr=veter√°n}}, {{l|ru|—Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞|tr=temperat√∫ra}}, {{l|ru|–∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç|tr=contin√©nt}} consonants are palatalised in front of [[–µ]] but in {{l|ru|–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç|tr=int…õrn…õÃÅt}}, {{l|ru|—Ç–µ–º–ø|tr=t…õmp}}, {{l|ru|–¥–µ–ø–æ|tr=d…õp√≥}}, the consonants are NOT palatalised.
* There is a number of words where consonants are silent in clusters: {{l|ru|—Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤—ã–π|tr=≈°ƒçasl√≠vyj}}, {{l|ru|—Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ|tr=s√≥nce}},  {{l|ru|—á–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π|tr=ƒç√©snyj}}, etc.
* The word {{l|ru|–ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞|tr=po≈æ√°lusta, po≈æ√°lsta}} - [[–π]] is always silent. The former is more common and standard but the latter is used in Moscow region. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] 11:31, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

:Other exceptions, which are not worth any change in transliteration because of consistency:
* [[–æ]] (o) is reduced (close to "a") in an unaccented position but is still romanised as "o": {{l|ru|–º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ|tr=molok√≥}}, {{l|ru|–∫–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞|tr=kor√≥va}}
* Endings -—Ç—å—Å—è/-—Ç—Å—è are consistently pronounced as /ts…ô/ but we still romanise -t'sja/-tsja {{l|ru|—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å—Å—è|tr=rod√≠t'sja}}.

== How do we name this case? ==

—Ç—Ä–∏ —á–∞—Å'–∞? –≤ –¥–≤–∞ —Ä—è–¥'–∞?
Some call it —Å—á—ë—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂ in Russian, what is appropriate term in English if any? Do we need to bother at all or should be happy with just special case of genitive? And for —á–∞—Å it's not even there.

:I don‚Äôt think it is ever considered as a different case in English. We just look at it as an irregularity in the genitive case. If there were numerous words, a case name would be helpful, but there are only a few that I can think of. There are many more in what may be called the partitive-genitive case, and of course some in the vocative and some in the locative (as opposed to the prepositional). I have fixed [[—á–∞—Å]], it was overlooked before. There might be a better way to do it. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 15:07, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

== Romanization critique ==

My observations on the problems and differences between the transliteration chart at [[Appendix:Russian transliteration]] and [[Wiktionary:About Russian#Romanization]].  I am assuming that both of these are based on the scholarly linguists' system of [[w:scientific transliteration]].  

The contradictions and pell-mell changes introduce inconsistencies from any accepted standard, add ambiguities in transcription, and make the system much more complicated to write and to read.  They yield a "transliteration" which is neither a rendering of the original orthography nor a phonetic transcription, and the phonetic elements are a mix of central European and English-language equivalents.  The other simple chart has some problems, but the method here is a complete mess, mixing elements of scientific transliteration, GOST transliteration, BGN/PCGN transliteration, made-up rules, and even IPA phonetic transcription.

Easily resolvable problems:
* The simple chart transliterates Cyrillic —Ö as Latin x, while this method offers "x, kh" (both versions are found in different references for scientific transliteration, but there's no reason to recommend two different options).  The original system uses only "x".
* The simple chart offers neutral double quotation marks for the hard sign, while both charts offer typographic (curly) quotation marks for the other soft and hard signs (an obvious mistake, which I'll correct shortly ['''[http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Russian_transliteration&diff=3890867&oldid=3247100 done]''' ‚ÄîMZ])

Arbitrary additions, exceptions, and borrowings
* Both charts transliterate Cyrillic —Ü as "ts", instead of the original "c".
* Both charts transliterate Cyrillic —ë in two ways: "jo, o", instead of the original "√´".
* Both charts transliterate Cyrillic –µ in two ways: "je, e", instead of the original "e", with the simple one lacking an explanatory note.
* Both charts transliterate Cyrillic —ç as "e", instead of the original "√®".
* This method adds adds a list of mostly arbitrary phonetic rules under the heading "Additional considerations"
* This method also adds the Cyrillic dictionary convention of using an acute accent for syllabic stress, which is problematic for several reasons.  In English dictionaries stress and syllabification (not hyphenation) are normally indicated in the pronunciation, not in the headword.  The use of acute accents this way is unfamiliar to English-language readers, and can be mistaken for normal orthography on Cyrillic characters (cf. [[w:Gje|–É]], [[w:Ye with grave|–Ä]], [[w:Short I|–ô]], [[w:I with grave (Cyrillic)|–ç]], [[w:Kje|–å]], [[w:Short U|–é]]), and for pronunciation (as in ''caf√©'', etc.) or letter differentiation on Latin characters (several Romanization systems use diacritics to represent different Cyrillic letters).

If this is a guide to pronunciation, then it belongs ''only'' in the "pronunciation" section of a page, as a supplement to IPA.  If it is a true transliteration representing the written word, then it belongs next to the headword or in the "translations" section.  If this chart is a work in progress, it belongs on a talk page, and not presented without comment on the main page about Russian in Wiktionary.

My recommendations:
# '''This chart should be immediately removed''' from the guideline page, because it is contradictory and seriously flawed.
# For '''orthographic transliteration''', a standardized method for [[w:romanization of Russian]] should be chosen to be used next to Cyrillic in headwords and "transliteration" sections.  This should replace [[Appendix:Russian transliteration]].  
## The linguists' method of '''[[w:Scientific transliteration|scientific transliteration]]''' is appropriate for a dictionary, and could gracefully replace the current practice.
## A bibliographic system for English, like [[w:ALA-LC romanization for Russian|ALA-LC]] or [[w:BGN/PCGN romanization of Russian|BGN/PCGN]] would be a suitable alternate.
## GOST or ISO 9 may also be suitable, but these are rarely used and unfamiliar.
# For '''phonetic transcription''', a standardized method could also be chosen for use as a complement to IPA in "pronunciation" sections.  The only thing I've seen in literature is a phonemic transcription using the same conventions as scientific transliteration.  Perhaps there is also a suitable convention based on older English-language dictionaries.  See [[w:Pronunciation respelling for English]] for an outline of 16 systems, and [[w:Pronunciation spelling]].  Oxford dictionaries used to have a selection of symbols for some foreign sounds, but apparently none for Slavic languages, e.g. indicating palatalization.[[w:Talk:Pronunciation_respelling_for_English#OED|[*]]]
# '''Syllabic stress''' should not be indicated using acute accents.  Stress should only be indicated in "pronunciation" sections according to English dictionary conventions.  Possible conventions come from IPA ({{IPAchar|/j…™Ààvo/}}) or from older English-language dictionaries (jƒ≠¬∑vo π). [update: as discussed above, there is precedent for using accents in scholarly transliteration or transcription in slavistics ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 01:57, 8 March 2008 (UTC)]
# We should '''avoid inventing new methods''', unless we can prove that we are more qualified than the scores of linguists, librarians, academics, and publishers who use established standards.  If standards can't solve every romanization/transcription problem, then let's at least try to follow a published example.

: ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 23:35, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:::The difference between "x" and "kh,x" are due to an evolution in application. Originally, it was "kh" only, but then there was a significant trend toward the use of "œá". Eventually, "œá" was replaced with "x", both for ease of typing and because it‚Äôs a common convention. After some time, the "kh" fell into disuse.
:::The reason for the "straight" double quotes is ease of typing. The curly version is too difficult for the tiny benefit it gives.
:::I much prefer the use of "ts", but there has been a trend toward the use of "c"; in many cases, the "c" works well enough, but in some words, it is confusing to nonlinguists (e.g., "franc√∫z").
:::Which phonetic rules is it that you dislike?
:::In my English dictionary (Random House), stress in indicated in the head word.
:::The use of the acute accent this way is the only way I, as an American, have ever seen it done for foreign languages.
:::The pronunciation sections are for IPA or SAMPA. I don‚Äôt put IPA or SAMPA onto pages, and, like most Americans, I don‚Äôt use them when others put them. But they are certainly welcome if anyone wants to add them. The transcriptions are not suited to the pronunciation sections and don‚Äôt go there.
:::Not just this chart, but this entire page is a work in progress.
:::Before you mess with our years of work, first you have to take into consideration the audience. Native Russians who want to know what a Russian word means use the Russian Wiktionary. Russian entries in the English Wiktionary are intended for native English speakers. Linguists and other English-speakers who have at least a working knowledge of Russian use the Cyrillic, not the transcription. They only resort to the transcription to check to see where the accent falls. The only people who depend heavily on the transcriptions are casual users who know almost nothing about the language and who are not really interested in learning that much. These casual English-speaking nonlinguist users don‚Äôt know Cyrillic, usually don‚Äôt know IPA, and don‚Äôt really care to learn. They just want an approximate spelling in Roman letters.
:::For this reason, while —Ü as "c" is okay before "e" or "i", it is very confusing in other cases. For the same reason, "x" and "j" are problematic. The "x" and "j" have been adopted because there has been a slight consensus for it. There is a similar consensus for "c" instead of "ts", except when the "c" is not followed by "e" or "i".
:::As far as I can tell, the only differences that you see between this chart and the other is the addition of "x" to one and the addition of a short explanatory note in one. All that needs to be done is add them to the other.
:::As for choosing a romanization, this is where you have to consider the purpose of the romanization and the readership that will use it. The standard romanizations are intended for linguists, librarians and others who have specialized needs (most of these specialized needs have become moot since the advent of Unicode and the Internet...the people who used to need these special standardizations now have the orginal Cyrillic script, which is better than any romanization). On the English Wiktionary, the users of the romanizations are neither linguists nor Russian speakers. They are only interested in one or a few words in a rather general way.
:::We have given considerable thought to the current system, and the system is gradually changing as we sense changes in readership, education and culture.
:::Except for linguists and wordsmiths, the so-called syllabic accent is not well understood. And since there are similar symbols being used in different ways in different transcriptions, even I never know what they mean unless the word in the original script is one that I know. The syllabic accents are fine for the IPA/SAMPA in the pronunciation sections, but they are confusing and ambiguous in the transcriptions.
:::The only changes that I think are acceptable are adding "x" to this list (not really important, because this page is not yet in use), and adding "c" in addition to "ts" on both charts. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 15:16, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

:::: You're telling me that the system you've devised is superior to over a century of linguistics practice?  Enough to justify being completely inconsistent with linguistics papers which are still being published?  Is this based strictly on the "changes in readership, education and culture," which you "sense", or can you show me some documentation or discussion to back this up? ‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 00:29, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

:::::I‚Äôm saying that the linguistic practices were propelled by need, and that need is now suddenly past. Linguists do not have to settle for one or another of numerous transliteration schemes anymore. Now they can have the real McCoy. The people who actually need Roman transcription are nonlinguists who do not read Russian or Cyrillic. I come across lots of people who want to know, in a general way, how to write something in Russian in Roman letters, but I have NEVER received such a request from a native Russian or from anyone who spoke Russian. Everyone who knows Russian and who also knows the Roman alphabet can easily produce Roman transliterations at will, in any system they favor. The people who cannot do it are those who do not know Russian or Cyrillic and who don‚Äôt care to learn much of it. The people who would conceivably use one of your transliterations do not need your or my help to do it. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 01:38, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

:::::: Please spare us the personal anecdotes and speculation.  There is no "my transliteration".  I am defending a century of linguistics practice against the made-up "transliteration" described on this page.

:::::: Linguists use transliteration today, in print and electronic publishing.  For example, the ''Slavic and East European Journal'' [http://www.aatseel.org/contributor_info prefers transliteration over Cyrillic].

If you want me to "spare" you (and, according to you, everyone else) my ideas and beliefs (or anecdotes, speculation, and whatever other negative terms you come up with to describe it), and deliberately refuse to understand the meaning of things like "one of your tranliterations," then there is no point in my trying to continue this conversation with you.

=== Starting again ===

I realize that I've been getting to wound up about this.  I apologize to all for my tone.  I'd still like to try to clarify my concerns about transliteration, if anyone will listen.

I think there is still a need for orthographic transliteration, as opposed to phonetic transcription, and it is important to be consistent with academic practice.  Part of the difficulty in the discussion here is because we can't agree on basic implementation goals.  I'm going to give this a rest for a bit here, and work on clarifying some points in the general transliteration policy at [[Wiktionary talk:Transliteration]].¬†‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Mzajac]] 21:07, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

== Transliteration proposal ==

My understanding is that [[Appendix:Russian transliteration]] is the current guideline, and the material on this page is a work in progress.  To keep this clear for editors, I'm moving the latter to this talk page, and leaving a clear link and explanation on the guideline page.¬†‚Äî[[User:Mzajac|Michael Z.]] 20:48, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

*In the case of the reflexive verb endings '''-—Ç—å—Å—è''' and '''-—Ç—Å—è''', use '''‚Äô''' in place of '''j''': [[–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è]] = odev√°t‚Äôs‚Äôa; [[–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è|–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è]] = odev√°jets‚Äôa; [[–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è|–æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è]] = odev√°juts‚Äôa.

== Doesn't unicode end the need to agonize over transliteration? ==

I'll grant the need for transliteration back in the days before unicode, but in this day and age what's the point?  For anyone already familiar with the Latin alphabet, learning the cyrillic alphabet is no big deal, and pretty much ends the problem. Learning the genuine alphabet is no harder than nailing down the rules for just one transliteration scheme, let alone juggling multiple schemes, as we realistically must do when we read transliterated material.

If you don't want to russify your computer with a keyboard switcher, you can always go online and bring up a —è—à–µ—Ä—Ç—ã keyboard.  type out a word and paste it into Google; look it  up in an online dictionary.   Presto!  No more checking sometimes tens of variations of transliterated words containing —ë —è –µ —ã —É —é —â —ç —á –π —å —ä –∂ —Ö or —Ü!

:Yes, it only takes a half hour to learn it, but Americans tend to think it‚Äôs next to impossible and don‚Äôt want to try. As long as there are Americans, there will be a need for transliteration.

:: Following Stephen, I guess if you're an author, unicode means you can give a rough-and-ready transliteration, followed by the word in proper cyrillic in parentheses.  Then there's no need for a picky transliteration system that lets an informed reader reconstruct cyrillic no matter what.

::::: I'm not sure what you disagree with.  Yes, some schemes do aim for reversibility.  [[w:ISO 9:1995]] does so, but I have never seen it actually used.  The strict version of ALA-LC and BGN/PCGN for Slavic languages do too, but they are rarely used that way in practice.  We have chosen to use linguistics systems for many languages in Wiktionary, which is not reversible by machine, but reasonably unambiguous for anyone who's used to it, if one knows which language is being transliterated.  I'm not sure what you mean by "rough-and-ready", but ''IusÕ°hcÕ°henko, Yushchenko, Ju≈°ƒçenko, ''and'' Juschtchenko'' just don't mix, so it's best to follow the chosen convention.

== Shouldn't diminutives of names have separate entries? ==

For example under [[–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä]] I see the diminutives –°–∞—à–∞, –®—É—Ä–∞.  But let's say someone gets called Sashenka in the novel I'm reading and I don't have a clue who they're talking about.  It would be good to be able to look it up and be directed to [[–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä]] or [[Aleksandr]] (which has no entry, by the way).  

A great project for a rainy day, I'm sure.  Nevertheless do we need a guideline that if you create an entry for an [[–∏–º—è]], it's good form to create linking entries for its diminutives?

Similarly we have colloquial reductions of patronymics, e.g. M–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á -> –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–∏—á,  –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á -> –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∏—á and maybe even –í–∞–Ω–∏—á. [[Special:Contributions/76.168.50.104|76.168.50.104]] 21:07, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, they should have individual entries, with links to the base name and related forms. Whenever I make an entry for a name, I include links to diminutives, etc. See for example [[–ò–≤–∞–Ω]]. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 21:17, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

::–°—Ç—é—Ä–∞ - you created links but not entries, and the entries actually don't exist yet.  So [[–í–∞–Ω—è]] doesn't go anywhere and [[Vanya]] only goes to an unrelated homonymn.  [[Ivan]] oddly doesn't show the Russian instance, although there are entries for other Slavic languages.

::–¢–∞–∫ - Shouldn't we have guidelines encouraging actual entries for diminutives of names in cyrillic (and in transliteration)?  They could just redirect to the main [[–∏–º—è]].  A –í–∞–Ω—è entry could simply redirect to –í–∞–Ω—è under [[–ò–≤–∞–Ω]].  To help newbies we can create formal definitions of Russian diminutives, endearments and pejoratives and always link to them.  

:: In the same way, we could created redirection entries for patronymics including variations –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á -> –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∏—á, –í–∞–Ω–∏—á etc.

:: [[User:LADave|LADave]] 19:42, 26 June 2008 (UTC) (O.P. who neglected to log in the first time)

:::Yes, I created the base name with redlinks. Red links are an invitation to write. If I didn‚Äôt want the entries,   I would not have made the links. [[Ivan]] doesn‚Äôt show the Russian only because no one has begun a translation section there. You may if you wish. [[John]] does have the Russian.
:::Diminutives should not be simply redirects, they have to be full-fledged entries, including declension. [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 18:13, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::: Assuming omitting plural forms isn't a mortal sin when it comes to proper nouns.  Better yet, put it in a table with grammatical cases across by diminutive variations down.

:::: The advantage over full-fledged entries for each diminutive would be calling the reader's attention to the –∏–º—è context in all its rococo glory, while not neglecting inflections. [[User:LADave|LADave]] 20:34, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::::That would mean that [[–ò–≤–∞–Ω]] would have to have twelve declension tables just for the forms that are there right now (not every possible form has been added yet). That would make the page extremely unwieldy and we just don‚Äôt do it like that.
:::::The plurals have to be included unless a word has no plural. There are some cases where I have not bothered to add the plural declensions where no plural exists, yet a plural is theoretically possible (as in "two Californias"). These could, and probably should, have the plurals added in. But when plurals actually exist, then they really need to be included.
:::::Either in the etymology of the diminutive or in its definition line (or both), it must be pointed out that it is a diminutive, pejorative, etc., of the linked base name.
:::::Off the top of my head, the only valid redirects that I can think of for Russian are redirects of [[–µ]] spellings to [[—ë]] spellings ([[–µ—â–µ]] redirects to [[–µ—â—ë]]). But if another language, word or form has that spelling, then it can‚Äôt be a redirect ([[–º–µ–¥#Russian|–º–µ–¥]]). [[User:Stephen G. Brown|‚ÄîStephen]] 20:55, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::::: Plural –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ almost seem hypothetical. Apparently it's bad form to give a full –∏–º—è all by itself, so at least two of someone's names would need to match up before plurals should come into play.  But then if it's OK to use diminutives in isolation, does this give rise to populations of plurals like –í–∞–Ω–∏ = –í–∞–Ω—è-–∞ + –í–∞–Ω—è-–± +...+ –í–∞–Ω—è-–Ω "in the wild"?  Methinks the rule of three instances comes into play.  If there aren't enough instances, leave it out.

:::::: Re tables, I don't think it's actually so unwieldy.  One table for neutral dimimutives, one table for endearments and one table for deprecatives.  It's simpler without plurals, but you could have two rows of inflections each:

:     –∏–º.     –≤–∏–Ω.   —Ä–æ–¥.    –ø—Ä–µ–¥.  –¥–∞—Ç.   —Ç–≤.
:–µ–¥.  '''–°–∞—à–∞'''   –°–∞—à—É  –°–∞—à–∏   –°–∞—à–µ  –°–∞—à–µ  –°–∞—à–µ–π

:::::: Re homonyms, If they exist in other (cyrillic) languages, isn't it kosher to disambiguate and then redirect? 

:::::: Re redirection, it seems to me there are fresh opportunities to explore in electronic dictionaries.  Redirection is a PITA in paper dictionaries, but not here.  

:::::: Another redirection possibility -- all verbs within the -—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å/-–π—Ç–∏ paradigm -- such as –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å(—Å—è)/–Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏(—Å—å) -- might be redirected to a unified treatment.  My reasoning is that the sooner a reader sees this particular forest and not just the occasional tree, the better. [[User:LADave|LADave]] 09:22, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:::::::I don‚Äôt follow you. Plurals are often not easy to figure out, and they are an integral part of the grammar when the plural exists. If the nominative singular exists, it gets the full range of grammar, including forms which may be difficult to find examples of. If you have a group of friends over, there could be several Vanyas and several Sashas. You might ask the Vanyas to run hide, and then the Sashas to try to find them. You use the plural forms for that.
:::::::There cannot be "one table for neutral dimimutives, one table for endearments and one table for deprecatives", because different forms can have different declensions. Each form has to have its separate page with its own complete grammar described.

One reason is that we want to have every word in every language, and a redirect in one language may well be a lemma in another.

:::::: Re tables, in my example –°–∞—à–∞ and –®—É—Ä–∞ are each declined in six cases (columns) by two numbers (rows).  Adding and declining –°–∞–Ω—è and –ê–ª–∏–∫ would give a table of eight rows by six columns (plus captions) for all four neutral diminutives of –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä.  Then the five endearing forms would be a table of ten rows by six, the four deprecatives would be eight rows by six, etc.

== [[—Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ]] ==

At the moment, [[—Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ|this word]] is transliterated "(s√≥lnce) n (read: s√≥nce)". Personally, I think that's good, and clearer than e.g. [[–µ–≥–æ]], which gives its transliteration as "jev√≥", even though by ''transliteration'' (change of letters from one script to another) "–≥" ‚Üí "g" and /j…™Ààvo/ is merely the word's ''pronunciation''. But which of the two entries should be updated to be like the other? I think [[–µ–≥–æ]] (et [[–Ω–µ–≥–æ]] et al) should be changed to be like [[—Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ]]: I'm not sure how many people realise that "jev√≥" is not just a typo for "jeg√≥", and I have a hard time imagining that, if [[—Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ]] is changed to give just "s√≥nce" as its translit, anyone at all will recognise that the missing 'l' isn't a typo but an ''intentional'' effort to provide a second, [[pseudo#Adjective|pseudo]] pronunciation outside of the pronunciation section. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:17, 3 April 2013 (UTC)

:Providing both "jeg√≥" and "jev√≥" is not such a bad idea but providing the actual pronunciation is more important than giving letter-to-letter transliteration. If I had to choose between "s√≥lnce" and "s√≥nce", "ƒçto" and "≈°to" ("[[—á—Ç–æ]]") I would choose "s√≥nce" and "≈°to". "s√≥lnce" can be produced by a tool but manually overwritten with "s√≥nce". [[WT:RU TR]] says "silent consonants in consonant clusters are transliterated", so "s√≥lnce" is our standard anyway but "–≥" in -–æ–≤–æ and -–µ–≤–æ genitive/accusative ending is "v". It's OK if tools like Lua produces "g", it can then manually be overwritten with "v". Misreading "–≥" in adjective endings is common with foreigners (including Slavs and rural Russians in South Russia and Ukraine). Similarly, it doesn't make sense to transliterate [[—á—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π]] and [[–∂—ë–ª—Ç—ã–π]] as "ƒçj√≥rnyj" and "≈æj√≥ltyj", the correct value of "—ë" is "√≥" ("—ë" is stressed in 99% of cases) - "ƒç√≥rnyj" and "≈æ√≥ltyj". The 1917 reform planned but didn't do this change, replace "—ë" with "–æ" after "—á", "—à", "—â" and "–∂"- "—á–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π" and "–∂–æ–ª—Ç—ã–π"' but "—á—ë—Ä—Ç" can also be spelled "—á–æ—Ä—Ç"
:English words like [[trader]] and [[trailer]] are transliterated into Russian as "—Ç—Ä–µ–π–¥–µ—Ä" and "—Ç—Ä–µ–π–ª–µ—Ä" (not "—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–µ—Ä" / "—Ç—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ—Ä" or "—Ç—Ä—ç–π–¥–∞" / "—Ç—Ä—ç–π–ª–∞") a combination of phonetic and spelling.

== Thank you ==

At my new job I have two coworkers from Ukraine, and with their help I've started learning a bit of Russian. I've been using Wiktionary to look up words and inflections, and I've been impressed with how extensive our coverage of Russian seems to be. I'm sure there's still a lot more to do, but this is already a very useful resource for Russian language learners like me. So, —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ to the editors who work on our Russian entries, and keep up the good work! ‚Äî[[User:Mx. Granger|Granger]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Mx. Granger|talk]] '''¬∑''' [[Special:Contributions/Mx.

== "low colloquial" vs. "nonliterary"? ==

{{wgping|ru|u1=Atitarev|u2=Cinemantique|u3=Useigor|u4=Wikitiki89|u5=Stephen G. Brown|u6=Guldrelokk|u7=Fay Freak|u8=Tetromino|u9=Per utramque cavernam}} I've generally been using the label "low colloquial" to translate Russian ''–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç.'' (as found in some dictionaries) and ''—Ä–∞–∑–≥. —Å–Ω–∏–∂.'' (as found in other dictionaries). This is somewhat of a literal translation of ''—Ä–∞–∑–≥. —Å–Ω–∏–∂.'', and has the advantage that if rendered like this: {{temp|lb|ru|low|_|colloquial}}, it categorizes the term into [[:CAT:Russian colloquialisms]]. But I'm starting to think that it might be better to use the label "nonliterary". This can be added as a general label, so that it categorizes the term into [[:CAT:Russian nonliterary terms]]. Questions:
# Is "nonliterary" an accurate rendering of this term?
# If so, should we use it?
# Am I correct in assuming that ''–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç.'' and ''—Ä–∞–∑–≥. —Å–Ω–∏–∂.'' are actually the same thing?

* #3. Yes, some dictionaries decided that ''–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–µ—á–Ω–æ–µ'' is not good term, and they used ''—Ä–∞–∑–≥.-—Å–Ω–∏–∂.'' or just ''—Å–Ω–∏–∂.''--[[User:Cinemantique|Cinemantique]] ([[User talk:Cinemantique|talk]]) 05:17, 27 December 2018 (UTC)
: #3 - no, it depends. I see many examples where ''—Ä–∞–∑–≥.-—Å–Ω–∏–∂.'' means more than just nonliterary; it instead refers to a particular rough, low register of colloquial speech. If you use a lot of such words in your speech, it carries the sentiment that you don't much like the thing that you are talking about and might not much like anything else for that matter; that you are a hard person and that you lead a hard life.

If a word is ‚Äújust how people talk‚Äù it is not ‚Äúlow‚Äù.

::: {{ping|Benwing2}} Informal and colloquial language is what is outside the literary standard (barring certain types like dramata). And thus it is everywhere and not generally low. And {{m|ru|–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–µÃÅ—á–∏–µ}} does not mean more than this, in as much as –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æÃÅ–π means ordinary. ''‚ÄùLow colloquial‚Äù is an overstatement,''  that‚Äôs what I say, or you have to take care that the meaning of ‚Äúlow‚Äù is not hollowed out by constant use in a translation of a Russian term. I have already seen terms being termed ‚Äúlow colloquial‚Äù here when they weren‚Äôt low but the original labelling was probably right. There isn‚Äôt a guarantee that Russian usage notes condensed in single words can be mapped upon certain English expressions (the expectation of the technical terms having secure translations is mistaken), so when making the knowledge transfer to English you will either exaggerate or lose information if you don‚Äôt know the usage except from having read it from labels in Russian dictionaries, but better lose (in as much as it is better to have no label than a wrong label).

A few years ago, I ran a simpler version of this script. At the time, [[User:Wikitiki89]] objected to auto-accenting quotes hidden by #*.

::: {{ping|Benwing2}}: As you know, I don't object to this and would even encourage. For foreign learners it's far more important to get the right stress and pronunciation than the graphical similarity with the original. The quotes from literature are systematically used with accents in texts for young readers and foreigners. Pls note that the normalisation will include replacing "–µ" with "—ë" where appropriate, which is not easy.  Inserting a stress mark or writing out "—ë" (where appropriate) is not considered a "change" to the original text by Russians. I don't object to linking words in usexes to lemmas either. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 05:16, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
:::: {{ping|Atitarev}}: Cool. I already ran the auto-accenter on lemma pages (which accounts for 99.9% of the total set of words missing accents or links). As for changing –µ to —ë, my code currently only does this if there's an explicit entry for the –µ variant that links to the —ë variant. With some work I could probably have it handle most instances even without explicit entries; I do this for adjectives, for example, by recognizing the various adjective endings (e.g. -—ã–º–∏) and constructing the possible stems from it.

=== Auto-creating pre-1918 forms ===
I have noticed that your auto-accenting and auto-bracketing often fails in pre-1918 quotes because the pre-1918 forms are not created. I suggest to create the pre-1918 forms automatically if they are given in ‚Äúalternative forms‚Äù sections with {{temp|ru-PRO}}, since this should be doable and if somebody has added this form he has checked that it exists. If the entries are created by bot this will fruitfully fill the dictionary with the pre-1918 spellings since then we only have to add the ‚Äùalternative forms‚Äù section as compared to creating new pages, towards which there is no excitement. {{wgping|ru|u1=Atitarev|u2=Benwing2|u3=Cinemantique|u4=Useigor|u5=Wikitiki89|u6=Stephen G.

:{{ping|Fay Freak}} OK, I can look into this, if others agree. It shouldn't be terribly hard. Note that my auto-accenting bot is smart enough to infer adjective forms even if they don't already exist, but this is harder to do for nouns and verbs because the morphology is more complex and the endings are less obviously identifiable compared with adjectival endings like -—ã—Ö and -—ã–º–∏.

:::{{ping|Fay Freak}} I thought about this some more. My auto-accenting bot can make automatically infer the accent and lemma for many old-style spellings; e.g. if it can't find a given word that ends in -—ä, it can check the corresponding word without the -—ä, and if it's found, it can work out the proper lemma by adding -—ä onto nouns that end in a hard consonant. It can also do the same trick when converting -–∞–≥–æ to -–æ–≥–æ. It can also convert any —£ to –µ and check that word to find the accented syllable and the modern-spelling lemma, and derive the old-spelling lemma by checking for an {{temp|ru-PRO}} line in the modern lemma. Even if {{temp|ru-PRO}} isn't present, it may be able to put back the —£ in the right place in many cases; I'd have to think about this some more though. For all of these tricks, it wouldn't be necessary to use my form-creating bot to create entries for old-style non-lemma forms. There may be some special cases where having the old-style non-lemma form entries is needed; I'll have to think about this.
:::One thing to note though is that many {{temp|ru-PRO}} links are missing. For example, until I just added them, neither {{m|ru|–µ—Å—Ç—å||to [[eat]]}} nor {{m|ru|–¥–µ—Ç—å}} had {{temp|ru-PRO}} links. If you could add them to the most common words, it would be very helpful.

Anyone have a good reference for mapping between modern and pre-reform spellings? I've been using slavenica.com but I've found a few weirdnesses that make me wonder how accurate it is.

‚Äª {–≤—£—Å—å} ‚Äî –≤—£—Å—å –¥–µ–Ω—å. 
‚´Ω {–≤–µ—Å—å} ‚Äî –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è, —Å–µ–ª–æ.
</pre>
::::::But this disagrees with our dictionary, which says the pre-reform spelling of {{m|ru|–≤–µ—Å—å||[[every]], [[all]]}} is still {{m|ru|–≤–µ—Å—å}}.
::::::Contrariwise, when converting {{m|ru|–≤–µ–∫}} to pre-reform spelling, Slavenica says this:
<pre>
‚Äª {–≤–µ–∫–æ} ‚Äî —á–∞—Å—Ç—å —Ç–µ–ª–∞.
‚´Ω {–≤—£–∫—ä} ‚Äî –≤—Ä–µ–º—è.

::::::This also disagrees (in the other direction in terms of –µ vs. —£) with our dictionary, which says that {{m|ru|–≤–µÃÅ–∫–æ||eyelid}} is {{m|ru|–≤—£ÃÅ–∫–æ}} in pre-reform spelling.
::::::Are there variations in pre-reform spelling that might account for this?

:::::::: {{ping|Atitarev}} Yeah, I've heard about how much people hated the spelling rules for —£/–µ.

The situation with 'ea' vs. 'ee', for example, is directly parallel to the situation with —£ and –µ, but I've rarely if ever heard people make a big deal about this. Spanish has similar issues with b vs. v and ll vs. y, and in Latin America also s vs. c/z, but I've never heard any serious proposals there either for spelling reform.

::::::::: People didn‚Äôt hate the spelling rules, only the lazy and slow kids. You know how commie teenagers are today? That‚Äôs how they have been back then in Russia. The only difference is that back then they actually grabbed power so they could repaint history to their favour, obliterating what was favourable to the old and exaggerating hardships, not to speak of killing everyone who would keep up excellent education, as they always do. Russia was a normal country until the Bolsheviks came.
::::::::: Like reds don‚Äôt understand  basic economy they don‚Äôt understand that it matters little if it is harder to write when it is actually easier to read, since people have to read texts more than texts have to be written. —£ gives additional distinctions into the text, there are minimal pairs like {{m|ru|–ª—£—á—ÉÃÅ|t=I heal}}, {{m|ru|–ª–µ—á—ÉÃÅ|t=I fly}} but in general the character stands out and helps you, and {{m|ru|—ñ}} flows well: Nowadays the texts with only {{m|ru|–∏}}¬†and {{m|ru|–µ}} are a monotonous mass that strains the eye. The same way it is actually easier to read {{m|de|Fraktur}} than ''{{w|Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua}}'' (if you get used to it!). The socialist Hitler did not understand it either, unsurprisingly, and abolished all blackletter printing and writing in 1941 (so called {{m|de|Normalschrifterla√ü}}). Again in 1996 after the merger of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany they made a ‚Äú{{w|German orthography reform of 1996|reform}}‚Äù to make it easier for children to write. The result is that it isn‚Äôt easier to write, the new rules have multiple times as many rules and children are unsure how to write. Might it have been a part of the programme of former GDR cadres who have taken seat in the West to level it down to obtain gains for their God of equality? Always be wary. There is no reason to assume of a ‚Äúreform‚Äù that it is intended to be a improvement for the common weal. History does not always progress.
::::::::: Apparently it isn‚Äôt hard to write the old spellings either. I write them automatically. One only needs to read things in the spelling here and there. And even though today ‚Äì and in Germany! ‚Äì traditional spelling texts do not pour in upon me it is like this. So much easier they must have had it when there was the spelling all around.

== Middle Russian? ==

{{wgping|ru|u1=Atitarev|u2=Benwing2|u3=Cinemantique|u4=Useigor|u5=Wikitiki89|u6=Stephen G. Brown|u7=Guldrelokk|u8=Fay Freak|u9=Tetromino}} Hello. At [[Reconstruction talk:Proto-Slavic/≈æelza]], Guldrelokk and I have discussed a bit about the possible need for a new language header/language code, which would cover XVth-XVIIth century Russian, as distinct both from Old Russian/Old East Slavic and Modern Russian.

Indeed, at [[Talk:-—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å]], speaking about a spelling such as {{m|ru|–Ω—Ä–∞–≤—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ}}, Guldrelokk says that "they were normal as recently as in the 17th century and cannot be called Old East Slavic either ‚Äì the period overall is uncovered".

If we were to give this period a language header indeed, I think we could call it "Middle Russian": 
* It would have the advantage of being in alignment with "Middle Armenian", "Middle English", "Middle French" and so on;
* It has some (admittedly very sparse) currency: [https://books.google.ru/books?id=eepWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22middle+russian%22], [https://books.google.ru/books?id=pSmlACZTxbMC&pg=PA261&dq=middle+russian&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE8Y7E897fAhUHWCwKHa7sBsEQ6AEIODAB#v=onepage&q=middle%20russian&f=false]
* Imo, it sounds better than the translation of Zaliznyak's preferred denomination: {{m|ru|—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π|tr=-}}, "Old Great(er) Russian", which looks a bit pompous in English.

However, this designation also has the inconvenient of being used to speak about the Central Russian dialects ({{m|ru|—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π|—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ|tr=-}} –¥–∏–∞–ª–µ–∫—Ç—ã) as well.

Of course, there's always the option of simply tagging those words/spellings as obsolete.

What do you think?

:{{ping|Per utramque cavernam}} In Russia, this language period is often referred to as [[:w:ru:–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫#–°—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π_–ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥|—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π]], which literally means "Old Russian", but I think a better (and more widely used) English equivalent would be "Early Modern Russian".

And where are the linguistic arguments? There must be sufficient typological differences like for Middle English, for Middle French, Middle High German and so on. I can think of a lot of features that distinguish Middle High German from Old High German and from New High German and Middle English from Old English and New English, but 17th century Russian is well understandable for someone who knows Modern Russian well, and XVth century Russian is about the limit. To me it seems there are only enough differences to distinguish two stages, not three. This also aligns to what is done with the other Slavic languages: Old Czech, Old Polish, not Middle Czech or Middle Polish. And Old Church Slavonic is a synonym to Old Bulgarian and at the same time on Wiktionary covers all kinds of literary Slavic languages. {{w|Middle Bulgarian}} as on Wikipedia is yet to be shown as worth the distinction. The comparates here are most far-fetched, as {{ping|Per utramque cavernam}} not only skipped the Slavic analoga but also picked the fastest-changing languages in the Romanic and Germanic world, and even in the fast languages there isn‚Äôt alignment.
there isn‚Äôt an alignment since for example [[Wiktionary:About Middle French|Middle French]] is said to be until 1609 while you know yourself that Modern English was more than a hundred years there at that point, and Spanish and Portuguese do not need a middle, I even doubt if ‚ÄúOld Spanish‚Äù and ‚ÄúOld Portuguese‚Äù are really necessary, and Middle High German goes until the beginning of the 1400s while Middle Low German until the early 1600s. This is all because of features in the language: If I see a text I should be able to say if it is Middle High German or New High German or Old High German without knowing the date (the manuscript doesn‚Äôt state it always, and editors don‚Äôt need to care‚ÄØ‚Äì¬†example under {{m|de|Schnalle}}, sense ‚Äúharlot, hooker, strumpet‚Äù where I had to date a text only by  the language), but there isn‚Äôt much to make you confident in distinguishing three stages of Russian (nor of Polish‚ÄØ‚Ä¶). Don‚Äôt get duped by the distinctions scholars make in languages stages: They also talk of ‚ÄúMiddle Arabic‚Äù while texts from the period in question are just Arabic, and this concept is also reprehended by other scholars. Scholars construct stages to make certain points, but lexicographically we must ask if the distinction is useful for our purposes: Clearly ‚ÄúMiddle Arabic‚Äù is to be dismissed for our purposes since sixth-century Arabic to the greatest extent like today‚Äôs literary Arabic and it would have unsolvable hardships from the existing material to do any cut. Similarly ask yourself if from the texts you know of you can discern two or three languages. (Probably you don‚Äôt know such texts because there isn‚Äôt that much literature edited or sold to you, and this is the reason why we have an ‚Äúuncovered period‚Äù). Spellings like {{m|ru|–Ω—Ä–∞–≤—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ}} do not arouse in me any desire to have a new language stage, the differences must be greater. So we have Ukrainian and Belarusian because some sound developments and systematic spelling decisions and some ending differences and differences in basic words like conjunctions and pronouns in addition to generally detached development of the lexicon justify treating it under other headers. But what detaches Old Russian from New Russian, and can you find two major lines in it wherein a Middle Russian could find place?

:Many phonetic and morphological developments took place between the very archaic stage represented by Wiktionary‚Äôs normalised ‚ÄòOld East Slavic‚Äô and ‚ÄòRussian‚Äô, which doesn‚Äôt go further back than the 18th century in practice. This is well covered in standard reference works.
:The question concerns several hundred manuscripts and early printed books. Their material, amounting to hundreds unique words and wordforms, is distributed among general and specialised dictionaries (e. g. ''–°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –æ–±–∏—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –†—É—Å–∏ XVI‚ÄîXVII –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤'') and is currently hard to categorise in Wiktionary. The significance of such works as ''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas'', ''Domostroy'', princes‚Äô correspondency etc. goes well beyond the fields of linguistics and philology. We also have the first genuine examples of Russian speech from that time, thanks particularly to jurisprudence recording common people‚Äôs testimonies.
:Importantly, for both Middle Russian and Middle Bulgarian accentological data is available, which is a goldmine for comparative Slavic accentology. [[User:Guldrelokk|Guldrelokk]] ([[User talk:Guldrelokk|talk]]) 17:07, 17 February 2019 (UTC)
::‚ÄúIn practice‚Äù. In practice usually Russian lexicography does not even go further back than Pushkin and this is where popular literary history starts. What are the features by which one can distinguish three stages? The way you put it there is just a transitional age: ‚ÄúMany phonetic and morphological developments‚Äù ‚Äì maybe only from Old East Slavic to New Russian. Or it seems that from the corpus Old East Slavic and New Russian coexisted, since we have ‚Äúcommon people‚Äôs testimonies‚Äù and elsewhere Old East Slavic was written. The former being the –æ–±–∏—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫ while some texts are written in Old East Slavic? Old East Slavic texts quoting New Russian texts? Like Latin texts quoting Old French speech? But it does not sound like there being three layers. You say there is something difficult to categorize but you make things ''even more difficult to categorize'' by introducing three stages.

@Benwing2
Thank you, I had not been aware of these but the "module" pages are very informative. 
I must ask since I have the chance now. What is the source/method used regarding the categotization of Russian declension and parts of speech? I see linguist Andrey Zaliznyak cited often. Is this the primary author of the Russian categorization used by Wiktionary? Is personal research also used for this?
I am a studier of Russian and have been using wiktionary as my primary source of study regarding declension patterns. The information found here is more detailed than other sources I have come by. 
In regards to questions such as regarding declension patterns is this the appropriate page to ask on? This may be a moderator page from the looks of it. [[User:Isaac1901|Isaac1901]] ([[User talk:Isaac1901|talk]]) 23:11, 26 February 2020 (UTC)

== Rhymes ==

{{wgping|ru|u1=Atitarev|u2=Benwing2|u3=Cinemantique|u4=Useigor|u5=Wikitiki89|u6=Stephen G. Brown|u7=Guldrelokk|u8=Fay Freak|u9=Per utramque cavernam}} {{Ping|Wittiami}} has recently added some rhyme info, and while the effort is noble, the results are in some cases super wrong (see [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion/Others#Russian_non-rhymes]]). So before people spend more of their time on this, let's take a pause and talk about what rhymes work in Russian. Here follow some observations off the top of my head (which perhaps contradict what you learned about rhyme in English language poetry):

# Rhymes ignore word boundaries. Short phrases need rhyme entries just like words.
# Rhymes match most strongly on the stressed vowel and preceding consonant. Other sounds towards the end of the word may not matter. Consider Rozenbaum: {{m|ru|[[–∫—Ä–∞–π]] [[–±—É—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ã–π|–±—É'''—Ä–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ'''–≤—ã–π]] // [[–ø–æ–¥]] [[–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∞|–æ—Ö'''—Ä–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ'''—é]]}} - ['''Ààran…ô'''v…®j] rhymes with [Ààx'''ran…ô'''j ä]. This is especially true of word-final –π, whose pronunciation is reduced in casual speech; consider Pushkin: {{m|ru|[[–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è|–≤—å—éÃÅ—Ç—Å—è]] [[—Ç—É—á–∞|'''—Ç—ÉÃÅ—á–∏''']] // [[—Å–Ω–µ–≥]] [[–ª–µ—Ç—É—á–∏–π|–ª–µ'''—Ç—ÉÃÅ—á–∏'''–π]]}}.
# There are "rich rhymes" (where the preceding consonants must coincide) and "poor rhymes" (where they don't need to - as long as there is at least one other consonant in the rhyme). So a word like {{m|ru|—Å–ª–∞ÃÅ–≤–∞}} should list at least ''two'' rhymes: -lava (matching e.g. {{m|ru|[[–æ–±–ª–∞–≤–∞|–æ–±'''–ª–∞ÃÅ–≤–∞''']]}}) and -ava (matching e.g. {{m|ru|[[–ø–æ—Ä–∞|–ø–æ—Ä'''–∞ÃÅ''']] [[–≤—ã|'''–≤–∞'''–º]]}} - whether you choose "rich" or "poor" depends on your preference as a poet.
#* But even in "rich rhymes", the preceding consonants sometimes might not match exactly. Famous example: Lermontov's {{m|ru|[[–ª–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å|–ª–æ–≤–ª—éÃÅ]] // [[–Ω–∞]] [[–Æ]]}} - [l…êÀàv'''l ≤u''' n…ê‚ÄøÀà'''ju'''] - a palatalized approximant matches a glide for rich rhyme purposes.
# Sometimes [o] can rhyme with […µ]; {{m|ru|[[–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥|–Ω–∞—Ä'''–æÃÅ–¥''']] // [[–ø–µ—Ç—å|–ø–æ'''—ë—Ç''']]}} [n…êÀàr'''ot''' p…êÀàj'''…µt'''] works as a rhyme. Same can be true for [i] and […®]; think of {{m|ru|[[—Å–∏ÃÅ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π]] // [[—Å—Å—ãÃÅ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π]]}}. And sometimes [a] and [√¶]: {{m|ru|[[–≤—Å—Ç–∞ÃÅ—Ç—å]] // [[–æ–ø—èÃÅ—Ç—å]]}}.

Before adding more rhyme info, we need to come up with a structure that accounts for these (and other) features of Russian poetry. [[User:Tetromino|Tetromino]] ([[User talk:Tetromino|talk]]) 05:39, 27 February 2019 (UTC)
: I thought that some of the allophones distinguished in the current rhyme transcription system might actually rhyme.
: I wonder if it would be better to render rhymes in a phonemic transcription, in which the allophones {{IPAchar|[…µ]}} and {{IPAchar|[o]}} are both transcribed as {{IPAchar|/o/}}, {{IPAchar|[a]}} and {{IPAchar|[√¶]}} as {{IPAchar|/a/}}, and so on. I guess the transcription would have to show vowel reduction (for instance, rendering unstressed and reduced {{lang|ru|–æ}} as {{IPAchar|/a/}}). Using the same symbol for the pairs of allophones would make it clear that they can sometimes rhyme. I suggest this tentatively because the discussions that I was watching on [[w:Talk:Russian phonology|Talk:Russian phonology]] on Wikipedia gave me the impression that some aspects of Russian phonemic transcription are controversial. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 06:05, 27 February 2019 (UTC)
:: Yes, for the rhyme titles themselves. And in the pronunciation line one should give both as phonetic, since {{IPAchar|[…µ]}} and {{IPAchar|[√¶]}} are not necessary and do not exist in every idiolect as much as they are put here by the automatic transliteration. Only because linguists have observed these realizations does not mean they are generally there. For me it‚Äôs [p…êÀàjoÃût] or as is given on {{m|ru|–∂–∂—ë—Ç}} (a bit closer than my German […î] as in {{m|de|Boss}} in any case) and not [p…êÀàj…µt], same in {{m|ru|–±—å—ë—Ç}} etc. ‚Äì though definitely both exist, the latter seems ‚ÄúMuscovite‚Äù. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 12:42, 27 February 2019 (UTC)
: Assuming there where you say¬†‚Äúpreceding‚Äù you mean ‚Äúsucceding‚Äù (replace the wording and remove this notice, I recommend), this is what coincides with my perceptions about what a good rhyme in Russian rap is.¬†So it could be that the declined locative of {{m|ru|–≥–µÃÅ—Ç—Ç–æ}} rhymes with {{m|ru|–≤–µÃÅ—Ç–µ—Ä}}. [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 12:42, 27 February 2019 (UTC)
:: Good point that succeeding consonant often matters - but if the stressed syllable is the last one in the word, then succeeding consonant isn't needed when preceding matches: {{m|ru|[[–ø—ã—Ö—Ç–µ—Ç—å|–ø—ã—Ö'''—Ç–∏ÃÅ'''—Ç]] // [[–≤]] [[–ø—É—Ç—å|–ø—É'''—Ç–∏ÃÅ''']]}}. [[User:Tetromino|Tetromino]] ([[User talk:Tetromino|talk]]) 14:28, 27 February 2019 (UTC)
::: From the examples you give it seemed and seems to me that what matters is mainly the stressed vowel, the succeding consonant and the succeding vowel.

Brown|u6=Guldrelokk|u7=Fay Freak|u8=Tetromino|u9=Per utramque cavernam}} The search box has been updated, and now if you type in a word with –µ instead of —ë, and the word with –µ doesn't exist (e.g. {{m|ru|—á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ—Ö–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫}} instead of {{m|ru|—á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä—ë—Ö–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫}}), you'll automatically be brought to the correct word with —ë. Also, the autocompletion mechanism suggests words with —ë in place of –µ if you type in the form of the word with –µ. This suggests that all these soft redirect pages like {{m|ru|—Ç—Ä–µ—Ö—ç—Ç–∞–∂–Ω—ã–π}} linking to {{m|ru|—Ç—Ä—ë—Ö—ç—Ç–∞–∂–Ω—ã–π}} aren't so necessary any more. As it is, we have a pretty random collection of soft –µ-to-—ë redirects, hard –µ-to-—ë redirects, and missing redirects, and I'd like to make this more sane. I suggest the following:
# Keep soft –µ-to-—ë redirects whenever the form with –µ is a word in its own right (in any language; e.g. {{m|ru|–∫—Ä–µÃÅ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π}} is a Russian word in its own right as well as a possible spelling of {{m|ru|–∫—Ä—ë—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π}}, so we'd keep the soft redirect; likewise, {{m|bg|–ª–µ–¥}} is a word in Bulgarian [and in Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian, for that matter] meaning "ice", as well as a possible spelling of Russian {{m|ru|–ª—ë–¥}}, so again we'd keep the soft redirect).
# Use a bot to create the missing soft –µ-to-—ë redirects of the above type.
# Delete any soft –µ-to-—ë redirect pages where the sole purpose is to be a soft redirect; this way the search mechanism will automatically redirect.
# Delete any hard –µ-to-—ë redirect pages.

:::{{ping|Atitarev}} I'm not proposing deleting all soft redirects, just ones where the soft redirect is the only entry on the page. With that entry gone, the search page automatically does the redirect, e.g. typing in "–µ—â–µ" would automatically bring up [[–µ—â—ë]] if not for the soft redirect. With the soft redirect present, both pages [[–µ—â–µ]] and [[–µ—â—ë]] show up in the autocompletions when typing "–µ—â–µ", which to me suggests that they are two different words, which I find confusing.
:::What would you suggest as an alternative? Should we use a bot to generate *all* possible soft redirects (either only for lemmas, or also for non-lemmas)? The main thing I'm trying to fix is the current situation where we have a random and incomplete collection of soft and hard redirects, and no clear rules for whether to create a redirect (soft or hard) when creating a new entry with —ë in it.

== Verbal complements: which case, which preposition? ==

{{wgping|ru|u1=Atitarev|u2=Benwing2|u3=Cinemantique|u4=Useigor|u5=Wikitiki89|u6=Stephen G. Brown|u7=Guldrelokk|u8=Fay Freak|u9=Tetromino}} Hi. We currently don't have a systematic way of presenting that kind of information, and we do it very sparsely at any rate. 

An example: as a native French speaker, I'm tempted to use {{m|ru|–∞–ø–ª–æ–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å||to applaud}} as its French equivalent, i.e. with a direct object (in the accusative), when that verb actually requires the dative case. 

We do have some templates to handle this ({{temp|+obj}}, {{temp|+preo}}, {{temp|+posto}}), but they never been much used, and I find them ugly; the one I use for French and English is {{temp|indtr}}, but it's not perfect either, in that it can't be used for languages that have a case system. 

Thoughts? Suggestions?

On a related note, I've learned that some verbs taking a direct object (in the accusative) as their complement, and which could theoretically undergo passivization, don't actually do (an example: {{m|ru|—Å–æ–ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∂–¥–∞—Ç—å||to accompany}}). Wouldn't it be a good idea to document that too?

== Help: verb conjugation symbols meaning. ==

I have noticed on a few verbs with atypical patterns, certain symbols are used at the top of the conjugation box on the word pages. 
Example: –≥–∏–±–Ω—É—Ç—å is represented with "class 3¬∞a[‚ë§]‚ë•" 
I understand "class 3" as being the Zaliznyak classification type shown in the Appendix: Russian Verbs' page. While "a" is the stress patern. 
What do the letters 5 & 6 represent? What patterns are they? And is there a page on them?

I also have a similar question regarding (-o-) as in —Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å. I am assuming it is a stress shift pattern however the details of which I wish I was explained to. [[User:Isaac1901|Isaac1901]] ([[User talk:Isaac1901|talk]]) 03:40, 25 February 2020 (UTC)

== stress of class 2a(or b?) Russian verbs ==

Appendix:Russian verbs notes:

"Stress patterns
Russian verbs have three different stress patterns. These are indicated with Latin letters:

a - the stress is always on the stem.
b - the stress is always on the ending, except when there is no vowel in the ending."

If this is the case then wouldn't class 2a forms such as —Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∞ÃÅ—Ç—å actually hold a variant b accent? 
Unless ‚ü®–æ–≤‚ü©/‚ü®–µ–≤‚ü© and respective declensions ‚ü®—É‚ü©/‚ü®—é‚ü© are considered ultima to stem.

But I usually see, at least in wiktionary ‚àí‚ü®–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å‚ü©/‚àí‚ü®–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å‚ü© represented alongside endings. [[User:Isaac1901|Isaac1901]] ([[User talk:Isaac1901|talk]]) 22:08, 27 February 2020 (UTC)

== Welsh plurals or Welsh noun forms? ==

I've noticed that Welsh plurals are currently split into a [[:Category:Welsh_plurals|plurals category]] and a [[:Category:Welsh_noun_forms|noun forms category]]. Which one is the correct one?

I'm asking because I think the noun form category would be better split into categories for plurals, mutated nouns, and mutated plurals. This would allow more specialised templates than the current {{nowrap|cy-noun-form}} template which does not allow many details to be specified. For instance, for the plural '[[c≈µn]]' {{gloss|dogs}}, {{nowrap|cy-noun-form}} generates:

'''c≈µn'''

I think that it would be more helpful if, for plurals, it could generate something like:

'''c≈µn''' {{g|m-p}}

[[User:EdwardH|EdwardH]] ([[User talk:EdwardH|talk]]) 20:26, 1 February 2014 (UTC)
: Mutation is the same regardless of what part of speech or inflection a word is, isn't it? Then a single [[:Category:Welsh mutated forms]] might be preferable. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:30, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

: The issues of categories and templates are separate: multiple templates can add the same category, and the same template can produce different categories. Categories are a tool for finding entries that have something in common, not for classification. Would people need to look specifically for mutated nouns and mutated plurals? [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 20:59, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

:: No, I doubt they would. In which case, it would probably be better to follow CodeCat's suggestion and create a single mutated form category. [[User:EdwardH|EdwardH]] ([[User talk:EdwardH|talk]]) 09:31, 2 February 2014 (UTC)

If by arrow you mean the short, usually slanted, hyphen-like diacritic known as the [[fatha]], the correct appearance has the [[fatha]] positioned ABOVE the seagull. Unfortunately, since normalization has reversed the order of the compound diacrits (from shadda-fatha to fatha-shadda), most Arabic fonts do not understand it and display it with the seagull on top (which makes it look exactly like shadda-[[kasra]] instead), and some fonts simply overlap them. The [[kasra]] must always be beneath the seagull, and the [[fatha]] must always be above the seagull. Same with double-fatha and double-kasra. [[User:Stephen G.

=== hamzat al-wa·π£l (Ÿ±) and Allah ligature (ŸÑŸÑŸá) ===
I had no problems seeing characters above but I have issues combinning hamzat al-wa·π£l ({{l|ar|Ÿ±}}) and Allah ligature ({{l|ar|ŸÑŸÑŸá}}). The letter {{l|ar|Ÿ±}} is normally unnecessary on individual words were with elidable alif (not pronounced at all if follows a word ending in a vowel) but occasionally it's important to show that it's actually dropped (elided), e.g. in the sentence {{lang|ar|ŸáŸèŸàŸé Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÖŸèÿπŸéŸÑŸêŸëŸÖŸè}} (huwa l-mu øallim(u)), huwa + '''a'''l-mu øallim(u)=huwa l-mu øallim(u). The symbol {{l|ar|Ÿ±}} doesn't seem to work with the ligature {{l|ar|ŸÑŸÑŸá}}. If I write them together: {{lang|ar|Ÿ±ŸÑŸÑŸá}}, the ligature loses shadda and alif hanjariyya (dagger alif) and look simply like lƒÅm+lƒÅm+hƒÅ æ.

== elevated / lofty style ==

What [[:Category:Context labels|context label]] I can use in order to mark the ''elevated style'' or ''lofty style'' in the definition? 

This is interesting for me, because in Russian Wiktionary there is the context label "–≤—ã—Å–æ–∫."

== Chinese character entries in Translingual sections ==

{{movedfrom|Wiktionary talk:Per-language pages proposal#Chinese character entries}}

What is called "Translingual" at present essentially refers to "Chinese", eg. [[‰ª£]], [[Â≠∏]], [[‰ªª]], including glyph etymology, definitions, derived characters (The character is written like that, and various characters are derived from it, because of homophony or near-homophony in ''Chinese''). This bit should be got rid of completely, and Mandarin should be renamed "Chinese" and moved up the top, in which glyph etymology/word etymology/derivations/semantic development etc. are explained (eg.

:::::::: Except that's not always true. No two languages using Chinese characters use the exact same set of characters, with the exact same meaning. There are differences. Furthermore, among the Chinese languages, characters are also tied to historical words. Words with different origins get a different character. That means that when a word falls out of use in one Chinese language, the character that was used to write it goes with it, and it's replaced by another synonymous (!) character. But in another Chinese language, the older word might still be in use and the alternative word could mean something else, or it could be that word that disappeared instead. Thus characters can be very much "dialectal" and have language-specific usage and meanings. For some examples, see [[w:Written Cantonese#Cantonese words]]. It's often said that Chinese is written the same regardless of language, but I'm pretty sure that written Cantonese would not be perfectly understood by a Mandarin speaker, because of these differences. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 01:47, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::Most of the examples in the link above are archaisms, which are perfectly understandable for someone unfamiliar.

:* There's also the etymology of the individual characters, which presumably is specific to the character glyph itself, regardless of the semantics or sound shifts of each language. Some have argued that this belongs under a Chinese heading, but that information is applicable (or at least potentially interesting and linguistically useful) to all languages that use that character. {{unsigned|Eirikr|01:21, 7 February 2014‚Äé}}

:::: That etymology is not translingual if it can not be said to be true for all languages then. The character has essentially the same meaning, '''as in Chinese''', in all of those languages, since those languages kept all the meanings in Sinoxenic compounds. It is in Chinese that the character evolved semantically, and produced those meanings, and the other languages merely borrowed the fossilised characters and compounds. It is not a translingual occurrence that the character was coined, given those meanings, and was used to derive other characters. It was in Chinese that the character was coined, and was assigned the correspondence with a native Chinese word, which evolved semantically through time, acquiring various meanings, and the character was used to write other characters in Chinese. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 01:28, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
:::::@Wyang. No-one argues that Han characters were created by Chinese but character and word definitions become different, they are also different parts of speech across languages (e.g. [[ÁöÑ]] is also a suffix in Japanese and Korean but it's never a suffix in Chinese) and they are shared. Translingual definitions can often be copied into Mandarin to give Mandarin definitions (many Mandarin single character entries still lack simple definitions!) but Translingual (or something with a new name as CodeCat suggested) should stay. Good Chinese and Japanese dictionaries have separate entries for characters and words. Note that translingual sections don't have noun, verb, other parts of speech. The new header, rather than ''Translingual'' may have something to permanently remind that these characters are Chinese, such as ''Han character'' (Êº¢Â≠ó/Ê±âÂ≠ó) if it's your concern but existing subheaders should probably be renamed and standardised (kanjia, hanja, etc.). --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 01:51, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

::::::There is no point in repeating the definitions in Translingual (or whatever the name is) if it is going to be nearly 100% identical with Chinese. There are differences in the PoS across languages, but again I don't agree with the idea of PoS for isolating languages, especially for characters which almost always cover a broad range of PoS in a single sense. Anyway the particle-ilisation of ÁöÑ is a phenomenon which happened in Chinese, which used ÁöÑ to represent an increasingly common possessive and adjectival particle at that time, and Japanese/Korean borrowed this to systematise their Sinoxenic borrowings, converting nouns into something similar to an adjective.

*The retirements of ''mhh'', ''emo'', ''lmm'', ''ggm'' and particularly ''yuu'' all look like good moves.
*We should adopt ''ygs'' as "Yolngu Sign Language" rather than "Yol≈ãu Sign Language", per [[WT:LANG]] (specifically the bits about avoiding special characters and using attested names; "Yolngu Sign Language" is attested, "Yol≈ãu Sign Language" isn't). 
*''gev'' goes by both "Viya" and "Eviya". I'm not sure, but "Viya" may be the better name, as it may be the language's autonym while "Eviya" is the ethnonym.
*It's great to see Old Lithuanian getting a code (''olt''). 
*''xaj'' is a might-be-distinct dialect of the apparently extinct language ''ama'', but whatevs, we can follow the ISO in splitting ''xaj'' off from ''ama''. (Can always merge them back again later if necessary.)
*''gmg'' is apparently a newly discovered language, which is cool.
*''xis'' is the only code I have reservations about. "Kisan" is an ambiguous name, also used by other lects (though that is surmountable, particularly because neither we nor the ISO seem to have granted codes to any of the other lects under that name), and WP says that Kisan and the other major dialect of Kurukh, "Oraon [...] have 73% intelligibility between them".

== A proposal to treat Old Latin as a separate language from the other chronolects of Latin ==

In a short discussion in [[Module talk:labels#Old Latin data]], [[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]] and I agreed that it would be a good idea to treat Old Latin (<samp>la-old</samp>) as a separate language from Latin (<samp>la</samp>) on the English Wiktionary. [[w:Old Latin]] "presents some of the major differences" between Old Latin and Classical Latin. The corpus of Old Latin dates from the fragments of the ''{{w|Carmen Saliare}}'' (700 BC) to the conventional boundary date between it and its Classical descendant language (75 BC). Saliently, much of the earlier Old Latin corpus was unintelligible by the writers of the Classical period; thus, according to the standard linguistic criterion of mutual unintelligibility for differentiating languages, this arguably renders Old Latin and ‚â•Classical Latin different ''[[w:Ausbausprache, Abstandsprache and Dachsprache|Abstandsprachen]]''. Practically speaking, there are more orthographic, phonological, and morphological differences between Old Latin and Classical Latin than there are between Classical Latin and the later Latin chronolects; that Old-Latin‚Äìspecific information can't easily be shoehorned into (Classical) Latin entries without unduly obscuring the information about the language's Classical form, which, I believe, is what most people who look up Latin words will be after. For all these reasons, I propose that we treat Old Latin (loosely defined as everything in the Latin continuum prior to 75 BC, with the ISO code <samp>la-old</samp>) as a separate language from Latin (loosely redefined to exclude everything in the Latin continuum prior to 75 BC, retaining the ISO code <samp>la</samp>) on the English Wiktionary.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 19:25, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

: The proposal to treat Old Latin as a separate language sounds good to me, too; in the past, [[User:Metaknowledge]] [[WT:T:ALA#Old_Latin_inscriptions|explained]] the dramatic differences between Old and newer Latin to me. <br>I do have a technical question, though: I don't mean to nitpick, but ''is'' "la-old" an ISO code? If it isn't, but we still want to upgrade "Old Latin" from "etymology-only language" to "regular / L2-having language", shouldn't we create an exceptional code the way we usually do (as documented on [[WT:LANG]] and demonstrated in [[Module:languages/datax]]), which is by using the family code, a hyphen, and three letters that approximate the language's name (so: "itc-ola")? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 20:49, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

:::::: Based on the discussion that -sche linked to, I don't think we should split off Old Latin at 75 BC.

::::::: I think instead of using a particular date, we can use a particular progression of sound changes. That would simplify things for us, because we can limit how many alternative forms and inflections we need to handle. Obvious choices would be s > r, weakening of unstressed vowels, monophthongisation, loss of final -d, and maybe even the stress shift itself (if we can somehow find out when it happened). (Speaking about codes I noticed we have <code>roa-ptg</code> for Old Portuguese. Maybe we should change that to <code>roa-opt</code>?) {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:01, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
::::::::This looks more sensible to me. Otherwise, we would have to create an Old Latin section for every word that occurs in [[w:Terence|Terence]]'s works (for example), which wouldn't make much sense. A sentence as ''non dici potest quam cupida eram huc redeundi, abeundi a milite vosque hic videndi, antiqua ut consuetudine agitarem inter vos libere convivium'' doesn't present "striking differences" from Ciceronian Latin. --[[User:Fsojic|Fsojic]] ([[User talk:Fsojic|talk]]) 00:20, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
::::::::: Is Cicero's Latin what is normally used as the "base" for classical Latin? If so, then anything less than 100 years before his writing probably is similar enough to our idea of "Latin" to call it that. It's more practical to look at spelling, that's why I think sound changes give a better cutoff, because of how they influence spelling. [[w:Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]] from 186 BC is a good example of a text I would consider "old" but not "really old". It has the weakening of unstressed vowels, and probably the classical stress pattern as well, but it still has diphthongs which make quite a lot of words look rather different, final -d in the ablative, DV rather than B, GN rather than N, and a few other things. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:41, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::Yes, Cicero and Caesar are the base for it. --[[User:Fsojic|Fsojic]] ([[User talk:Fsojic|talk]]) 13:00, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
: I've made the change. I don't know if I caught all the cases that used "OL.", so there might be a module error or two. We'll need to keep an eye out. A lot of links to Old Latin terms use "la" as the code too, so we need to look out for those and update them. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:38, 14 February 2014 (UTC)

== rare terms ==

(I think this has already been discussed before, but I couldn't find where)

I did [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=coquetisme&diff=25490306&oldid=25484808 this edit], but I'm not satisfied with the categorization it brings about. This is not a "term with a rare sense" (which would imply it had several senses), it's ''only'' a "rare term". --[[User:Fsojic|Fsojic]] ([[User talk:Fsojic|talk]]) 23:54, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
: A rare term is a term, all of whose senses are rare. Therefore, a "rare term" is also a "term with a rare sense". There isn't much use for a category of terms that ''only'' have rare senses. And it would also be very difficult to implement context labels in a way that would support that. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 00:02, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
:: From a technical perspective it'd be simple to have {{temp|cx|rare term}} vs {{temp|cx|rare sense}}. But getting people to use the labels correctly could indeed be difficult, in part because some people would probably continue to use {{temp|cx|rare}} for both cases even if we deprecated it or made it a redirect to only one of the two. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 03:44, 8 February 2014 (UTC)

:You're right that this has been discussed before, and some users have taken the same view as you, that "terms with rare senses" misleadingly implies that some senses are not rare. Others have taken the view that it doesn't explicitly ''say'' any sense are not rare, and so is more palatable than the former category ("rare terms", which nevertheless contained common terms with rare senses). Here are a few past discussions: [[WT:RFM#Category:English_terms_with_obsolete_senses]], [[WT:Grease pit/2011/June#Bad_category_name_generated_by_template_obsolete]], [[WT:Beer parlour/2011/June#English_terms_with_obsolete_senses.2C_etc.]]. In general, the way we handle rare/obsolete/etc terms, terms with rare/obsolete senses{{,}} and rare/obsolete forms is a mess, because we mix all of those things incompletely. For example, some entries use <samp><nowiki>{{cx|obsolete|lang=en}} {{alternative form of|foo|lang=en}}</nowiki></samp> while others use <samp><nowiki>{{obsolete form of|foobar|lang=en}}</nowiki></samp> ‚Äî and that's not even necessarily wrong, because some have argued that there is a meaningful difference between the two.

== <samp>{&#x7B;[[Template:head|head]]&#x7D;}</samp>'s links to e.g. [[Wiktionary:Hebrew transliteration]] ==

Currently, {{temp|head}} prefaces the headword's transliteration with a bullet symbol linking to e.g. [[Wiktionary:Hebrew transliteration]]. I think I understand the motivation here, but I think the result is not quite right, for four reasons:

* Pages in the <samp>Wiktionary:</samp> (<samp>Project:</samp>) namespace aren't part of our actual dictionary content: they're supposed to be for editors, not readers. If we want to document our transliteration schemes for readers, then we should do so in the <samp>Appendix:</samp> namespace.
* I've looked through [[Wiktionary:Hebrew transliteration]] and several others, and in all cases, it's clear that they were written for use by editors who know the original script and want to write a transliteration. That means that they're categorically not useful to put between the original script and the transliteration when both are present. (If anything, that information would be useful when the transliteration is ''missing'', if we want to prompt readers to become editors and add it.)
* I can't think of what ''would'' be given in reader-oriented documentation of a transliteration scheme. I suppose it would give information about how to go from a transliteration to a pronunciation, but in that case it seems like {{temp|head}} is one of the least useful places for the link, since the headword is already likely to have an associated ===Pronunciation=== section. (I don't feel strongly about this part, though.)
* It's really not obvious that the bullet symbol is a link; and even if someone notices the color and correctly infers that it's a link, they're not likely to guess what it's a link ''to'', since it doesn't seem closely tied to the transliteration. (The transliteration is wrapped in parentheses, and the bullet is outside those parentheses, so the link actually closer to the original script than to the transliteration.)

I think it might be best to just remove the link, but an alternative would be to (1) change it to point to an appendix rather than a project page and (2) move it after the transliteration, inside the parentheses, as something like <code><nowiki><sup>''[[Appendix:Hebrew transliteration|help]]''</sup></nowiki></code>.

: After thinking about it, you do have a point. But I have to point out that not everything on Wiktionary is only for "readers". In fact, the idea of a wiki is that all "readers" are also potential editors. The "[edit]" links, for example, also do nothing to help readers. On the other hand, the link does not help a reader add a missing transliteration since it does not appear when the transliteration is missing. And I agree that it wouldn't be the end of the world if we simply got rid of the link altogether. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 06:18, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

== When is English not English? ==

I've noticed that "Gorsedd" is described as an English word, and its etymology is shown as "from Welsh"; similarly "satyagraha" is categorised as "English, derived from Sanskrit", although it seems to me that Gorsedd is simply a Welsh word denoting a Welsh institution, and Satyagraha is a Sanskrit word denoting a Hindu concept. 

What is the reasoning behind this? Any language can borrow and eventually absorb foreign words, but if a word becomes English as soon as it is used in an English sentence, then every word in the world could be categorised as English! 

For heaven's sake, we English-speakers are insular enough already!{{unsigned|Hoffoholi}}

:Good question. English has a mechanism for indicating a word as foreign: italics. Thus, if a well-edited book (which italicizes foreign words) uses a word without italics, it's using that word as English. As Michael&nbsp;Z. notes, we use those citations to determine whether the word should be listed as English in the dictionary. On the other hand, on Usenet, for example, where (at least traditionally) italics aren't used, it's hard to show whether a word ''would'' be in italics were the medium conducive to it, so citations from Usenet that show use of a traditionally foreign in English are not useful in determining whether the word is English or not.<span class="Unicode">&#x200b;‚Äî[[User:Msh210|msh210]]‚Ñ†</span> ([[user talk:Msh210|talk]]) 16:13, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

== <s>Proposal for [[Template:ttbc]] to accept unrecognized language names</s> ==

Inspired by recent edits to [[[[ostrich]]]], I think {{temp|ttbc}} should accept unrecognized language names. Not all users know all of our language name conventions and I think we should allow translations to be added such as "<samp><nowiki>{{ttbc|Sami}}: [[struhcca]]</nowiki></samp>" when the specific Sami lect is unknown. It would presumably categorize separately to something like [[:Category:Translations to be checked (language unknown)]]. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 13:46, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

== Template to format quotations ==

Currently we only have {{temp|usex}} to format quotations and usage examples alike. [[User:Angr]] said that there might be objections against using {{temp|usex}} for quotations, but I'm not sure why exactly. Either way, we don't really have a template that can format quotations properly the way [[WT:QUOTE]] describes it. So I think that we should add parameters to {{temp|usex}} that allow us to show sourcing information. We could also make a dedicated template like {{temp|quote}}, {{temp|quotation}} or something similar, but I'm not sure what the benefit of having a separate template would be over extending an existing one. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:58, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

: We have at least 3 different templates to format quotations ({{temp|Q}}, {{temp|quote-book}}, {{temp|reference-book}}). The benefit is, having separate templates allows us to easily distinguish between quotations that we made up from quotations that actually occur in the wild. That's not to say that both templates couldn't use the same back end- but they should absolutely be kept separate in entries. [[User:DTLHS|DTLHS]] ([[User talk:DTLHS|talk]]) 21:02, 11 February 2014 (UTC)
:: Yes, but they are mainly for formatting the citation line of the quotation, not the quotation itself. In fact {{temp|quote-book}} is very bad at formatting the quotation itself for any language that doesn't use the Latin script. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:04, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

==Why are quotations hidden?==
Currently we have a script that auto-hides quotations in a collapsible box, but I don't really know the reasoning behind this. I consider quotations to be a type of usage example; one taken from existing citations instead of made up on the spot. So I don't think quotations should be hidden, just like we don't hide usage examples that aren't quotations. If the size of the text is a concern, then we could decide to hide only that part of the quotation that is not also part of the usage example. Then again, usage examples the way they're produced by {{temp|usex}} can become quite long too; they can have text, transliteration, transthat's 3 lines already. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:58, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

:: Then why not just choose a shorter one? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:12, 11 February 2014 (UTC)
::: Because sometimes we don't have a large number of attestations to pick and choose from, and sometimes you need some context to demonstrate the meaning you're attesting.

:::::::@CodeCat: This seems so obvious. Usexes are brief and usually serve to orient the user at least as well as the definitions. Quotations have all the overhead of sources, dates, titles, etc. and may be present only for purposes of attestation. Putting them on the Citations pages just makes them a little harder to get to and runs the risk of losing the connection with specific senses for polysemic terms. As anyone who cites entries knows, we do not live in a world in which there are citations good for all usage example purposes and for all attestation purposes, especially not for every sense of every polysemic term.

:::::::: Usage examples don't have to be brief, because quotations are an example of usage examples that are not always brief. And like Wikitiki said, sometimes you need a lengthy example to show the meaning, whether it's quoted or made up is not relevant then. I don't understand your point about Citations pages. Is "being hard to get to" is a reason for making our entries less accessible to the average user? Usage examples (and therefore also quotations) should serve the purpose of illustrating usage to normal users who want to know what the word means and how to use it. They're not there to quench the curiosity of the few users who are more interested in the documented historical record, because that's a minor use case that isn't really relevant to knowing what the word ''means''. Documenting usage is what citations pages are for, and have always been for. If they're not good enough for their their intended purpose, then fix them where they are, rather than having the problem spill over into the entries themselves where they affect a lot more of our users. Keep citations on the citation pages, keep usage examples with the senses. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:58, 11 February 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::I guess I fail to see what the harm is here. We have usexes to give the reader an at-a-glance feel for the word, how it's used, what it means, etc. We have quotations to demonstrate real usage, track the word's journey through time, etc. Quotations are simply bigger, and of less interest to the general user, but at the same time utterly indispensable to someone who really wants to drill in. It seems to me that the only argument you've offered in support of the assertion that anything's wrong is that it irks you in some vague way, which seems to me as insufficient impetus to make a major change to our presentation. -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|ŒªŒ¨ŒªŒµŒπ ·ºêŒºŒøŒØ]]</small> 22:14, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

:::::Notwithstanding CodeCat's apparent desire to conflate contributor-authored usage examples and published quotations by eliminating the distinct names of ''usage examples'' and''quotations'' (or ''citations''), it is very useful to shun her idiolect and maintain the names and the distinction made in Wiktionary discussions and in the current use of the word "quotations" in the control to allow or suppress display of quotations. The distinction is particularly meaningful for Wiktionary because "quotations" count for attestation and "usage examples" do not.
:::::@Darkdadaah: I don't think we actually have any instances of more than half a dozen usage examples. Certain English function words have so many.

=== Should quotations be normalized? ===
The quotations rules are too strict, IMHO, especially for foreign languages. The photographic image in quotations of the original text + transliteration may even be misleading for some language learners with less than native/advanced knowledge of a language, e.g. Russian words with letter "[[—ë]]" are spelled with "[[–µ]]", Arabic text may lack [[hamza]] or "[[Ÿä]]" written as "[[Ÿâ]]", word stresses are missing, the original orthography may be imperfect, dated or even wrong. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 22:49, 11 February 2014 (UTC)

:@Anatoli, re "the original orthography may be imperfect, dated or even wrong": de.Wikt routinely normalises quotations for this reason. I don't necessarily agree with that practice, but I recognise that even en.Wikt normalises quotations quite a bit (e.g., we don't reproduce books' use of different font colours, and we don't often reproduce their use of different font sizes or fonts (Fraktur vs Antiqua), and if they are Latin-script, we don't reproduce their use of obsolete ligatures).

So of course if the original author included stress marks, such as in your textbook for foreigners example, then there is no problem. But if the original author did not include stress marks, then for all you know he could have intended "–¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã" to be mispronounced as "–¥–æ–∫—ÉÃÅ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã". --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 06:33, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

: The so-called quotation in [[–æ–Ω–µ]] implies that Pushkin wrote ‚Äú–æ–Ω–µÃÅ‚Äù. But in fact he wrote ‚Äú–æ–Ω—£‚Äù, the Bolsheviks melted down the —£ types decades later, so some book printed ‚Äú–æ–Ω–µ‚Äù, and then a Wiktionary editor enhanced the quotation by indicating stress to yield ‚Äú–æ–Ω–µÃÅ‚Äù. Here is a quotation ''whose purpose is to demonstrate usage'', showing 21st-century schoolbook style, with no date, and the title of an 1831 publication. Changing quotations and leaving out accurate citations lacks integrity and is poor academic practice. It is also against our guidelines.

:::* I must agree with Michael to some extent that a quotation should be a faithful quote -- no editing, no spelling fixes.
:::: That said, to provide another (hopefully useful) point on the graph, when I dig up old Japanese for quotation purposes, I try to find the original rendering. For quotes from the [[w:Man'y≈çsh≈´]], for instance, this is entirely in kanji, using different kanji from most modern usage, and with no kana at all. I then make use of extra lines to give 1) a transliteration into kana, 2) a transliteration into the Latin alphabet, and 3) a translation into modern English. See [[[[È∂¥#Noun]]]] or [[[[Áâô#Noun]]]] for two such examples.
:::: For quotations in other languages, if desirable, I would support the addition of an extra line just below the quote itself to provide a modernized rendering of the quote. And if the quote in question is in a non-Latin script, I would also strongly recommend that we add a transliteration into the Latin alphabet, if at all possible. 
:::: With regard to WikiTiki's point, I think what Michael objects to is wikieditors altering quotes. Shakespearean terms can be found in published works in many different forms, so choosing one such published example should suffice. What I would certainly object to would be finding a quote and then altering it yourself as you type it in here to change spelling or diacritics, etc. If needed for clarity, add the altered version ''after'' the quotation, but not ''as'' the quotation. &#8209;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 01:04, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

::::::: To reiterate (and hopefully clarify), I feel quite strongly that the main line of the quotation should give the text '''as-is from the published work.''' If the published work has typos, misspellings, non-standard orthography, missing vowel points, etc., that should be ''faithfully reproduced'' in the main line of the quotation. Since such oddities may indeed be difficult for users to read, I also feel quite strongly that we (wikieditors) should have the option of ''also including a second line'' just beneath the quotation, wherein we can give reading assistance -- kana, diacritics, modern spellings, stress markers, what have you. And if the quotation is in a non-Latin script, we should then give a transliteration into the Latin alphabet, followed finally by the translation.
::::::: If an editor doesn't like the format of a quotation (in terms of missing diacritics, obsolete spellings, etc.), they have the option of finding a published work that provides the quotation without such shortcomings -- so long as we are sourcing from a published work (and appropriately referencing / pointing to that work), I think we're fine. For example, if we can find a published Qur'an that includes the vowels and other diacritics, we can choose to use that version, so long as we reference it. Quoting the Qur'an with vowels and diacritics, but referencing a version that doesn't have those, sounds to me like an error.

== Arabic script for [[w:Dungan language]]? ==

I ran into [[:Category:Dungan terms needing native script]] in [[Special:WantedCategories]], and started to create it. Then I noticed that both members were already in Cyrillic, which we treat as the only script for the language. Further digging turned up the fact that it was originally written in a Perso-Arabic-based script referred to by its Chinese name of [[w:Xiao'erjing]], but that Soviet Union required speakers to switch to Cyrillic (with a Roman alphabet in between). The {{temp|rfscript|sc=Arab}} was added by [[User:Hippietrail]], so it was a serious request- not the work of some POV-pushing islamist IP.

I think we should add it as a secondary script, but the question is: does our infrastructure associated with the Arab script code cover Dungan Xiao'erjing (apparently truly alphabetic) adequately, or do we need to create a separate script code? [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 00:42, 17 February 2014 (UTC)

Our aim is to include all words in all languages, but also from all of their stages. So before and after every spelling reform, writing system change, etc. We did already have at least one or two Dungan terms in Arabic script before I added these requests.

== Suggestions for Chinese tone contour categories ==

I'm going to start adding categories for "tone contours" for multi-character Chinese terms. I'd like to hear some opinions from other contributors.

By tone contours I mean grouping together all two-character words that have rising tone for the first character and falling tone for the second character, etc.

The obvious name for the categories is "Chinese tone contours "2-4" etc. But maybe there are better ideas.

Tone symbols could be used but that would only make it trickier to enter and use and the tone numbers are widely used and understood, and the method will work for other tone languages that use tone numbers.

The second issue is the neutral tone. Would "5" or "0" be preferred? I always liked "0" better, but "5" seems more popular.

A third issue is whether to group or separate traditional and simplified. I prefer to have just one category and the trad. and simp. forms should sort next to each other anyway. But for that would we need to include explicit sort information?

The worst issue though might be tone sandhi. The point of these categories is to help learners with tones. Most learners can reproduce correct tones in isolated syllables but even many fluent foreign speakers of Chinese end up with very flat tones in continuous speech. So I have been told both by native speaking friends and advanced learners.

So it seems that to make the category most useful for this purpose we should categorize by tones after sandhi. But to fit in with how we and other dictionaries generally treat tone sandhi we should categorize by tones before sandhi.

Maybe a compromise is to categorize by tones before sandhi and explain the process in the cat. boiler and link to any other categories which would end up with the same tone contour after sandhi.

So let's hear other people's thoughts. &mdash; [[User:Hippietrail|hippietrail]] ([[User talk:Hippietrail|talk]]) 01:53, 18 February 2014 (UTC)
: I think the information about what the pre- and post-sandhi tones are is best covered in the entries themselves. Categories would be most useful to link those that have the same pattern of change in the tones: 33->23 or whatever.

:I don't like this idea. Wiktionary is a dictionary, not a language textbook. There is no [[:Category:English words with counterintuitive pronunciations]], [[:Category:English pronunciations containing Œ∏]], or [[:Category:English words with dark l]]. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 08:37, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

::Yes but you don't like many established features of Wiktionary. Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's a dictionary with lots more stuff in it than in some other dictionaries. This would be a type of index or appendix and Chinese dictionaries already have several kinds of indices and appendices that English dictionaries don't use. I could easily list three categories I personally don't like too. But that would be a separate discussion. And like any feature I don't care for I don't use those and don't contribute to those. Simple.
::By the way I don't think any of your examples are bad ideas for categories. Certainly no worse than some categories I've seen and probably useful to some people. &mdash; [[User:Hippietrail|hippietrail]] ([[User talk:Hippietrail|talk]]) 09:58, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

:::The fact that I don't like many of the current practices doesn't mean my viewpoint should be viewed as more likely to be ridiculous than other people's. How much benefit will be gained by language learners from the existence of these categories, considering less than 5% of the current entries actually have audio samples? Wouldn't it be immeasurably easier for learners to resort to actual audio material elsewhere to get a feel for the native intonations than to look at these categories trying to figure out which tonal contour group a word belongs to? Who is going to be populating these categories with the 30000+ currently existing entries and who will be maintaining them, and how? Do these apply to disyllabic combinations only or do they apply to other multisyllabic combinations too (>4*5*5=100 possibilities for trisyllabic, >4*5*5*5=500 possibilities for tetrasyllabic)? Is the categorisation "Words with the tonal contour 4-1-3-2" meaningful? What about other Chinese varieties, eg. Min Nan (>8*8*8=512 trisyllabic for Taiwanese), or Cantonese (>9*9=81 disyllabic, >9*9*9=729 trisyllabic), especially ones with drastically different mechanisms of tone sandhi from Beijing Mandarin (eg. Min Nan, Shanghainese)? I don't mean to be picky but here are just some complications associated with such categorisations, which are the reasons I disliked this idea. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 10:22, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

::::I suspect you never had to learn Chinese as an adult so you can only make guess at what is easy or difficult or useful. You're not the target audience so don't need to be annoyed with a feature you would never need or use.
::::Quoting what's missing only tells us what can be improved. We don't have enough audio. It's not directly relevant. One thing is that only native or very good speakers can contribute audio whereas anybody with some resources can contribute to the suggested categories. It could perhaps be that because native speakers wouldn't benefit from audio that they don't feel compelled to put the effort into creating them. I can point at any number of fluent nonnative speakers with very poor tones who had audio materials but didn't get a feel for the native intonations in polysyllabic words. Because the materials don't abstract the contours.
::::That fact that you imagine learners looking at categories trying to make guesses who how hard it is far a native speaker who has native intuition of tones to imagine the difficult learning process of a foreign learner. This is not what they'd do at all. They would look at the category, find some terms they recognize or think are useful, then ask somebody to say each of them to try to tone their ear to their shared aspect, the tone contours.
::::Can you point to a resource elsewhere which groups audio resources by tone contours? I agree that would be very useful indeed. I haven't been able to find one.
::::Open source is populated by people with an itch to scratch. People who are interested in populating the categories populate them, just like everything else on Wiktionary was created. You don't have to do any of it.
::::It would apply to any Mandarin terms of more than one syllable. Calculating numbers of combinations and permutations doesn't illustrate the futility of a category any more than you could do the same to illustrate the futility of attempting any kind of open source / data project. You could've used such an argument to illustrate that nobody would create Wiktionary or Wikipedia. It would've been wrong. There don't need to be categories for every possible sequence of tones because not all possible sequences are in use. Just as we don't have entries for pinyin syllables which are not in use.
::::If anybody wants to create similar categories for another sinitic or another tonal language I would support them. If nobody wants to create them, nobody will create them. There is no problem.
::::Another aspect of the supposed combinatorics problem is that it would be quite an easy project for a bot, if it were to capture anybody's attention. &mdash; [[User:Hippietrail|hippietrail]] ([[User talk:Hippietrail|talk]]) 12:04, 18 February 2014 (UTC)
::::: Instead of categories, why not create appendices? A link of the appropriate appendix could be added to the actual entry under the See also header. While I like categorization, unfortunately, categories do not show up in the mobile view. A bot could monitor the appendices to make sure that the appendix items and the actual entries are in sync. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 13:40, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

:::::: Yes I intended to fall back to indices if there was substatial objection to categories. Categories are generally better though because they do some of the work for you and work in a uniform manner.
:::::: It could be a good policy to not allow new categores that have not first been implemented and approved as indices though. And perhaps not even allow new public indices until they have first been implemented and approved as private indices.
:::::: As for category support lacking in the mobile app, that is disappointing to hear. But forcing people not to implement features because implementations are lacking is a bit like refusing to buy a smartphone because they don't have good Wiktionary apps. The correct approach is to use the better features and push to have implementations support them. See if there's a bug report to watch, or if not then file a bug report.

The following tables are excerpted from the article on the {{w|zh:Â§©Ê¥•Ë©±|Tianjin dialect}} in Chinese Wikipedia I wrote a while ago, which is spoken ~100 km east of Beijing and which is characterised by distinctly different tonal values and tone sandhi patterns from Beijing Mandarin. The Beijing dialect is much simpler than this. I think the amount of information contained within these tables (at most, with in-table audios and examples in Table 2) is optimal for appendix content for tone sandhi patterns on Wiktionary, if it is to exist.

== Pre-Roman substratum language code nargery ==

Following up on [[WT:Beer parlour/2013/December#.22Proper.22_codes_for_etymology-only_languages|a question I posed last year]]: should ''und-ibe'' ("pre-Roman (Iberia)") and ''und-bal'' ("pre-Roman (Balkans)") be moved from [[Module:languages/datax]] to [[Module:etymology language/data]]? [[Module:languages]] is for languages that are allowed entries (whether in the main namespace or in appendices); [[Module:etymology language]] is for lects that are only mentioned in etymologies and are not allowed entries. Given that both ''und-ibe'' and ''und-bal'' potentially represent multiple unrelated languages, would it ever be appropriate to have entries/appendices in either? If so, then I guess they should stay in [[Module:languages]]; if not, then it seems like they should be moved to [[Module:etymology language]]. "Pre-Greek", which seems conceptually related, is in [[Module:etymology language]]. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:06, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. Incidentally, is it possible to make these codes categorise as ''pre-Roman (foo)'' but only display ''pre-Roman''? ‚Äî ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|falai]])</sup>'' 23:19, 24 February 2014 (UTC)

::I've moved the codes.<br> I don't think there is a way, within the current framework, to make pages display one name and categorise using another. Besides, so long as we consider "pre-Roman (Iberia)" and "pre-Roman (Balkans)" separate enough to warrant separate codes and categories, I think that it's appropriate that they also display distinct names. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 07:06, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

:::Semi-related. Has the question of a '''general''' pre-Ide. category ever been brought up (i.e., not paleo-Balkan or pre-Itallic but a general category usable for whole of Europe)? I think I searched for this a while ago but didn't come up with any discussions. At present there are a couple of entries with a (''referenced'') proposed pre-Ide. etymology ({{m|lv|zaƒ∑is}} is one that I recall). I could potentially have one Livonian entry with a detailed reference ultimately tracing it to a possible pre-Ide. substratum (via Curonian though) and I'd love to have it classified as such.

:::Pre-Ide. is notorious for attracting pseudo-science but since such a category would have maybe a couple dozen items ''at most'' I think it would be pretty easy to check it for offenders and ax them on sight.

As I commented in a previous thread, we should perhaps develop a naming scheme for these codes, though; you'll notice how variant the codes currently are. Perhaps "pre-grc", "pre-ine", "pre-rib" (pre-Roman (Iberia)) and pre-rbk (pre-Roman (Balkans))? Or perhaps three-part codes are in order, "sub-pre-grc", "sub-pre-ine", "sub-pre-ibe", "sub-pre-bal"?

Yes, -sche, that is exactly what I'm thinking ‚Äì pre-ine as a "[[hypernym]]" to the already existing pre-Itallic and pre-Balkan. Would be great if that could be added.

The ISO had granted separate codes to "Upper Tanudan Kalinga" (''kgh'') and "Lower Tanudan Kalinga" (''kml''), but in 2012 they merged them into ''kml'' as "Tanudan Kalinga" and retired the code ''kgh''. I suggest we follow suit. (Kalinga is a dialect continuum; we could consider merging even more Kalingas later.) [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 06:09, 20 February 2014 (UTC)

In 2012, the ISO retired ''gbc'' (the code they had used for this language), splitting it into ''wrk'' for Garawa proper (which they call by the less common name "Garrwa", and which also goes by "Karawa") and ''wny'' for Wanyi (also spelt "Wanji", "Waanyi"). Garawa and Wanyi are closely related, but enough scholarly literature distinguishes them that I think we should follow the ISO in splitting them.

Quoth WP, "McConvell suspects Karrangpurru was a dialect of Mudburra because people said it was similar. However, it is undocumented and thus formally unclassifiable." If that was the basis for incorporating it into Mudburra, I suppose we should follow the ISO in making the split.

Djiwarli and Thiin are closely related; they and two other lects are sometimes considered to form the dialect continuum {{w|Mantharta language|Mantharta}}. WP says the varieties (all extinct) "were distinct but largely mutually intelligible". We could either make the split, or not, or go as far as to not only keep Thiin and Jiwarli unified but also unify Mantharta's other two dialects, ''dhr'' (Dhargari) and ''wri'' (Warriyangga).

They retired ''ggm'' a year later upon realizing that it was not a specific language but rather a cover term for various languages. I can't find evidence of Ikarranggal, either. I suggest we go along with the recoding of Aghu Tharnggalu as ''gtu'' (there being no reason to continue using a retired code when an up-to-date one exists for the same language).

== Phase out the synonyms of {{temp|a|GenAm}} and {{temp|a|RP}} (namely {{temp|a|US}} and {{temp|a|UK}}) ==

For a long time, we have tolerated {{temp|a|US}} as a synonym of {{temp|a|GenAm}} and of {{temp|a|UK}} as a synonym of {{temp|a|RP}}. [[WT:Tea room/2014/February#ma.27am|This discussion in the Tea Room]] is the latest in a long line of discussions that have made clear how misleading this is: the labels "US" and "UK" seem to cover the entireties of those countries, yet we use them only for very specific accents. I propose that we have a bot replace all instances of {{temp|a|US}} with {{temp|a|GenAm}}, and all instances of {{temp|a|UK}} with {{temp|a|RP}}. Alternatively, if we wanted to check all uses of "US" and "UK" to ensure they were not being used in ways other than as synonyms of "GenAm" and "RP" (out of our 3.5 million pages, I did see one once that used both "US" and "GenAm"), we could simply change it so that "US" ''displayed'' "GenAm" and "UK" ''displayed'' "RP". Then, at our leisure, we could go through all the occurrences of those templates, checking them by hand; furthermore, they would still exist as redirects for editors to use, without misleading readers by displaying text that implied they covered all of the US and UK, respectively. Thoughts? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:34, 24 February 2014 (UTC)

::To me it looks like yet another way of driving away normal users and making it a dictionary of little use to any but the kind of folks who contribute here. I would have thought that the right direction is precisely the opposite, with links and footnotes to explain the relationship of the instantly understandable and the 'accurate enough' "US" and "UK" labels to the technically precise and very impressive looking 'General American' and 'Received Pronunciation', which the those not students of language don't instantly understand. That a casual user will follow links goes against our experience and against human nature. To assume that they will or should is fully in accord with our practice and with human nature, but nonetheless wrong.

If we're expecting users to click through to find stuff (an assumption that is often flawed, as any longer observation of [[WT:Feedback]] will confirm), then why not put the extended explanation that "In this context, the label 'UK' refers to the ''received pronunciation'' common in Britain," etc., on the linked page?

::::: From my perspective, "UK" is a more obtuse label than "RP", because contrary to your notion, RP is not common in the UK. Someone noted in the Tea Room the statistic from {{w|Peter Trudgill}} that it's used by only 3% of the population. The fact that all (or, see below, almost all) of our entries use "UK" to gloss RP pronunciations is thus obtuse ("intellectually dim-witted", "indirect or circuitous") ‚Äî neither "accurate" nor "accurate enough". It needs to change regardless of whether our goal is to stop misleading our readers the way we currently do, or start misleading them in some new way (like by using "UK" to gloss some never-used "conflation pronunciation"/"abstraction" of Cockney ''plus'' RP ''plus'' Scottish ''plus'' Estuary ''plus'' Northern Irish ''plus'' Welsh, as proposed below).

*:: Re pronunciation of ''cannot'': In my experience it is more common in the US to put the stress on the second syllable, thereby reducing the first vowel.

*::: If the first syllable is reduced, wouldn't it just be a schwa? […™] is commonly an allophone of /…ô/, but then it shouldn't be in broad transcriptions (since it doesn't contrast with a schwa)... [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 01:38, 25 February 2014 (UTC)
*:::: There's a lot more to it than that. Since I have not actually done research on this, I will give examples from my idiolect. In my idiolect (and I believe this to be common in America and perhaps worldwide), the velars /k/ and /…°/ are palatalized by back vowels (everything from /iÀê/ to /√¶/, and even by /a ä/, which is realized closer to [√¶ ä], but ''not'' by /a…™/). In my idiolect, the /k…ô/ in [[caboose]] (/k…ôÀàbuÀês/) is contrasted with the /k…™/ in [[kibbutz]] (/k…™ÀàbuÀêts/) and this distinction is very noticeable due to the palatalization of in ''kibbutz'' and lack of palatalization in ''caboose''. Since the unreduced vowel after /k/ in ''cannot'' is /√¶/, which palatalizes, it is reduced to the palatalizing /…™/ rather than the unpalatalizing /…ô/. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 01:52, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

*::: Given that "US" = "GenAm" has been the case since long before I started editing, I imagine that fewer entries use "US" to mean something other than "GenAm" than use {{temp|head|foo|adjective}} under a ===Noun=== header. Which is to say, there are certainly [[WT:TODO#Mismatched_POS|a few of our 3.5 million entries that do]], but they're not standard (and there's no way to know if the way they do use "US" is the way you want to start using it).

*::::::: Phonetic transcriptions attempt to transcribe the actual sound speakers articulate. Phonemic transcriptions abstract from that and describe only the features that contrast within a particular speaker's dialect. So each dialect has its own set of phonemes. Diaphonemic transcriptions go further still, and try to describe correspondences between the phonemes of speakers across many dialects. So for example a diaphonemic description of English would acknowledge that /…ô ä/, /a ä/, /…õ ä/ and so on are all different manifestations of the same underlying diaphonemic unit, depending on dialect. Diaphonemic transcriptions do not describe ''sounds'', therefore, but ''correspondence sets'', and are not all that different from correspondence sets used in historical linguistics; in a sense, they are a synchronic proto-language. Diaphonemic transcription sometimes runs into problems when it's not just the realisations of phonemes that change, but also the different phonemic contrasts (the many splits/mergers in English for example). In cases like that, usually the contrast is maintained in the transcription if it's made in at least some of the dialects. For English, that would mean that if we include Scottish English as part of the English diaphonemic system, then /x/ is an English diaphoneme separate from /k/, and there will also be contrasts among vowels that the majority of English speakers don't distinguish. Diaphonemic systems become progressively more abstract as you include more dialects, because by necessity that means digging further back into the history of the language to the point of departure between various dialects. For the British-vs-American split, that still lies in the modern period, but for many dialects within Britain itself, the splits may be Middle or even Old English in origin. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:24, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

== Entries for Japanese verb forms? ==

It seems like there's some demand for entries for Japanese verb forms. Somewhere down the years, I wound up with the impression that verb forms for Japanese were not to be added. More recently, I've been over [[WT:AJA]] and [[WT:ELE]] and I don't see any policy text stating that we shouldn't create these. Moreover, we do have entries for verb forms for numerous other languages.

Would any other editors have strong feelings in opposition to the creation of verb form entries for Japanese? If so, why? &#8209;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 22:49, 24 February 2014 (UTC)

:I think it is probably about creating verb forms for agglutinative languages in general. [[User:Wyang|Wyang]] ([[User talk:Wyang|talk]]) 01:17, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

::Personally, I support creating entries for a few basic verb forms, as given in the tables. I suppose it can be difficult to draw the line, but that would be for the Japanese editors to decide. As a beginner, I initially found it difficult to guess the lemma form correctly, and although I already find that I am not in need of this, I can certainly see how it would have been useful. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 08:32, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

::: I '''strongly support''' the addition of Japanese verb forms. My Japanese is poor, so I'm not aware of how many verb forms any given verb can have. That said, I offer a Latin verb for comparison: Consider {{m|la|scƒ´sc≈ç}}. It has 104 non-participial conjugated forms and four participles; its present active participle, future active participle, perfect passive participle, and future passive participle themselves inflect, the p.a.p. having 24 declined forms and the other three participles 36 declined forms each. That means that the one verb {{m|la||scƒ´sc≈ç}} has 236 verb forms or forms of verb forms, all of which get entries; of course, not all of those forms are heteromorphic, so fewer than 236 pages are affected by it, but you get some idea by this of the extent of Latin conjugation. Even if Japanese verbs end up with a comparable number of conjugated forms, I still don't see what the problem is.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[[User:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|I.S.]][[User talk:I'm so meta even this acronym#NO BOLD|M.E.T.A.]] 17:00, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

=== Entries for Japanese adjective forms? ===

* [[Image:Arrowred.png|15px]] If the community is accepting of verb form entries, we might need a new header template.
: Regular verb forms take a <code>===Verb===</code> header, followed by a template such as {{temp|ja-verb form}}, and then the definition line containing the inflected verb form, a description of how it is inflected, and a link to the lemma.
: Japanese also has a class of term generally described as an ''adjective'' in English, or more specifically as an '''''i'''-adjective'' for English-speaking learners of Japanese, or as a {{m|ja|ÂΩ¢ÂÆπË©û|tr=keiy≈çshi}} in Japanese. These terms can be used as predicates, and do inflect for aspect.
: As such, when creating an entry for a Japanese adjective form, how should we proceed? Do we use the <code>===Adjective===</code> header, and then create some new {{temp|ja-adj form}} template for the second line, to avoid erroneous categorization? &#8209;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 18:44, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

== Different Spellings of Ladino ==

{{movedfrom|Category talk:Ladino headword-line templates#Different Spellings of Ladino}}

Hi, I'm working with Ladino Wikipedia and Wiktionary and I also want to contribute to the Ladino words in the English Wiktionary. A lot of words are misspelled eg. [[sefard√≠]] is not Ladino it's Castilian. In Judaeo-Spanish we say '''''sefarad√≠''''' (''sefaradi'' in Aki Yerushalayim and Turkish spelling and ''sefaradh√≠'' in the Multidialectal spelling).

Today, Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino) is spoken in 36 countries (although in 16 of them the speakers are less than 100). Historically, until the mid-19th century, it has always been written with the Rashi script, which is now not possible to use here, due to technical difficulties. However, with the rise of nationalism and also because of other reasons, most people started writing with the Latin alphabet. However, the conventions they use, more or less depend on the country they live in and on the type of schools they've been in (such as Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle)...Thus today there are around 20 different orthographical norms used for this language! (17 according to some and 22 according to some others)

Not all of these 20 are very common, for example those who use the Greek and Arabic scripts and those who use the German othographical conventions (including ·∫û; only very old Sephardim of Hamburg decent) and Dutch spelling (Jews of Cura√ßao) and Portuguese spelling (Jews of Brazil) etc. are not very wide-spread, however still in use. If we were to write each word with each kind of spelling, it would be way too much. However, just minimising it to 2; Latin and Hebrew would not be just for the very much used other spellings.

The most common/important 6 spelling systems are as follows (alphabetically ordered - and the possible letter to use in the template):
#Aki Yerushalayim (''a'' - Autoridad Nasyonala del Ladino)
#French (''f'' - Vidas Largas)
#Hebrew (''h'')
#Multidialectal (''m'' - Orto«µraf√≠a Unida)
#Rashi (''r'')
#Turkish (''t'')

The next 6 important spelling systems are as follows (not necessarily to be used here, again alphabetically):
#Cyrillic (''c'')
#Italian (''i'')
#Jaquet√≠a (''j'')
#Nehama (''n'')
#Old Spanish (''os'')
#Spanish (''s'' - Arias Montano)

These twelve spelling systems are the ones that we can most possible use to find citations. However I suggest, we use the most common 6, and as we can't use Rashi for now, let's just use the 5 (a, f, h, m, t) instead of the 2 (l, h). However giving four alternative spellings in the same row, doesn't seem logical to me, thus I suggest we give them under the title ''Alternative forms''.

If you guys, can help me change the template accordingly, that would be very nice. [[User:Wikitiki89|WikiTiki]], may be you could help me out, or direct me towards the right people who knows to do this?

One more thing, this parameter should be optional, because not every word is spelled in a myriad forms:
*''papel'' (m=a=f=t) and ''◊§◊ê◊§◊ô◊ú'' (h) ‚Üí We could mark ''papel'' (m) and ''◊§◊ê◊§◊ô◊ú'' (h)
*''par√¢'' (m), ''para'' (a=f=t) and ''◊§◊ê◊®◊î'' (h) ‚Üí We could mark ''par√¢'' (m), ''para'' (a) and ''◊§◊ê◊®◊î'' (h)
*''justo'' (m), ''djusto'' (a=f), ''custo'' (t) and ''◊í÷ø◊ï◊°◊ò◊ï'' (h) ‚Üí We could mark ''justo'' (m), ''djusto'' (a), ''custo'' (t) and ◊í÷ø◊ï◊°◊ò◊ï (h)
*''muchacho'' (m=a), ''mutchatcho'' (f), ''mu√ßa√ßo'' (t) and ''◊û◊ï◊í÷ø◊ê◊í÷ø◊ï'' (h) etc.

Thank you in advance,

: I agree with everything you said except what you said about Rashi script. We consider Rashi script and Hebrew script to be the same script. Rashi script is just a different ''font''. It will never have separate Unicode code points. Therefore, I see no reason why we can't have entries in the Hebrew/Rashi script. If a Rashi-script font ever becomes available with the proper licenses, we will be able to integrate it into Wiktionary. But until then there is nothing wrong with using the square-script fonts that we use for Hebrew and Yiddish. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:14, 27 February 2014 (UTC)

== French Verb Usage With Prepositions ==

Currently the meaning of French verbs is listed with a note about whether the meaning applies in the transitive, intransitive, impersonal, reflexive case etc. I have found that often this information is insufficient to be able to correctly use the verb in a sentence, particularly for the intransitive case. In French, intransitive verbs often change meanings depending on which preposition is used, ''√†'' or ''de'', or only one preposition can be used for that particular verb. Whether a verb takes ''√†'' or ''de'' is often arbitrary and can not always be worked out from context. Regardless of whether the meaning changes, whether a verb takes ''√†'' or ''de'' drastically changes that verb's usage in sentences where objects are replaced with pronouns. 

Some examples:
:parler √† - to talk to someone
:parler de - to talk about something
:arriver √† - to go to somewhere
:arriver de - to come from somewhere
:penser √† - to imagine
:penser de - to have an opinion about
:jouer √† - to play a game or sport
:jouer de - to play an instrument
:√™tre - to be
:√™tre √† - to belong to
:rire - to laugh
:rire de - to laugh at

I propose that entries for French verbs should contain more information about the prepositions that go with them. This information would be extremely helpful as it provides clarity about when the verb takes on particular meanings and is vital for understanding how to use the verb in a sentence. Other online dictionaries such as [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/parler Oxford Dictionary] and [http://www.wordreference.com/fren/parler Word Reference] do contain this type of information. Some verbs (very few) already contain this type of information but they seem to be the exception rather than the rule, e.g. [[faire]].

The current ''parler'' entry looks like this:
# {{lb|fr|intransitive}} To [[speak]] or [[talk]].
#: ''Il ne s'est mis √† '''parler''' qu'√† l'√¢ge de quatre ans.''
#: ''Ils '''parl√®rent''' plusieurs heures avant d'aller se coucher.''
# {{lb|fr|transitive}} to be able to communicate in a language; to [[speak]]
#: ''Elle '''parle''' couramment fran√ßais.'' - She speaks French fluently

I imagine it would need to change to something like this:
# {{lb|fr|intransitive}} To [[speak]] or [[talk]].
#: ''Il ne s'est mis √† '''parler''' qu'√† l'√¢ge de quatre ans.''
#: ''Ils '''parl√®rent''' plusieurs heures avant d'aller se coucher.''
# {{lb|fr|intransitive|~ '''√†'''}} To [[speak]] or [[talk]] to someone.
# {{lb|fr|intransitive|~ '''de'''}} To [[speak]] or [[talk]] about something.
# {{lb|fr|transitive}} to be able to communicate in a language; to [[speak]]
#: ''Elle '''parle''' couramment fran√ßais.'' - She speaks French fluently

:::: Many languages have things like this. In English, you have "talk ''about''" and "talk ''to''", Dutch has "praten ''over''" and "praten ''tegen''". The preposition to be used is often unpredictable and should be idiomatic by our standards. In many older Indo-European languages, cases fulfilled this role as well, like in Gothic {{m|got|êå±êåπêå≥êåæêå∞êåΩ||to ask}}, which took an accusative object for the person being asked, and a genitive object for the thing desired. Modern Finnish still uses cases like this, thanks to its elaborate declension system. So if we come up with a consistent way of indicating this, we should also include case usage. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 21:15, 27 February 2014 (UTC)

[[User:Vahagn Petrosyan|Vahagn]]? hell, [[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] even? Damn, we have lots of Slavicists.) It does not suit English well either ‚Äî¬†does "I talked to him about the situation" use "talk about" or "talk to"? Also, preposition stranding is something we probably should do away with.
:: I would suggest creating a new template to be placed at the end of definition lines. Say, {{temp|+obj|pl||acc|object being borrowed}} {{temp|+obj|pl|od|gen|person being borrowed from}} would render as something like ''[+ [accusative]: object being borrowed] [+ {{m|pl|od}} [genitive]: person being borrowed from]''. Or maybe a few templates even, each for a different grammar: {{temp|+cobj}} (inflection only, e.g. Finnish), {{temp|+prepobj}} (preposition only, e.g. French), {{temp|+prepcobj}} (preposition and inflection, e.g. Slavic languages), {{temp|+postpobj}} (postposition only, e.g. Japanese). [[User:Kephir|KeœÜr]] 17:14, 28 February 2014 (UTC)
::: I was just about to suggest something very similar. Only I don't see why we need separate templates, when optional parameters can handle all that. This will also be useful in defining prepositions that have different meanings when used with different cases. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:18, 28 February 2014 (UTC)
:::: I do like this idea because it's flexible enough to handle a wide variety of situations. It also prevents us from having to stuff it all into the context label, where it doesn't really belong. Concerning prepositions, we probably shouldn't code things in too hardly. Finnish has many postpositions, and languages may have circumpositions as well. Word order might also be different for different languages, so that in an SOV language the verb comes last in the phrase. For example Dutch has: ''over[prep] (object) heen[adv-prep] komen[verb]'' "to recover (emotionally) from", which contains the circumposition {{m|nl|overheen}} and the verb in final position. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:47, 28 February 2014 (UTC)

In ''parler de'' and ''parler √†'', the sense of ''parler'' is exactly the same. Therefore, there should be a single definition, but a usage note can be added about prepositions to be used in different cases. There should be different definitions only when the meaning is actually different. When, for a single meaning, several different words are used in English according to the case, I suggest that a ''Translations'' section would be appropriate (this is unusual here, but may be very useful). It would be the same case as ''[[stale]]'', which, for a single sense, is translated differently in French for stale water, stale butter, stale news, etc. [[User:Lmaltier|Lmaltier]] ([[User talk:Lmaltier|talk]]) 19:05, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
:: I've not studied linguistics, so I'm unfamiliar with the technical definitions of things, however, how much does a meaning have to change before its 'sense' is considered to have changed? Is this even relevant for a definition? To me, 'talking to someone' and 'talking about something' are different. Granted that they are about talking, one indicates the recipient of the action while the other relates to the content of the action. In a similar example, arriver a (to go to) / arriver de (to come from), the actions are similar but their directions are reversed. For penser a (to imagine) / penser de (to have an opinion about), the meanings are completely different. Perhaps technically their 'senses' haven't changed, but this is exactly the kind of information a user is looking for. Is the purpose of a dictionary to be linguistically purist or practically useful? As a student of French, I use a dictionary to find out the meanings of words and how to use them. The preposition a meaning requires is fundamental to the use of that language. Wiktionary currently displays this information very rarely and in a non-standardized way. I don't think it appropriate to hide such fundamental information away in the Translation table. The translation table should be about translating from one language to another, not locating fundamental information about a word in its own language.--[[User:Spuzzdawg|Spuzzdawg]] ([[User talk:Spuzzdawg|talk]]) 01:25, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::: Keep in mind that ''to imagine'' may also be stated in in some dialects of English as ''to think up''. "I thought of a solution we can try." And ''to think about'' is a way of stating an opinion - e.g. "I think that in these phrases the sense of penser is unchanged, while the use gives context." - [[User:Amgine|Amgine]]/<sup> [[User talk:Amgine|t]]&middot;[[Special:EmailUser/Amgine|e]]</sup> 16:51, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::::: Perhaps the senses of parler √†/de are not that dissimilar. There are other more clear cut cases where the sense completely changes with the use of prepositions: 
::::::manquer √† - to miss someone
::::::manquer de - to neglect (to do s.t.)
::::::venir √† - to happen to
::::::venir de - to have just (done s.t.)
::::: Regardless of how much the sense changes, the dictionary user still needs to know the information or they can't use the language. --[[User:Spuzzdawg|Spuzzdawg]] ([[User talk:Spuzzdawg|talk]]) 07:45, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

== Words that are both borrowings and compounds ==

In Oto-Manguean languages (among others), many nouns have a generic prefix indicating what type of thing they are. These prefixes are also added to loanwords, which poses a problem for Wiktionary templates because [[Template:prefix]], [[Template:compound]] etc. only allow morphemes from within one language.

E.g. for {{m|poe|ntames√°}}, I can't use [[Template:compound]] to give its etymology as {{compound|nocat=1|poe|inta|alt2=mes√°}}, because {{m|poe||mes√°}} doesn't exist as an independent word. But if I just use [[Template:bor]], it doesn't show the relationship to {{m|poe|inta}} at all.

Is there a way to produce something like "{{m|poe|inta}} + {{noncog|es|mesa}}", so that it categorizes it as both a compound and a borrowing? --[[User:Lvovmauro|Lvovmauro]] ([[User talk:Lvovmauro|talk]]) 12:13, 1 August 2019 (UTC)

== Linkages to limited entries ==
Being more of a user than contributor, I plead guilty of inadequate mastery of the Wiktionary facilities. Often I don't even know where to look. (I have only recently discovered how to enter an example, for example.) Now one thing that has frustrated me considerably: Suppose I wish to link to a headword that has many valid definitions, and all of them occur under one headword with separate definitions, but the link I want is a specific one in the list of definitions let us say "[[lustre]]", a noun, for which we have four entries, but suppose I want to refer to precisely the third. (Or the first entry under the verb FTM). Is there a facility for that? If so, I would be grateful for a link.

:There is no easy way, but I think the template {{tl|anchor}} can be used for this purpose. If you replace the third sense for the noun "[[lustre]]‚Äù by <code><nowiki># {{anchor|glass ornament}} a glass ornament such as </nowiki></code>..., then <code><nowiki>[[lustre#glass ornament|lustre]]</nowiki></code> will look as before but link directly to the glass-ornament sense.

==Gerund at bay==
There has been an exchange at and about [[gerund]]. The discussion had been too involved to permit me to go into detail here, but I have posted an example to illustrate what bothers me. First of all, there is a lot of argument about whether the concept still is viable in English (See [[Wikipedia:gerund|here for more detail]]), but I am not taking sides in that connection, though I am increasingly uneasy about extending the verbal noun concept to cover what is seen as for example verbal adverbial functions. It does however apparently exclude participles, in particular present continuous participles, which seems to me to amount to ''straining'' at straws that have been passed by camels. ("I smell a rat, I see it in the...") To add aggravation to lesion, the English article [[gerund]] currently has a Russian example that has only an uncomfortable equivalent in English, that isn't a verbal noun, and I am not comfortable with the idea of seeing it as a gerund at all. To illustrate the concept, I have added a natural Afrikaans construction that seems to me nearly exactly equivalent, given that my mastery of Russian stops short about at da, nyet, and tovarich.   Now, I don't know where this is heading, but could some members please have a look at [[gerund]] and the examples, and offer comments or pronouncements? [[User:JonRichfield|JonRichfield]] ([[User talk:JonRichfield|talk]]) 10:13, 2 August 2019 (UTC)

:Roughly speaking, a gerund is a verb form that some linguists choose to call a ‚Äúgerund‚Äù. I do not think any other short description will cover the meaning across the spectrum of languages. And it is hard to find two modern linguists who agree on which forms to call a gerund. The concept is a remnant of the outmoded conception that Latin is the perfect language with the perfect grammar, and that more barbaric languages such as English should be described in the terms developed for Latin grammar. &nbsp;--[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]] 18:33, 7 August 2019 (UTC)
:At a glance, it's easy to get the impression that the English translations, ''One shouldn‚Äôt cross a street '''while reading''' a newspaper'' and ''That fellow is crossing the street '''while reading'''!'', are supposed to be examples of gerunds in English, which they are not. [[User:Mihia|Mihia]] ([[User talk:Mihia|talk]]) 13:28, 8 August 2019 (UTC)
::We are lapsing a bit into prescriptivism here. If published works use the word gerund "carelessly", we should include the "careless" definition as well as at least one generally-accepted-accepted-as-correct-by-grammarians definition.
::Can an English deverbal term ending in ''ing'' take a plural while also being a pure gerund? To me the ing-forms that I can think of that have a plural form seem to be full-fledged nouns, eg, [[tracing]]s, [[rubbing]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[parsing]]s. Gerunds seem to behave generally like uncountable nouns. If so these might be useful to exemplify in the entry or mention in usage notes. I haven't subjected these notions to testing or to the authority of ''[[CGEL]]'' (2002), but perhaps we have an expert reading this.

:: But here it is only about the formatting. Indeed the IP does not explain (because its English is bad), but I don‚Äôt see a point in IvanScrooge98‚Äôs formatting either. The numbered pronunciation sections are not uncontroversial. We wanted to get rid of them for long, and recently one even argued to get rid of numbered etymology sections (won‚Äôt search out all the discussions now). In any case, the IP has correctly seen that IPA pronunciations are a bad ground to format all the page around it. Like I have recently said that the categorization of terms in a language as derived from a proto-language X is little a reason to duplicate etymologies everywhere, putting things everywhere that otherwise you would not put there but let stay at other places, so pronunciations whether in IPA or in audio do not justify to split apart all the main content by ‚Äúpronunciation‚Äù sections ‚Äì or by ‚ÄúEtymology‚Äù sections only because of different pronunciations, as has not seldom been done even if the given etymology is the same (‚Äúfrom the root Y‚Äù), often aggravating the obnoxiousness of the formatting by adding the same reference templates under every one of them üòµ. The pronunciation sections are not of equal importance for every language: In English and Chinese one needs them, in most other languages and in Arabic the opposite is the case, and in Arabic a problem becomes frequent because different pronunciations can have the same spelling so we could to put a pronunciation to every POS section even though this is not necessary to know the pronunciation from the dictionary alone (but the vocalization or transcription is) and here the reader would ask ‚Äúwhy would you do that?‚Äù ‚Äì the Saudi IP has appreciated that after seeming me cleaning up the thus messed-up formatting of many Arabic pages.
::What I opt for is to get rid of the pronunciation sections in Arabic entries altogether an adding a switch to inflection tables the readers can toggle to switch the transcriptions in the tables to IPA, or similar, and add parameters to include audio files in inflection table entries; it fits the language much more too, since else we only give a pronunciations for the lemma form which is one form of a hundred in verbs, and one of at least 15 in common nouns, else it looks quite arbitrary as opposed to English or Chinese where one does not have all these forms. Heavily inflecting or agglutinating languages which are written ([[ggf.]] with diacritics or transcriptions, but then even more so) unambiguously suggest to put pronunciations at a less showy place, while pronunciation sections are more for languages where the lemma pronunciation covers most and to give pronunciations is also required because the spelling leaves doubts about the pronunciation. [[WT:EL]] has not been written with all that in mind, sure, but is rather based on English-like requirements. So far it is already beneficial to realize the different information requirements in the treatments of various languages, not to make the entry layout a tool against legibility.

== Tamil ==

I am new to Wiktionary, so I don't know where to post but I'm wondering about the use of colloquial Tamil on Wiktionary. Just as Egyptian Arabic and other colloquial Arabic dialects used frequently in speech but not in writing (while both Modern Standard Arabic and written Tamil are used in writing but not speech) have entries, would it be possible that I, a native Tamil speaker, could add in colloquial Tamil entries? This may be as simple as including the IPA under the written Tamil entry as a separate dialect similar to how both Received Pronunciation and American English pronunciations are given for English entries or I could also create separate entries and link the written and spoken Tamil forms in the same way that Persian, Dari, and Tajik entries are on Wiktionary. (For examples of the differences between the two registers, even the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are pronounced quite differently in the two: o·πâ·πüu vs. o·πá·πáu, ira·πá·π≠u vs re·πá·π≠u, m≈´·πâ·πüu vs m≈´·πáu, nƒÅ·πâku vs nƒÅlu, and aintu vs a√±cu.) Also, I've noticed a couple inaccuracies with IPA pronunciations on Tamil entries stemming from what I assume is an inaccuracy in the code for the Template:ta-IPA. Is there a way for me to edit this template? (By inaccuracies, I mean mostly the use of [d ë] where [s] should be and [ss] where [t ÉÀê] should be.

Romans had no spaces, so what? Include every sentence or every text as an entry? The policy-changes will continue to be Anglo-centric, one is unable to articulate or conceptualize what should be included because of unavailable language knowledge. Better not to add any policies, it usually removes people one step further from common sense. That being said, there was no reason to add [[WT:COALMINE]]¬†and there is no reason to remove either as long as one does not see reasons to remove words of the {{m|en|coalmine}} type. I think this aporia is analogous to the {{w|A language is a dialect with an army and navy|distinction between language and dialect}}. Like one cannot wholly shed languages and dialects, in lexicography under unlimited ressources one cannot pin down the language of every string that can be quoted, and one does not see where compositions are so unnecessary that they should be deleted.

::Why care? Because it licenses the creation of multi-word SoP entries. Why does this matter? Because it is counter to the standard principles of any dictionary and also potentially confusing to users who happen upon the phenomenon. Users should, and presumably largely do, understand that to find the meaning of "X Y" they have to combine the meaning of X with the meaning of Y in cases where "X Y" does not have any special meaning in combination. A separate entry for "X Y" gives the impression that there is a special meaning not understandable from X + Y. Then there is the issue, as Equinox mentioned, of small numbers of obscure/nonstandard citations having an impact beyond what they merit. How much sense does it make to have an entry for "cluster size", for example, purely on the basis that a few people who couldn't tell a variable name from proper English wrote it as "clustersize"?

Given that reconstructed entries require descendants, derived terms or other evidence that the reconstruction can be based on, I'm not sure if this is at all possible.

== Words with multiple inflection patterns: one inflection table or several? ==

When a word can follow multiple patterns of inflection, the alternative forms are often shown next to each other within a single inflection table. But there are also entries where multiple inflection tables are shown. I'm wondering which of these approaches works better in practice. Showing multiple forms together in one table takes up less space, but it is no longer easy for the reader to separate out the different inflection patterns.

There are extreme cases like Slovene {{m|sl|strgati}}, which can inflect according to no less than four different patterns: two different present tenses, and two different accentuation patterns. Many of the forms are shared between the four, in particular the infinitive, so they could theoretically all be stuffed into one table, but it becomes very hard to make out. Two tables are also possible, but which aspect of the inflection should be combined, the present tense formation or the accent pattern? A case where all forms are in one table can be seen at {{m|sl|kopati||to bathe}}, where there are no less than four distinct imperative forms. Then there are cases like {{m|sl|gaziti}} where the majority of the inflection has one form and accent pattern (AP ''a'' in this case), but the l-participle can follow multiple accent patterns (both ''a'' and ''b''). Having multiple inflection tables in this case seems like overkill. Where to draw the line, though? When is it clearer to put everything in one table, and when is it better to split them? ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 19:37, 10 August 2019 (UTC)

:I think this should be handled on a case-by-case basis. If the different patterns are truly different paradigms, it is probably better to use multiple tables. But if we have a few variations within one paradigm, showing the alternatives side by side probably works better. Here is a sketch of an algorithm for computing a score for basing the decision on; I have no idea how it will work out in practice.
:#Combine all forms in one table
:#For every cell that contains N alternatives, where N ‚â• 2, add N to the score
:#For every cell that contains just one form, subtract 1 from the score
:#If the score is positive, use multiple tables; otherwise, use a single table.

In ''"the glass '''broke'''"'', we just have an intransitive, where there is no semantic patient / grammatical object, and just a semantic agent / grammatical subject.  "Breaking" doesn't need to be a transitive action, semantically speaking.  With intrinsically transitive actions, however, such as {{m|en|eat}} or {{m|en|cook}}, using the semantic patient / grammatical object as the grammatical subject and leaving the semantic agent unstated gives us something that can be usefully described as "ergative": ''"moose meat '''eats''' well"'', ''"these eggs '''cook''' up nicely"'', etc.
::: Regarding the verb {{m|en|waver}}, however, I agree with [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] and [[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]] -- the verb, as I understand it, is consistently intransitive, so using it transitively doesn't make any sense, and thus there cannot be a passive.

Meanwhile, there are "intransitive" verbs described as {{m|ja|Ëá™ÂãïË©û|tr=jid≈çshi|lit=self-moving word}} where the action is purely a matter of the agent doing something on their own, without directly altering or affecting any patient, but these verbs can still take objects marked with {{ja-r|„Çí}} in certain constructions, and that also doesn't change the class of the verb.  For both {{m|ja|[[ÁßÅ]][[„ÅØ]][[Ê≠©„Åè]]||I walk}} and {{m|ja|[[ÁßÅ]][[„ÅØ]][[Â±±ÈÅì]][[„Çí]][[Ê≠©„Åè]]||I walk the mountain road}}, the verb ''aruku'' ("walk") is a ''jid≈çshi'' regardless of the presence or absence of the object.
:: When talking about "ergativity" as it applies to English verbs, in order to use the label in a meaningful and useful way, we have to look at the semantics of the verb: is the action something done by an agent to a patient, or something that the agent does on its own without affecting any patient?  For verbs like {{m|en|break}} or {{m|en|melt}} or {{m|en|turn}}, these ''could'' be semantically transitive where an agent does something to a patient, but they could ''also'' be semantically intransitive, where the agent just does the action of the verb without requiring a patient.  Describing these verbs as "ergative" is not very useful, and I think it's more likely to confuse users who instead learned these verbs as ambitransitive: either transitive or intransitive depending on context.  For other verbs like {{m|en|eat}} or {{m|en|read}} or {{m|en|say}}, these can only be semantically transitive, as the actions inherently describe an agent doing something to a patient, even though they might be syntactically intransitive if a given context leaves the object unstated.  Using the object of such a semantically transitive verb as the subject is a strange construction in English, almost a kind of passive.  Semantically intransitive verbs have no sensible passive, while semantically transitive ones do.  Similarly, semantically intransitive verbs have no sensible ergative.  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 19:22, 13 August 2019 (UTC)
:::I'd be in favor of banning ''[[ergative]], [[ambitransitive]]'', and ''[[ditransitive]]'' from use in definition-line labels (generally, but at least in English) on the grounds that the terms are not readily understood by normal users. My evidence is that if one compares usage patterns of "transitive verb"/"intransitive verb" with those of "ambitransitive verb", "ditransitive verb", and "ergative verb" the latter three occur almost exclusively in scholarly books and articles, whereas one can find the former in basic texts and even in newspapers and magazines.

* Yes, as [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] notes, English descriptive materials about the English language generally don't discuss semantic transitivity, unless it's a highly technical text.  English-language dictionaries of the English language, to my knowledge, never touch on semantic transitivity, only focusing on syntax.
: In your examples, ''"He smiled at me"'' is intransitive, albeit with an indirect object, whereas ''"He smiled a big smile"'' is transitive, and without an indirect object.  Moreover, the presence or absence of an indirect object has no effect on the transitivity of the verb: only the presence or absence of a direct object.  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 16:31, 16 August 2019 (UTC)

I propose some kind of mention (maybe a "see also") be (automatically?) added in the section of verbs with forms homographic with other parts of speech, as the verbal entries are the ones looked up first.

== I wouldn't mind a little {{smallcaps|something}} ==

Assume a reader who is unfamilar with the expressions looking at the entries {{m|en|something or other}} and {{m|en|some something or other}}. It is completely invisible that in the first one the word ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is a fixed and immutable part of the expression, while in the second one it is a placeholder, to be replaced by some something or other. The ambiguity has bothered me for some time. Can we do something about it? Yes we can, by giving such placeholders a distinctive appearance. After considering several possibilities, I think that using smallcaps is probably the best. The head of {{m|en|some something or other}} would then become:
:{{en-noun|-|head=[[some]] {{smallcaps|something}} [[or]] [[other]]}}
We could let the placeholder link to some page like [[Wiktionary:Placeholders]] which could explain (among several things) that our use of ‚Äú{{smallcaps|something}}‚Äù may include animate beings, and that ‚Äú{{smallcaps|one}}‚Äù and ‚Äú{{smallcaps|one's}}‚Äù refer to the subject of a verbal phrase (as in {{m|en|lose one's cool|lose {{smallcaps|one's}} cool}} (not followed consistently at present; e.g., the opinion holder of {{m|en|in one's opinion}} need not be the subject)). (There are some technical issues; for example, {{tl|mention}} does not like {{tl|smallcaps}} in the first parameter, but I am confident that our grease pitters can work such things out.)

''The Free Dictionary'' uses parentheses for this purpose, at least in entries from ''Farlex Dictionary of Idioms'', as seen in their entry [https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/throw+something+in+someone's+face ‚Äúthrow (something) in (one's) face‚Äù]. We also do this occasionally, as in {{head|en|verb|head=[[give]] (something) a [[go]]}}. A reason not to follow this is that we also occasionally use parentheses for indicating an optional part of a lemma (e.g. ‚Äú{{head|en|phrase|head=([[the]]) [[word]] [[is]]}}‚Äù). So does, in fact, ''The Free Dictionary'' in entries from ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs''. I think it is not a good idea to cast out one source of ambiguity by introducing another one.

Traditional textual use of square brackets is mainly confined to editorial stuff: editorial comments (such as ‚Äú[''sic'']‚Äù or [https://books.google.com/books?id=vaPEKoR4O5gC&pg=PA568&dq=%22%5Bpen-corrected+to+Thraldome%5D%22&hl=en&sa=X ‚Äú<nowiki>[pen-corrected to Thraldome]</nowiki>‚Äù]), editorial omissions (‚Äú[...]‚Äù), editorial alterations (mostly change of case, as in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ztiIbdfXOc8C&pg=PA105&dq=%22%5bT%5dhe+next+day%22&hl=en&sa=X ‚Äú<nowiki>[T]he next day</nowiki>‚Äù]) and editorial insertions (seen mostly in transcriptions and translations: [https://books.google.com/books?id=mXCeAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&dq=%22ass%5bistant%5d%22&hl=en&sa=X ‚Äú<nowiki>ass[istant]</nowiki>‚Äù], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaaUDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA4-PA23&dq=%22holy+%5bplace%5d%22&hl=en&sa=X ‚Äú<nowiki>holy [place]</nowiki>‚Äù]). This is unlikely to interfere with the intended use here.
# Most readers are probably not aware of any convention for marking placeholdership, so, whichever way we choose, readers will have to get accustomed to something new. But I expect this to be largely self-explanatory, just as the current practice is already largely self-explanatory. With this proposal, there will be an additional visual clue that a term like ‚Äú[something]‚Äù is not to be taken literally, ‚Äúas is‚Äù, which will be mainly useful for readers not familiar with the idiom. We may define a template {{tl|placeholder}}, abbreviated {{tl|ph}}, taking a language code and one of the placeholders for that language. Any decisions to link to a placeholder glossary or show hover-over content can then be delegated to a single place ‚Äì the code for the template ‚Äì and be revisited as desired. Editors should be encouraged to choose usage examples that illustrate the variability; in almost all cases that will obviate a need for specific usage notes.
# I am not aware of current uses of square brackets that may conflict with this plan. They occur, of course, in the IPA of pronunciation sections, but that should not present an issue. Round parentheses are used in the headword lines for grammatical info such as gender and inflectional suffix, but always  in italics contrasting with the roman font of the terms. Round parentheses are also used for many purposes outside of headword lines, but as far as I know either for optionality (also in IPA) or for what may be considered parenthetical clarifications, such as accents in the pronunciation sections, labels and glosses in the definitions, and senses in synonym sections, again with a body in italics offsetting them from the roman of the terms.<br />For other scripts, other square brackets may be needed than the conventional ASCII ones. For example, {{w|Chinese punctuation}} uses the full-width square brackets U+FF3B and U+FF3D, so we would have ‚Äú[[‰Ωø#Mandarin|‰Ωø]]ÔºªÊüê‰∫∫ÔºΩ[[ÁÅ´ÂÜí‰∏â‰∏à#Mandarin|ÁÅ´ÂÜí‰∏â‰∏à]]‚Äù rather than ‚Äú[[‰Ωø#Mandarin|‰Ωø]][Êüê‰∫∫][[ÁÅ´ÂÜí‰∏â‰∏à#Mandarin|ÁÅ´ÂÜí‰∏â‰∏à]]‚Äù as the Mandarin translation of {{m|en|make someone's blood boil|3=make <span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[someone's]</span> blood boil}}. (That translation is a sum-of-parts, so it should not have its own entry, but it is still useful to identify the placeholder in that sum-of-parts).
# I do not foresee the need for rules to prevent overuse/abuse and am generally not in favour of inventing rules before the need becomes apparent. What can be done is to have a data module with the standard placeholders (per language), so that a warning can be issued when an editor uses a non-standard one (e.g. ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù), similar to the data module for acceptable ancestors in etymology. But this may be overkill.

The best option, in my opinion, would be to include the square brackets in the page title, but the Mediawiki software does not allow that. The official reason is that they are needed for link syntax, although I do not see how that would be a problem, provided we do not use double brackets or URIs in page titles. I feel the code checking for illegal titles ought to be a bit smarter than it is. <nowiki>{{DISPLAYTITLE}}</nowiki> also does not allow one to add brackets. So, unfortunately, we won't see
:<span style="font-family:HelveticaNeueLT Std Med,Myriad Pro,Noto Sans,Roboto,Calibri,Corbel,Segoe UI,Verdana,DejaVu Sans;font-size:150%;">give [someone] a piece of [one's] mind</span>
(A distasteful but effective hack might be to use the Chinese full-width brackets instead, also for Latin-script titles.)

Here is a tentative definition for a template {{tl|placeholder}}, abbreviated {{tl|ph}}, taking a language code and one of the placeholders, meant for language languages using an alphabet:
:<code><nowiki><span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[#2]</span></nowiki></code>
For the headline, code like
:<code><nowiki>{{head|en|verb|head=[[give]] {{ph|en|someone}} [[a]] [[piece]] [[of]] {{ph|en|one's}} [[mind]]}}</nowiki></code>
will then come out as
:{{head|en|verb|head=[[give]] <span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[someone]</span> [[a]] [[piece]] [[of]] <span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[one's]</span> [[mind]]}}
When using templates such as {{tl|mention}}, code like
:<code><nowiki>{{m|en|give someone a piece of one's mind|give {{ph|en|someone}} a piece of {{ph|en|one's}} mind}}</nowiki></code>
should come out as
:{{m|en|give someone a piece of one's mind|3=give <span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[someone]</span> a piece of <span style="font-style:normal;padding-left:0.1em;color=#000;">[one's]</span> mind}}.

In the [[Wiktionary:Grease pit/2019/August#sco-smi (Middle Scots)|Grease Pit]] there's a discussion about promoting Middle Scots to a full language so that it can have its own entries separate from Scots. A Middle Scot entry has been created ([[threschald]]), but it's using the language code and templates for Scots at the moment. There might be other entries (search query: <code>: insource:"Middle Scots"</code>) that could be migrated to this language code.

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling.

We have an idea of what tools ''could'' be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project [[m:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|on Meta]] and [[m:Talk:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|post comments and feedback]].

== Norwegian Bokm√•l: classification and etymology issues ==

I originally started the discussion at [[Module_talk:languages/data2#Edit_request%3A_ancestors_of_Norwegian_Bokm√•l]], but was asked to post here instead.

<small>(Background info: The Bokm√•l standard of written Norwegian came to be by branching off the common Danish language used in Norway and Denmark after the written Middle Norwegian language died off. During the 19th century a Norwegian pronunciation of this language was developed (much like how standard German is ‚ÄúHigh German with Low German pronunciation‚Äù). A spelling reform in 1907 brought the Danish language written in Norway closer to this Norwegian pronunciation (e.g. -ede > -et) and also adopted some features of the native dialects of the capital area. After that, the language was definitely considered different from the Danish written in Denmark. In the mid-19th century the Nynorsk standard was created based on a ‚Äúreconstructed base dialect‚Äù of all the native Norwegian dialects. The standard was slightly adjusted in 1901 and 1910 to reflect actual use. At this point the standards were clearly different languages. Then, in 1917, 1938 and 1959, radical spelling reforms aimed to merge the two. That project is now generally considered a failure and some of the changes have been reduced. Despite this, none of the standards have been reversed to their pre-1917 counterparts and Bokm√•l has adopted considerable amounts of Norwegian vocabulary, syntax, inflections and syntax. Because of this, Bokm√•l is no longer considered a dialect of Danish (saying that it still is, is considered offensive by many of its users)¬†‚Äì and this is where the problems start.)</small>

Wiktionary‚Äôs [[Module:languages]] is programmed to consider Bokm√•l a descendant of Middle Norwegian. While it can be argued that Middle Norwegian is one of its ancestors (given the large amount of Norwegian elements it has adopted, and also the fact that there exists multiple text written in Norwegian with the common Danish orthography, as well as the fact that Norwegian authors have incorporated elements from their own native Norwegian dialects through the whole period of Danish orthography in Norway), it still contains a lot of words inherited from Danish too (with or without changed spelling). One example is ''hellig'', which has remained unchanged from the common Danish spelling. It was incorrectly listed as a descendant of Old Norse ''heilagr'' (I suppose that the source of this mistake is ''Bokm√•lsordboka''), so I wanted to correct that, i.e. write that it was inherited from Danish ''hellig'', which in turn is inherited from Old Danish ''h√¶l√¶gh''. However, since Bokm√•l is not registered as a descendant of Danish, <code><nowiki>{{inh|nb|da|hellig}}</nowiki></code> produces an error message. Using <code><nowiki>{{bor}}</nowiki></code> (borrowed) instead is simply wrong; the word was not borrowed ‚Äì it has been there all along. The current solution seems to be the <code><nowiki>{{der}}</nowiki></code> template, even though its documentation clearly states that <code><nowiki>{{inh}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{bor}}</nowiki></code> are preferred for words that are confirmed to be inherited/borrowed.

Because Bokm√•l has roots in both Danish and New/Middle Norwegian, I would like to request that the system reflect that, i.e. that Danish is added as an ancestor of Bokm√•l. While it is controversial to say that Bokm√•l is not a Norwegian language today, it is a historical fact that it has ''roots'' in Danish and the spoken Dano-Norwegian koin√© (see [[:w:Dano-Norwegian]] and also the language family tree in the infobox at [[:w:Bokm√•l]]). Listing both Middle Norwegian and Danish as ancestors will allow correct etymologies to be entered and, as far as I can see, will cause no new problems. [[User:H√•tt|H√•tt]] ([[User talk:H√•tt|talk]]) 01:21, 22 August 2019 (UTC)
: I don't see why it's wrong to list it as borrowed. It wasn't there all along; it didn't exist in Norwegian until the Danes came along. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 13:49, 22 August 2019 (UTC)

:: It is correct that it was borrowed into the spoken language, but not in the written Bokm√•l standard. Unlike Nynorsk, Bokm√•l was not created from scratch, but instead developed from the common written Danish. The transition from Danish to early Bokm√•l happened gradually and the last newspaper to adopt the 1907 spelling reform (Aftenposten, a major one) did not fully do so until 1923. Borrowing indicates that a foreign element enters the language. The form ''hellig'' was used during the entire transition period (and is still used today), so I do not see how it can be listed as borrowed (if it was, when did the borrowing happen?). The word ''bil'', on the other hand, was coined by the Danes in the early 1900s and quickly borrowed into Swedish and Norwegian (both Bokm√•l and Nynorsk).

:: {{reply|Erutuon}} [[User:H√•tt]] as a Norwegian should know more than I do; generally I would say that modern Bokm√•l was influenced by Danish as Denmark occupied Norway for many years, it was also part of Sweden before it finally gained independence (which is celebrated every year on 17 May). On the other hand Danish accepted Norwegian words such as [https://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=ski ski] (in DDO, no Danish entry yet), so there has been a two-way traffic. As H√•tt says Danish lingered on in Norway until the 20th century, until it was Norwegianised. Many Bokm√•l words have different spellings to Danish, but others have the same spelling. Both languages took words from Old Norse and Middle Low German, the latter may have come via Danish. Even now there is an unofficial language called [[Riksm√•l]] which comes from Danish, it was officially replaced by Bokm√•l a long time ago. I would say that {{tl|inh}} and {{tl|bor}} were added by some non-Norwegian editors, I only used {{tl|der}} when doing etymology cleanups. ''[[User:Donnanz|DonnanZ]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 20:26, 10 October 2019 (UTC)''

::: I should add that while Norwegian got a lot (most?) of its Middle Low German words through Danish, Middle Low German (and Dutch) also had direct influence on Norwegian. Notable examples include the usage of the possessive reflexive pronoun as a genitive particle (see [[:w:His genitive]]) and words such as ''veldig'' (‚Äúvery‚Äù, Danish retained native ''meget'') and ''gutt'' (‚Äúboy‚Äù, Danish mostly uses native ''dreng''). Riksm√•l is simply a continuation of the pre-1938 Bokm√•l (a spelling reform that year sought to bring Bokm√•l and Nynorsk much closer together by force, which attracted a great deal of resistance from both sides), since the 1950s(?) standardised by a non-governmental organization called The Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature (the name Riksm√•l comes from the predominant name of Bokm√•l from 1899 to 1929). As mentioned, the attempt to merge Bokm√•l and Nynorsk is generally considered to have failed, and since the 1980s, Bokm√•l and Riksm√•l have gotten closer and closer: the government abandoned the goal of merging Bokm√•l and Nynorsk, and following the resigning of [[:w:Aftenposten]]‚Äôs editor in 1990 and a renewal of the Riksm√•l movement in the 1990s, most of the former ‚Äúsignal words‚Äù of Riksm√•l have fallen out of use. The current situation is that the Riksm√•l standard is de facto a subset of Bokm√•l, with a few insignificant exceptions.

::: I agree that there has been some two-way traffic, but words of Norwegian origin were often adapted to fit into the written Danish standard. An example is the Norwegian word ''[[:w:Rubus_chamaemorus|molte]]'' (or ''molta''), which was brought into the common written language as ''multe'', and ''foss'' (‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù) became ''fos''. The core of the common language (pronouns, inflections, syntax, spelling ‚Äúlaws‚Äù etc.) used in Denmark-Norway was always Danish and even though it was heavily Norwegianised in Norway roughly a century after the dissolution of the union, that process happened gradually, which is why I think that Bokm√•l should have Danish as an ancestor. The core of Nynorsk, on the other hand, remains Norwegian even though that standard has been heavily influenced by Danish through the attempt to merge it with Bokm√•l.

::: [[User:H√•tt|H√•tt]] ([[User talk:H√•tt|talk]]) 00:47, 11 October 2019 (UTC)
: This reminds me a lot of English: if you only looked at the relative numbers of words in the lexicon for each source, you might think Middle English was a dialect of Old French. The core vocabulary, though, is predominately inherited from Old English. The question is whether a similar pattern holds for Norwegian. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 04:36, 11 October 2019 (UTC)

::: I have often thought that Bokm√•l is a compromise between Danish/Riksm√•l and Nynorsk, even Nynorsk has alternative spellings which are the same as Bokm√•l for some words, but inflections can differ between the two. English words have also been taken into Bokm√•l independently of Danish, also many words are of French, Latin or Greek origin without an intermediate language being given as a source. ''[[User:Donnanz|DonnanZ]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 10:20, 11 October 2019 (UTC)''

:::: It is more a compromise between 19th century Danish and Nynorsk. Even before it was Norwegianised through spelling reforms to form Bokm√•l, Danish as written in Norway diverged from Danish as written in Denmark. As mentioned above Norwegians used words from their native dialects and as mentioned below the Danes adopted the Swedish practice of not writing ''j'' between ''g''/''k'' and certain vowels. However, the language was still considered to be the same until the comprehensive Norwegianisation started in the early 20th century. The first book to be translated from Bokm√•l into Danish was published after 1900 if I recall correctly. [[User:H√•tt|H√•tt]] ([[User talk:H√•tt|talk]]) 02:11, 18 October 2019 (UTC) 

:: In my opinion, a similar pattern does not hold for Norwegian. Of course it is much harder to define a clear boundary between originally Norwegian and originally Danish vocabulary, since the languages are so closely related (and the eastern dialects have several Eastern Scandinavian features), but in some cases it is possible. Certain words that clearly are of Danish origin have been replaced by Norwegian ones, but a great number of Danish words remain. Of the personal pronouns, only the 2nd person plural pronoun has been replaced by native forms (''dere'', ''dere'', ''deres'' for Danish ''I'', ''eder''/''jer'', ''eders''). Excluding the forms that are identical in Nynorsk and Danish, Bokm√•l retains these Danish forms (original Nynorsk forms in parentheses): ''jeg'' (‚ÄúI‚Äù, Nynorsk ''eg''), ''hun'' (‚Äúshe‚Äù, Nynorsk ''ho'', dialectal ''hu''), ''hennes'' (‚Äúher(s)‚Äù, Nynorsk ''hennar''), ''ham'' (‚Äúhim‚Äù, Nynorsk ''honom'', now ''han'', dialectal ''hanom''), ''de'' (‚Äúthey‚Äù, Nynorsk ''dei''), ''vi'' (‚Äúwe‚Äù, Nynorsk ''me''), ''dem'' (‚Äúthem‚Äù, Nynorsk ''deim'', now ''dei'') and ''deres'' (‚Äútheirs‚Äù, Nynorsk ''deira'', dialectal ''d√∏ms'' < ''d√∏m'' = ''dem''). It should be noted that eastern lowland dialects have had ''je'' (= ''jeg'') and ''vi'' for centuries due to their close relationship with the neighbouring Swedish dialects (Old Swedish: ''iak'' and ''vƒ´(r)''). In addition, -s from ''hans'' was generalised as a genitive marker many Norwegian dialects too, independently yielding forms such as ''hennes'' and ''deires''/''d√∏ms'' (Danish ''deres'', Swedish ''deras'') etc.

:: Other core vocabulary in Bokm√•l of clearly Danish origin, foreign to the spoken dialects (except through recent borrowings):
::* Prepositions: ''frem'' (‚Äúforward‚Äù, Norwegian ''fram''), ''ad'' (''fremad'', ''oppad''; ‚Äúto‚Äù, Norw. ''√•t''), ''fra'' (‚Äúfrom‚Äù, Norw. ''fr√•'')
::* Adverbs: ''hvordan'' (‚Äúhow‚Äù, Norw. ''kor(leis)'', ''√•ssen'', ''√•'' etc.), ''fremdeles'' (‚Äústill‚Äù, Norw. ''framleis''), ''s√•ledes'' (‚Äúthus‚Äù, Norw. ''soleis''/''s√•leis''), ''kun'' (< older Danish ''ikkun'', ''ikke uden''; ‚Äúonly‚Äù, Norw. ''bare''/''berre''), ''meget'' (‚Äúvery‚Äù, Norw. ''(my(kj)e)''¬†‚Äì rarely used in this sense), ''ikke'' (‚Äúnot‚Äù, Norw. ''ikkje'', ''inkje'', ''itte''), ''s√¶rdeles'' (‚Äúlargely‚Äù), ''innen''/''uten''/''siden'' etc. (Norw. ''-a(n)'')
::* Nouns: ''hjem'' (Norw. ''heim'', ''him''), ''lege'' (‚Äúdoctor‚Äù, Norw. ''l√¶kjar'', ''leker''), ''uke'' (‚Äúweek‚Äù, Norw. ''vika'', ''veke'' etc.), ''melk'' (‚Äúmilk‚Äù, Norw. ''mj√∏lk''), ''mel'' (‚Äúflour‚Äù, Norw. ''mj√∏l'')
::* Verbs: ''tro'' (‚Äúthink, believe‚Äù, Norw. ''tru''), ''lyve'' (‚Äúlie‚Äù, Norw. ''lyga'', ''ljuge'' etc.), ''gjemme'' (‚Äúhide‚Äù, Norw. ''g√∏yma'', ''gj√∏mme'' etc.), ''glemme'' (‚Äúforget‚Äù, Norw. ''gl√∏yma'', ''gl√∏mme'' etc.), ''velge'' (‚Äúchoose‚Äù, Norw. ''velja''), ''selge'' (‚Äúsell‚Äù, Norw. ''sel(j)a'')
::* Adjectives: ''lav'' (‚Äúlow‚Äù, Norw. ''l√•g''), ''h√∏y'' (‚Äúhigh‚Äù, Norw. ''h√∏g'' < OSw. ''h√∏ÃÑgher'' ca. 1400, ''h√•(g)''), ''syk'' (‚Äúsick‚Äù, Norw. ''sjuk''), ''myk'' (‚Äúsoft‚Äù, Norw. ''mjuk''), ''sort'' (‚Äúblack‚Äù, Norw. ''svart'')
::* Numerals: ''syv'' (7, Norw. ''sj(a)u'')
:::* Removed by spelling reform in 1951, but still used by many: ''tyve'' (20, Norw. ''tju(g)e''), ''tredve'' (30, Norw. ''tretti'')
::* Other: ''selv'' (‚Äúself‚Äù, Norw. ''sj√∏l(v)'', ''sj√¶l'' etc.), ''(h)verken'' (‚Äúneiter‚Äù, Norw. ''korkje'' etc.), ''hva'' (‚Äúwhat‚Äù, Norw. ''k(v)a'', ''(h)√•'', ''k√•'' etc.), ''hvor'' (‚Äúwhere‚Äù, Norw. ''kvar'', ''kor'', ''√•'' etc.), ''hvilken'' (‚Äúwhich‚Äù, Norw. ''√•kken'', ''kven'', ''k(v)a for ein'' etc.; ''som''), ''-s'' (enclitic genitive marker, originally died out in Norw.)

:: Long story short, Bokm√•l is 19th century written Danish, somewhat modified to serve as a written standard for the spoken Dano-Norwegian koin√© of the upper class (‚Äúdannet dagligtale‚Äù). Given the close relationship between Danish and Norwegian (as I believe the examples above in most cases show), especially south-eastern dialects, this was thought to be enough for it to serve as a national standard. After all, until 1907 pure Danish already did<sup>1</sup>. Knud Knudsen, known in Norway as ‚ÄúBokm√•lets far‚Äù (‚Äúthe father of Bokm√•l‚Äù), believed in gradual change and predicted that in the future (he died in 1895) the native Norwegian dialects would influence and further Norwegianise both spoken and written Dano-Norwegian.

:: Thus, in my opinion, Bokm√•l‚Äôs roots in Danish are too important to be ignored when linguistically classifying it. As far as I know its history is unique and I do not see any significant problems with it having two ancestors in the template/module. That allows words of Danish origin that have been consistently used since the language was identical to Danish to be entered as inherited from older forms of Danish, while also allowing words of native Norwegian origin to be entered as inherited from earlier forms of Norwegian (in 19th century Bokm√•l it would be correct to consider a Norwegian word foreign to Danes to be borrowed, but nowadays that makes no sense).

:: <small><sup>1</sup> With exceptions. At the Scandinavian language conference in Stockholm in 1869 it was decided to follow the Swedish practice of not writing ''j'' between ''g''/''k'' and vowels ''√∏''/''√∂'', ''e'' and ''√¶''/''√§'' (e.g. ''g√∏re'' < ''gj√∏re''), but in the end only the Danes did. Some Norwegian authors adopted the new spellings ([[:w:Henrik_Ibsen|Henrik Ibsen]]: ''Gengangere'', not ''Gjengangere''), but the practice never caught on. Even users of the emerging Landsm√•l (Nynorsk) decided to stick to the old Danish practice.</small>

== Intransitive verbs with a specified preposition ==

Using the verb ''file'' as an example, the fourth meaning reads 
 (intransitive, '''''with'' for''', chiefly law) To submit a formal request to some office. 
However, the verb ''search'' shows 
 (intransitive, '''followed by "for"''') To look thoroughly 
I think a formal label should be added to the ''Appendix:Glossary'' explaining the currently wording '''''with'' for''',  '''followed by "for"''' , etc.  --[[User:Backinstadiums|Backinstadiums]] ([[User talk:Backinstadiums|talk]]) 18:09, 22 August 2019 (UTC)
: I think it's an abuse of the label anyway. Context labels are meant to show meanings that occur in a specific context. But in this case it's not a meaning of the word in question, but rather the meaning of the word ''combined with'' another word. It's not that {{m|en||file}} means "to submit a formal request" whenever it's used with {{m|en||for}} but rather the combination {{m|en||file for}} that has this meaning. Secondly, we have the {{temp|+preo}} template which is intended for this purpose. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 18:17, 22 August 2019 (UTC)

== Numerous etymologies in table of contents (ToC) ==

For some entries with multiple etymologies (e.g. [[a-]]), the table of contents is only useful with one level - the languages. That's because it contains a list of mostly duplicate "Etymology 1"..."Etymology N" hierarchies with no ways of distinguishing them. An alternative, would be to replace N with a distinguishing summary, e.g.,
* Etymology 1 - Middle English a- (‚Äúup, out, away‚Äù)
* Etymology 2 - Old English an (‚Äúon‚Äù)
* Etymology 3-  Middle English a- ("with")
Or even briefer - just the senses. After all, we don't want the ToC to get too wide!

However, I'm not a linguist and unsure about solutions. Perhaps simply reducing the TOC limit is suitable in some cases. The general problem remains, I have found that the ToC is often less than usefull.

(If the Etymologies headers are augmented, an {{temp|anchor}} with their old name may be required to prevent breaking links.)

== Japanese: move kana and r≈çmaji to the pronunciation section ==

In a Japanese entry, the kana and r≈çmaji forms are currently placed in the headword templates. However, a look into [[Module:headword]] reveals that these places are originally for ''inflections'' instead of alternative scripts:
: <strong class="Jpan headword" lang="ja">‰Ωø„ÅÜ</strong> (<i>transitive</i>, <i>godan conjugation</i>, <i>ren'y≈çkei</i> <b class="Jpan" lang="jp">[[‰Ωø„ÅÑ]]</b>, <i>past</i> <b class="Jpan" lang="jp">[[‰Ωø„Å£„Åü]]</b>)
Transliterations are supported but handled separately (and apparently Latin-only):
: <strong class="Jpan headword" lang="ja">‰Ωø„ÅÜ</strong> [[Wiktionary:Japanese transliteration|‚Ä¢]] (<span lang="ja-Latn" class="headword-tr tr Latn" dir="ltr">tsukau</span>) (<i>transitive</i>, <i>godan conjugation</i>, <i>ren'y≈çkei</i> <b class="Jpan" lang="jp">[[‰Ωø„ÅÑ]]</b>&lrm; <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span lang="ja-Latn" class="tr Latn">tsukai</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i>past</i> <b class="Jpan" lang="jp">[[‰Ωø„Å£„Åü]]</b>&lrm; <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span lang="ja-Latn" class="tr Latn">tsukatta</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>)

In light of this, I would like to propose ''moving the kana and r≈çmaji to the pronunciation section'', for the following reasons:
* The standard entry layout requires the pronunciation section ''before'' the headword lines. This means that for kanji entries like {{m|ja|Áî≥„Åô}}, the reading first appears in phonetic transcriptions (<span lang="ja" class="Jpan"><span style="border-top:1px solid black;position:relative;padding:1px;">„ÇÇ<span style="position:absolute;top:0;bottom:67%;right:0%;border-right:1px solid black;">&#8203;</span></span>„Éº„Åô</span><span class="Latn"><samp>[m√≥Íúú√≤s√π]</samp></span> and <span class="IPA">[moÃûÀês…®·µù]</span>) and then in kana and r≈çmaji which more people regard as the "reading" ({{l|ja|„ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Åô}} and {{l|ja|sc=Latn|m≈çsu}}). This reverses the usual logic of kanji entries, because kanji spellings must first be "read" to get words and words then have phonological information. If we move the reading to the pronunciation section and display it prominently, then the structure of kanji entries can become more clear:
<blockquote>
{{fake====|Pronunciation}}
{| style="margin: 0 1em .5em 0em"

</blockquote>
* For words having multiple parts of speech, the alternative scripts must be repeated in every headword template, which makes maintenance harder and error-prone. If we change the format of headword templates to the first one above, we can eliminate all repetition. If we change it to the second one above, we can still eliminate repetition of the historical kana and ky≈´jitai.
* Ky≈´jitai can be moved to {{temp|ja-kanjitab}} and displayed in a larger font size. Historical kana will receive better support (support of "historical hiragana and katakana" for entries like {{m|ja|ËÄ∂ËòáÊïô}}, multiple historical hiragana for entries like {{m|ja|Âêë„Åì„ÅÜ}}, etc.)
* Headword lines can be more learner-friendly (as shown above).
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages with such an approach:
* It means a lot of work to do (possibly by bots). For example, entries lacking a pronunciation section should be supplied one, and entries with {{temp|ja-pron}} which lack orthographical information (Áèæ‰ª£‰ªÆÂêçÈÅ£„ÅÑ quirks, capitalizations, spaces and hyphens, etc.) should be fixed. Such a change would also make the pronunciation section mandatory for new entries.
* If we go for the first format of headword templates above, then kana and r≈çmaji would be completely decoupled from POS or sense. This means that entries like {{m|ja|„ÅäÁéâÊùìÂ≠ê}} would require something like {{para|orth<var>n</var>_note}} (similar to {{para|acc<var>n</var>_note}}) to indicate which spellings apply to which senses. It would also make auto generation of categories like [[:Category:Japanese type 1 verbs that end in -iru or -eru]] impossible.

What do you think of such an approach?

: I haven't had time to fully think through the ramifications, but broadly speaking, I'm in support of this proposal.  Some notes:
:* ''"...then kana and r≈çmaji would be completely decoupled from POS or sense."''  This should already be the case.  If a specific sense has a different reading, then that sense should be split out to a separate etymology section.  As such, all entries under a given etym should have identical kana and romaji.  If a specific sense has usage quirks, such as using katakana in certain contexts, those should be explained in a usage section.  Alternatively, we could follow the practice of various other monolingual Japanese dictionaries, and indicate specific spellings at the start of the line.
:* ''"...entries lacking a pronunciation section should be supplied one..."''  Under current practice, we (the JA editor community) already strive so that every entry, and indeed every etym section for every Japanese entry, should have its own pronunciation section, so there is no opposition from me on that score.
:* ''"It would also make auto generation of categories like [[:Category:Japanese type 1 verbs that end in -iru or -eru]] impossible."''  I don't follow.  We would have to continue adding kana to headword templates anyway for proper generation and sorting of the basic POS categories.

::: {{reply|Eirikr}} Thanks for your reply, but I think we have reached a consensus to eliminate sortkeys, haven't we? A look at [[:Category:Japanese nouns]] reveals that the current sorting scheme works poorly, but even if it works well, the mass acceleration of kana forms of kanji entries will flood the category like this: {{m|ja|„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çç}}, {{m|ja|ËóçËâ≤}}, {{m|ja|„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çì}}, {{m|ja|ÊÑõÈ£≤}}, {{m|ja|„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Å°}}, {{m|ja|Áõ∏ÊíÉ„Å°}}, {{m|ja|„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Åà„Åç}}, {{m|ja|ÊÑõÊ∂≤}}, etc. If we sort entries by their usual order, i.e. kana by kana and kanji by kanji, then there will be no harm to the kana part of the entry, and you get a new way to look up entries‚Äîby kanji.
::: {{reply|KevinUp}} For example, {{m|ja|ÂøÖÁÑ∂}} has two parts of speech, so the reading <code>„Å≤„Å§„Åú„Çì</code> is repeated in the two headword templates.

Some like specialized senses last. Some like literal/physical senses first. Some like grouping by grammatical properties, eg, (in)transitive, (un)countable. Unfortunately, there are many entries where these preferences conflict.

I asked user Rua, who did a lot of the coding, and he suggested I ask here. 

Could we change the display of e.g. an infix ''ka'' from -ka- to ‚ü®ka‚ü©? That's the standard format (e.g. Leipzig glossing rules). Otherwise it looks like a suffix followed by another suffix. And could we make param 1 optional, as it is with template:suffix? It's useful to be able to say 'may contain an infix ‚ü®ka‚ü©' and link to the category without providing the stem, especially if the stem is obscure. 

Thanks.

:We are not in the business of interlineal glossing, so I don‚Äôt see how the Leipzig glossing rules would apply.

== Need a uniform policy on handling of Latin specific epithets ==

{{wgping|la|u1=Fay Freak|u2=Brutal Russian|u3=JohnC5|u4=Lambiam}} [[User:Marontyan]] has been manually editing various Latin adjectives and nouns that are used as specific epithets and converting them into Translingual entries. I'm not opposed in principle to this, but
# We need a specific, uniform policy for handling these before editing them piecemeal.
# We need to agree on a format that preserves as much info as possible. Currently I include a full declensional table, which may be overkill but does clearly show the masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular forms. For these terms I've created a template {{temp|la-epithet}} meant to go into the Usage Notes section that indicates as far as I can tell whether the term is exclusively, mostly, or additionally used as a specific epithet, and what grammatical type it is (adjective, noun in the lemma form, noun in the genitive singular, or noun in the genitive plural). It also adds the term to [[:Category:Specific epithets]].
The tricky thing here is that a lot of specific epithets also are used at least occasionally in other Latin. This goes especially for {{m|la|-ƒìnsis}} terms (e.g. diplomas from Princeton are or were in Latin and used {{m|la|Princetoniƒìnsis}}, and the seal of the University of Arizona says "SIGILLUM UNIVERSITATIS ARIZONENSIS" on it), but may apply to other terms as well, so we need to be careful before we conclude that a given Latin term is exclusively used as a specific epithet and hence should maybe be converted to Translingual. For this reason my instinct is to leave these as Latin terms (they -- mostly at least -- follow Latin grammatical rules, after all), but others may disagree. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 06:46, 26 August 2019 (UTC)

::That‚Äôs why we shouldn‚Äôt imagine a strict distinction between Latin and Translingual. This distinction is merely a product of the minds of Wiktionary editors. The language users just use the words and do not think first which language their words are in but whether they understood, or whether they conform to any rules; or the Latin words they use can be ‚Äúthought‚Äù only and code-switched to without ever having been used in Latin text. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the inflection tables ‚Äì or if we are at it also the head templates ‚Äì should just have a parameter that makes the tables Translingual, so not linking the forms as Latin but as Translingual or not at all (for it is then still effective for SEO if the forms are there but not linked). Then it is [[six and two threes]] whether an epithet we create is Latin or Translingual because the content will be the same. This is probably also easy to implement for {{ping|Benwing2}}.

:: Taxonomic Latin originated as actual Latin, and (for plants, algae and fungi at least), is occasionally still used as such for the formal description of a taxon. Mostly, though, you have nouns in the nominative and genitive as well as adjectives in the nominative and sometimes in the genitive (for parasitic species named after the host). When names aren't used in Latin sentences, accusative, dative, locative and vocative are completely absent. Generic names are nouns in the nominative singular. Names of higher taxa are generally formed by replacing the ending of the genitive of a generic name with a standard ending denoting the rank. Epithets for species and below are mostly adjectives agreeing in gender with the generic name, but also nouns in the nominative singular or plural, and nouns in the genitive singular or plural agreeing in gender and number with the referant. So taxonomic names use a subset of Latin morphology, but that subset follows Latin rules. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 13:59, 26 August 2019 (UTC)
:::After edit conflict. Some duplication of Chuck's contribution.
:::I can live with almost any resolution of this, including no resolution. I use {{temp|epinew}} to allow links from inflection lines to the lemma form of specific epithets in whatever language I choose for the main entry for the epithet. Usually the epithet has an existing Latin or Translingual entry. But I sometimes declare a term that is identical in spelling to a word in, say, Old Tupi to be Old Tupi instead of creating a vacuous Latin or Translingual L2 section for the term.
:::Specific epithets that are adjectives need only nominative singular inflected forms. Some specific epithets are nouns and can either be nominative singular or genitive, sometimes singular, as in eponyms, sometimes plural, as in nouns referring to a habitat or host of an organism. Full declension tables are not necessary to provide information for the proper use of specific epithets.
:::That said, as noted above, some terms used as specific epithets have had other use. That use includes use by the Roman Catholic church in some internal communications; use in running Latin text for scientific purposes, including use outside of Linnaean taxonomy; and use in various mottos, inscriptions, and formal documents. It is usually time-consuming (and often impossible) to try to attest to such use in contexts other than taxonomic names, just as it is time-consuming (and often impossible) to attest to some rarer inflected forms of classical Latin words, especially verbs.

:[[WT:CFI]], [[Talk:albifrons]] for example, and [[WT:Translingual]] are quite clear about this:
:# If not used in Latin, it isn't Latin (see [[WT:CFI]], [[Talk:albifrons]]).
:# Even if attested translingually, there can still be a Latin entry (see [[WT:Translingual#Other languages]]).<br /> This should also go vice versa: If there is a Latin entry, there can also be an entry for a translingually used term. (Somewhat) similar to how there is [[football]] in many languages.
:Additionally:
:* [[Template:la-epithet]] is (often) wrong in Latin entries: "and thus not inflected except in ..." isn't correct for Latin. It applies to English, French etc. which isn't Latin. And even if a term isn't attested in Latin, the note can be wrong as shown in {{m+|mul|ruderalis}} and by the plural of {{m+|mul|Homo sapiens}}.
:* [[riobamba]] is wrong: It's translingually used {{m|mul|riobambae}} - in Latin it would be *Riobamba as it is a proper noun. It's more obvious when comparing for example {{m+|mul|fleischmanni}} and {{m+|la|Fleischmanni}}, form of {{m|la|Fleischmannus}}.<br /> (Of course, the translingually used form could also occur in Latin, but than it's science-speak, rather something similar to a chemical formula like {{m|mul|H‚ÇÇO}}, and not usual Latin.)
:* "separating alternative conjectures with slashes": Well, bad or too dubious conjectures shouldn't be listed at all. And even the inflection of {{m+|la|amethystizon}} looks dubious in many ways: Most forms lack a star, and gen. sg. could also be *amethystizontos, acc. sg. m.&f. *amethystizonta, nom. & gen. & voc. pl. n. *amethystizonta, compare the Greekish acc. pl. amethystizontas instead of a Latinate *amethystizontes. And even if amethystizon would have Latin forms, why shouldn't it still be amethystizonta instead of amethystizontia similar to {{m|la|vetus}} with vetera? Anyhow, the entry lacks Greekish conjectures and might be better with no conjectures.
:* "taxon names have to be grammatically correct Latin": Which doesn't mean it is grammatically correct Latin or Latin at all. {{m+|de|Handy}}, {{m+|fr|foot}} and other [[pseudo-anglicism]]s aren't English either, even if native German or French speaker might reject that such terms are classified as German, French etc.
:* "So why classify them as ‚Äútranslingual‚Äù?":
:** Many taxonomic terms are used in multiple languages, that is, they are used translingually.
:** "Translingual" covers international science-speak and codes (see [[Wiktionary:Translingual#Accepted]]).
:** Many taxonomic terms aren't used in Latin, and thus aren't Latin, just like pseudo-anglicisms aren't English.
:* "What about the epithets that change under gender agreement; are these Latin while the gender-invariant ones are not?": Gender and gender-agreement in case of taxonomic terms also occur translingually, even in English.<br /> What might be more interesting: Does the taxonomically implied gender always agree with the language's gender, is it for example always "{{l|de|der}} Homo sapiens" {{g|m}} or does also an incorrect "die Homo sapiens" {{g|f}} or "das Homo sapiens" {{g|n}} occur? In case of {{m+|mul|Nix Olympica}} the gender of {{m+|la|nix}} and of the translingually used term do not always match. Would be funny, if {{m+|mul|Homo sapiens}} is male by origin and taxonomism, but female or neuter in some language, e.g. if foreign terms (usually) become neuter in that language.

== Transliteration for Mandarin, Japanese, Korean - No italics or italics depending on situation? ==

I've been using {{temp|zh-l}}, {{temp|ja-r}}, {{temp|ko-l}} much too often, which led me to think that romanizations in Chinese/Japanese/Korean are always written in italics.

My recent [[Wiktionary:Grease_pit/2019/August#Improvement_for_Module:nyms|request]] at the Grease Pit made me realize that italics are for mentions, whereas romanizations in lists are usually unitalicized, as [[Special:Diff/53998315/53998394|explained]] by [[User:Rua]].

However, Chinese, Japanese and Korean entries using {{temp|zh-l}}, {{temp|ja-r}}, {{temp|ko-l}} have romanizations in italics by default, regardless of whether it appears as a mention or in a list.

Should we apply the usual convention in Wiktionary, i.e. italics for mentions, and no italics for lists? I think making them all appear as italics by default (for Mandarin, Japanese, Korean romanizations) would be more manageable.

I've noticed that most languages use {{temp|l}} or {{temp|der3}} for derived terms, which gives transliterations without italics. However Japanese entries use {{temp|ja-r}} instead for derived terms, which gives transliterations in italics. This is because {{temp|ja-r}} can also be used in running texts.
The same situation also occurs in Chinese and Korean entries, where transliterations of derived terms appear in italics even though they are lists, not mentions. [[User:KevinUp|KevinUp]] ([[User talk:KevinUp|talk]]) 12:14, 28 August 2019 (UTC)

== Relax SOP a bit ==

Contrary to rescinding [[WT:COALMINE]] (which has been proposed, and for which the proposal has drawn overwhelming opposition), we should move more in the direction of relaxing SOP a bit, and including more common collocations that don't fit neatly into current SOP exceptions. Obviously we shouldn't have an entry like [[yellow floppy disk]] to define "a [[floppy disk]] that is [[yellow]]", but if a phrase occurs for which some reasonable argument can be made that, for example, it relies on unintuitive senses of the words involved, or has component words using one of a number of possible senses. Basically, we should spend less time discussing these at RfD. I'm sure someone is going to suggest that this would impose an increased burden of maintaining those entries, but with over six million entries, the cost of maintaining any additional harmless entry is less than 1/6,000,000th the cost of maintaining the dictionary as a whole.

== Categories: what kinds of entries should they go in? ==

I've been chewing on this question in the back of my mind for a while.

Japanese entries almost always have multiple forms, due to the complexities of the writing system.  As one example, take {{m|ja|ÈáçÁÆ±Ë™≠„Åø|tr=j≈´bakoyomi||a specific kind of reading of a Japanese kanji compound}}.  The lemma form is [[ÈáçÁÆ±Ë™≠„Åø]], the historical (pre-spelling-reform) kanji form is [[ÈáçÁÆ±ËÆÄ„Åø]] the hiragana form is [[„Åò„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Å∞„Åì„Çà„Åø]], the historical hiragana form is [[„Å¢„ÇÜ„ÅÜ„Å∞„Åì„Çà„Åø]], the romaji form is [[j≈´bakoyomi]] (or possibly [[j≈´bako-yomi]], depending on convention), the katakana form is [[„Ç∏„É•„Ç¶„Éê„Ç≥„É®„Éü]], and the historical katakana form is [[„ÉÇ„É¶„Ç¶„Éê„Ç≥„É®„Éü]].

The thing itself is labeled as {{temp|lb|ja|linguistics}}.  But which of the entries for these various forms should be included in [[:Category:ja:Linguistics]]?

* Only the lemma form?
: In general, all entry details should be consolidated into the entry for the lemma form, and entries for alternative (non-lemma) forms should be bare-bones soft redirects, as I've understood things so far.
* All forms?
: In the interests of usability and discoverability, the argument can be made that ''all'' forms should be categorized, to aid users who might look up a given form in a category index, without knowing which form is the lemma.
* Some other selection of forms?
: I can't think of a use case myself, but others might have ideas about including only some forms in categories, but not all of the forms.

Any insights appreciated.  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 22:23, 28 August 2019 (UTC)

: I would like all of the forms (minus the [[r≈çmaji]] forms) to be included for discoverability and also because the determination of what is the lemma form (main entry) and alternative form in Japanese can be rather subjective especially when it comes to rare or technical terms.

:: {{reply|Eirikr}} If we include in [[:Category:ja:Linguistics]] only the lemma forms, then it makes sense to sort the entries by reading. If we include all forms, then it makes sense to eliminate sortkeys and sort kana by kana and kanji by kanji. I was (and still am) in favor of the latter approach so I made {{temp|ja-see}} copy all categories.

== Should definitions be formatted like sentences? ==

Hello! Do you like worms? And do you like convenience foods that can be kept on the shelf for years until you need them, without the hassle of refrigeration? Then you'll love CAN OF WORMS. Let's open it.

Should definitions be formatted like sentences? This doesn't mean they must grammatically ''be'' sentences ("A fruit that grows on apple trees" is not a sentence) but it means they would start with a capital letter and end with a full stop/period. I have been pondering this because I keep seeing people taking an edit as an excuse to impose their favourite style. For example, for ''months'', myself and my evil twin [[User:SemperBlotto]] have been removing and adding the full stop (I add, he removes): it's become a sort of joke to me now, although the subject has never been aired between us: I've seen hundreds of edits of this kind. Likewise, [[User:Embryomystic]] seems to take any opportunity to change "A fruit." to "a fruit", and has sometimes revised basic words to change dozens of sense lines to that style.

Thoughts:
# '''Does it matter at all?''' Well yeah, I think consistency matters, in the same way that a newspaper has a "house style", or a software development company. Partly it gives us more of a brand and more consistency, rather than looking like some vague shit that was slapped together by randoms (ahem), and partly agreeing on this stuff means that we can stop wasting our time on it and work on the actual important things.
# '''What about definitions longer than one sentence?''' These are rare and can often be rephrased, but they do occur: something like a techy maths entry that says "A member of a subgroup X such that Y=Z.  X may be either A or B."  Writing these without caps would be a very weird violation of English style, regardless of our own conventions. So ''if'' we are going to support multi-sentence definitions, then ''for consistency'' we should probably make all definitions sentence-like.
# '''What about non-English stuff and translations?''' This is a biggie, since usually our English definitions are complex phrases ("the purple fringe of a king's cloak") whereas foreign defs are often one-words translations like just "apple". There is some argument to separate them though since, if you look at (say) fr.wikt, that does the same thing for its own language: words in the default lang (French) get long detailed definitions while others mainly just get quick translations. Basically these do not serve the same purpose: the primary language is trying to explain X in language X, in detail, whereas the secondary language is trying to give you the right word for conversation, phrasebook-style.

Who wants a vote on this? Actually that's premature. Opinions and thoughts would be welcomed.

[[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 10:40, 30 August 2019 (UTC)

*I think it is a matter of style. The OED does capitals and full stops, but it also puts hyphens in where they are not needed. Nobody's perfect. I don't go out of my way to change things but I remove full stops (if I remember) if I am adjusting the entry for any other reason. [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 10:50, 30 August 2019 (UTC)

*: It ''is'' a matter of style but I'm proposing that we should have a house style rather than keep reverting each other.

* As a (possible?) counterpoint to DCDuring's description of foreign-language definitions, ''sometimes'' a one-word gloss is all that's needed -- say, for a simple concrete term like {{cog|ja|Áä¨|tr=inu|t=dog}}.  However, for less-concrete terms, the concept of the term in one language may not have any direct analogue in English.  I ran into that just yesterday with {{cog|ja|Èâà|tr=nata}}, which is a general term for a kind of one-handed thick-bladed tool of any of a wide array of shapes and sizes.  This could be called by various things in English depending on the specific type of ''nata'', including such varied terms as {{m|en|[[hatchet]], [[billhook]], [[machete]], [[froe]]}}, and probably a few others that didn't occur to me.
: [[IFF]] we adopt the style of "full sentence format for all sense lines", we run into some issues:
:* Do we have to rewrite single-word glosses?  For {{cog|ja|Áä¨|tr=inu|t=dog}}, how do we make a sentence out of the "dog" sense without making a mess of it?
:* Do we keep single-word and other very-short glosses as non-sentences, and only use sentence format for long senses, as at {{cog|ja|Èâà|tr=nata}}?
:: That might make some sense, but then we have inconsistent formatting even within a single language's entries.
: [[IFF]] we ''don't'' adopt this style for non-English terms, and maintain the status quo, then we have inconsistent formatting between English and non-English entries.

These dots have been invented to separate sentences from each other. Since the glosses are kept separate by their formatting, the full stops are excess of information that diverts from the actual content. Think about the glosses about lists ‚Äì should list entries ends with dots? No. They are a childhood disease of Wiktionary, arisen in a time when people had less experience how content on the internet is presented, thus English entries have them, as begun earlier, while foreign languages do not. ‚Äì Another purpose of the dot is to signify that here the sentence ends, or depending on the language that this is no exclamation or question, this is why messages, like tweets, commonly end with it. But this dictionary glossing is not writing letters or texting. Just think: What do I want to signify with that mark? I don‚Äôt see anything: to signify¬†‚Äúdone‚Äù I ''save''. Any entry should regularly be in a state of doneness, no dot needed to show off.<br/>
And the starting with a capital letter actually causes information loss since there is sometimes a distinction by capitalization in English, and the message gets lost not only because of diversion but also because the capital form of a word not lexicalized as bearing a capital letter is less iconic. For the apprehension of the dictionary content to be as fast as possible we should not capitalize or add dots mechanically, and the same for the sake of new editors, whom we want to spare arcane distinctions. Those talks about whether something ‚Äúis a sentence‚Äù are intrinsically vain ‚Äì the presentation should be utilitarian.

:: It might be in print so, but on the computer one writes a thing, then goes back to middle and adds something, and also edits do not only contain glosses. The glosses are not like programming statements that end with a semicolon. And even in programming there are languages the statements of which end with line breaks merely. Also it does not show anything 1. when one is constantly confused because in foreign languages one does not add dots 2. because one only adds the dot because it is elsewhere so, so it does not signify anything. Don‚Äôt tell me what it shows when I put the dot: It shows decidedly nothing: I do not understand it to have any meaning, hence it has none. And it cannot have any meaning.

== Where is the documentation on Javascript in Wiktionary/MediaWiki? ==

For Lua there's [[WT:LUA]] aka [[WT:Scribunto]], which gives a nice introduction to Lua and has links to explain the MediaWiki-specific things. Is there an the equivalent for JavaScript? I don't have that much experience with this language and it's a bit confusing trying to make sense of e.g. the stuff going on in [[MediaWiki:Common.js]] or [[User:Ruakh/Tbot.js]]. I've found some documentation on www.mediawiki.org but it seems rather disjointed. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 02:52, 1 September 2014 (UTC)
: You won't find much in MediaWiki because those were written by people here at Wiktionary. I suppose there might be documentation somewhere of the Wikimedia infrastructure that the JavaScript code is manipulating, but it wouldn't explain what we're doing with it. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 03:47, 1 September 2014 (UTC)
:: Right, I get that those were written here but I assume the documentation should be common to both projects. Is there any JavaScript documentation here on Wiktionary? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 05:53, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
: Why even have [[WT:Scribunto]] here anyway? For the most part, it seems to duplicate content over at [[mw:Extension:Scribunto/Lua reference manual]]. <span class="signature">‚Äî [[User:Kephir|KeœÜr]]</span> 06:39, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
::Please don't delete it. It has lots of important introductory info not found in the MediaWiki Lua reference manual, and more importantly, it's '''here''' on Wiktionary. Someone who goes looking for info on Lua will likely try [[WT:Lua]], which is a link to [[WT:Scribunto]], and they will get a nice intro page on Lua, as expected. It's far less obvious to go look on the MediaWiki pages, even less obvious that you have to look under "Extension:Scribunto". Someone who's interested in Lua scripting will probably have heard something about scripting being in Lua but it's unlikely they'll have heard of Scribunto as such. Certainly, I found the docs in exactly this fashion. If there were a [[WT:Javascript]] page, it would be a '''huge''' help.

== [[:Template:character info]] adding bogus script cats ==
{{movedfrom|Wiktionary:Grease pit/2014/August}}
There are at least four redlinked "script" categories in [[Special:WantedPages]] that bear the names of Unicode blocks that aren't actually scripts:
#[[:Category:CJK Compatibility Forms script]]
#[[:Category:Enclosed CJK Letters and Months script]]
#[[:Category:Miscellaneous Symbols And Pictographs script]]
#[[:Category:Supplemental Punctuation script]]

With my limited template skills, I'm not sure if it's the parameters passed to {{temp|character info}}, or something about these Unicode blocks themselves that the template code can't handle, but {{temp|character info}} is where the cats are generated.

Can anyone figure out why this is happening, and make it stop? Thanks! [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 00:10, 1 September 2014 (UTC)
: {{ping|Kephir}} ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 23:59, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:: The problem is simple: the various {{temp|<var>Unicode block</var> character info}} templates pass the Unicode block to {{temp|character info}} in a {{para|script}} parameter, which is then used to form a category name. It may be suppressed by adding an empty {{para|category}} parameter to {{temp|character info}}, or removing the {{para|script}}. [[Thread:User talk:Yair rand/TabbedLanguages rewrite|And the category name is wrong anyway.]] (I am sure you could have figured that one easily.) The replacement I have been working on, {{temp|character info/new}} does not add any categories, but I am not sure if this is right (probably not). Additionally, the code for it ([[Module:character info]]) is relatively messy, and uses a rather crude hack for script detection (although using [[Module:scripts]] for that would make it even worse, if it be possible at all). So it is not really ready for deployment. <span class="signature">‚Äî [[User:Kephir|KeœÜr]]</span> 04:46, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
: {{ping|Kephir|Chuck Entz}} I have made some changes to these templates and I think it has solved the problems. The parameters of {{temp|character info}} are more straightforward now. {{paramref|block}} specifies the Unicode block name to display and the appendix to link to; {{paramref|sc cat}} specifies the script code of the character category to add it to. Because you specify a script code, it's ensured that the category will always be valid. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 23:55, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

== quote-newsgroup is not suitable for non-Usenet groups ==

I was looking at [[Twihard]] and noticed that it has several citations from Google Groups, which (even though Google ''also'' archives Usenet newsgroups) are not part of Usenet. However, because the citations are formatted with the ''quote-newsgroup'' template, it incorrectly says "Usenet" beside them. What is the best solution? [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 07:52, 2 September 2014 (UTC)

:In this case, the best solution is probably to remove them, because non-Usenet Google Groups are not durably archived, and the non-durable citations do not significantly differ from the durable citations in date or in how well they illustrate the use of the word. <br>But there will be other cases where non-durable citations are worth keeping ‚Äî words need three durable citations to meet CFI, but once they have three durable citations, there's no prohibition on them also citing non-durable things, e.g. as usexes (if they illustrate the typical usage of the term better than the durable citations), or as support for a statement that the word has been attested since year X (if they predate the durable citations). After all, the online editions of Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com are cited in many etymologies. I suppose the question is whether we need a new "non-Usenet-group" citation template for the non-durable citations we do keep, or whether {{temp|quote-web}} is enough.

== [[Template:head]] should take <tt>f1tr</tt> etc. params ==

{{wgping|ar|u1=CodeCat}} {{temp|ar-verb}} passes in a parameter <tt>f1tr</tt> that's intended to be a translation of an additional verb form (the imperfect), but {{temp|head}} doesn't support that. Presumably it should support it; in the meantime, what's the best way to make this visible? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 05:45, 3 September 2014 (UTC)

:No, it shouldn't. Most foreign script languages don't transliterate inflected forms in the headword, e.g. Russian (e.g. {{l|ru|–≤–µÃÅ—Ä–∞}}, {{l|ru|–¥–µÃÅ–ª–∞—Ç—å}}). One reason: it makes it cluttered, the other: if the transliteration is irregular, one should always supply it. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 05:50, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
::Whether the transliteration is irregular has nothing to do with whether it should be displayed. As for cluttering, I think that's questionable. There's only one inflected form here and it's not going to clutter things by adding the transliteration. The general practice anyway is to transliterate most words -- why do we bother providing transliterations in inflection tables if someone's just going to say it "clutters" the tables? The intention was clearly to provide such transliterations, that's why the imperfect transliteration is provided. Was there a general decision made at a certain point not to provide transliterations of inflected forms? [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:20, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
::: I think there was but I can't find it at the moment.

::::BTW {{temp|ar-noun}} does include transliteration of the inflected form (the plural). It does it by manually inserting the transliteration, although with your changes it looks like it now appears twice (one comes from the use of {{temp|l}}). An example is [[ÿ≤ÿ±ÿØ]]. We should probably remove the manual insertion. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 06:36, 3 September 2014 (UTC)

Likewise, the Arabic headword templates need only use {{temp|head}}, which they already do, however some more functionality needs to be added to {{temp|head}} such as what we are discussing here. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:43, 5 September 2014 (UTC)
::::: I find complicated template hacking to be nightmarish, much harder than using Lua. But then again, I am a programmer.

:::::: Yes, complicated templates are nightmarish, and that's why I support replacing all the complicated parts with Lua, but that doesn't mean that the whole thing needs to be Lua (look at the examples I linked to above, they are both very simple). --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 21:35, 5 September 2014 (UTC)
::::::: Indeed, these are parsable although IMO they're about at the limit of where it makes sense to switch the whole thing to Lua, just because template syntax is so horrible.
::::::: BTW in the case of these two templates, I would make it so it automatically infers the stem and ending from the headword. This needs to be done in Lua but it will make it much easier to add conjugations to new adjectives since you just cut and paste the same call to {{temp|be-decl-adj}} or whatever in every adjective lemma. I did this with Old French verb conjugation and with Arabic verb conjugation (in this latter case, inferring the radicals is significantly more complicated than inferring the stem/declension for Ukrainian or Belarusian).

== <s>[[Appendix:Arabic Frequency List from Quran]]</s> ==

The subpages have been showing up intermittently in [[:Category:Pages with module errors]] because {{temp|l}} now transliterates, so the {{temp|xlit}} makes 2 transliterations per line and the page tends to run out of script execution time. Could someone who knows what they're doing remove the autotranslit column? I ran into text-direction issues that scrambled things when I converted between formats.

It may actually be possible to consolidate further, since the Arabic text in all three Arabic columns seems to be identical ({{ping|Atitarev}} should be able to confirm). If it is, then it would be best to have the lemma column changed to use {{temp|l}} and the other two Arabic columns removed. Thanks!

There's nothing magical about 1000 lines per page, and it's much too big to really navigate through, anyway. We've been having several long and heavily-templated pages showing up with this error every few days, but those clear up with a null edit (I suspect running of processes by system people or heavy usage are temporarily slowing the system down).

::::::::: Hmm, that is a possibility. Some of the subs are shared between transliterating and checking for nil, and some aren't. For example, once the exceptional cases are handled, transliteration just maps all the remaining characters to Latin equivalents regardless of the exact sequence of consonants and vowels, but checking for nil needs to check to make sure the ordering is correct.

== Broken sort ==

When using {{temp|der3}} I found that Ancient Greek entries wouldn't sort correctly; for example entries starting with Œ≤ would come before ·ºÄŒ≥ would come before Œ¥.

After some digging ({{temp|der3}} calls [[Module:columns]] calls <code>table.sort</code>) I've found that Scribunto appears to somehow override the <code>&gt;</code> operator so that it'll interpret √°/√§/ƒÖ/etc. as "a" (instead of sorting them by Unicode value as usual); however letters with Ancient Greek diacritics (·ºÄ/·æ≥/·ºÅ/·æ∂) are treated as an empty string. I don't know how to fix this, or even where the relevant code might be. If anyone could solve this problem, or even point me in the right direction, that would be great.

Partly, in my personal view, the Echo/Notifications project was driven by low usability of watchlist; [http://xkcd.com/927/] comes to mind. It's also perhaps worth noting that Echo users aren't exposed to Special:Notifications unless thy have JavaScript disabled ‚Äî in which case it's their only means of reading the notifications.

== How do you indicate the argument frame of a verb? ==

The verb [[ÿ®ÿßÿ≠ÿ´]] in Arabic has the approximate meaning of [[discuss]], but it is a form III verb, and like other such verbs, it takes a person as a direct object (who you're discussing with), and the topic of discussion appears after the preposition {{m|ar|ŸÅŸêŸä}} "in". I have tried to indicate that as follows, but I don't really think this is right, and it looks ugly:

# to [[discuss]] with (someone) (a question {{lb|ar|with {{m|ar|ŸÅŸêŸä}}}})

In linguistic terms, what I'm trying to describe is the argument frame of the verb. In my dictionary, it appears as follows:

:to discuss (Ÿá with s.o.) (ŸÅŸêŸä a question)

where the Ÿá (a letter "h") is a standard Arabic dictionary abbreviation for a direct object that's a person. However, I'm not sure if this formatting makes sense for Wiktionary. (Oddly, the standard abbreviation for a direct object that's a thing is Ÿá‚Äç, which is also a letter "h" but in its combining form.)

== Breves in Ancient Greek ==

According to the [[Wiktionary:About_Ancient_Greek#Diacritics_and_accentuation|A.A.G. page]] and this [[Wiktionary_talk:About_Ancient_Greek/Archive_1#Breves_in_Templates|conversation]], breves and macrons in A.G. should be marked in the pronunciation, headword, and inflection tables, but not in the entry name.  When placing macrons in inflection tables, the [[Module:languages/data3/g|automatic linking]] will replace an ''·æ±'', ''·øë'', or ''·ø°'' with each's non-long form, but this is not the case for breves.  As such, an inflection table with breves will link to a page with a breve in the title.  Is there a reason breves have not been added into automatic linking, and if not, could an admin add them?  ‚Äî[[User:JohnC5|JohnC5]] <sup>([[User talk:JohnC5|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/JohnC5|contribs]])</sup> 07:39, 13 September, 2014 (UTC).

::::* "[Y]es we are indeed using breves in this dictionary‚Ä¶. Here's the reason: most of the Ancient Greek entries do not have any macrons or breves. So, a blank vowel needs to be assumed ambiguous. Thus, a blank vowel cannot be assumed to be short. Thus, breves must be allowed."

In the same way that the proposal to strip brachiae from Ancient Greek links has been extended to the stripping of breves from Latin links, it could be extended to the stripping of breves from Old English links (for Latin and Old English are, after all, both "extinct languages with phonemic vowel quantity and orthographic ambiguity with regard to vowel quantity"). Let's not be too hasty.

I'm no expert on the long and the short of Œ±, Œπ, œÖ; what I read is prose. But I do know a fairly long minimal pair. Œ£œÖŒΩŒ±ŒªŒπŒ∂œåŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ occurs in Acts 1:4. According to an appendix in the AENT, with a long Œ± it means "gathering with" (And gathering with [them], he told them...), but with a short Œ± it means "eating salt with" (I don't see "eating" and suspect it's "salting with", but have no occurrence in context).

: It doesn't have to mean "eating salt with". It can also mean "eating with". This example is a bit odd, because no one can agree on the exact meaning: apparently all three interpretations have problems. Yes, there's a third interpretation: as a variant of a verb meaning "to stay with". Still, the question here isn't whether length should be indicated, but whether it should be indicated by macron vs. absence of macron or macron vs. breve.

::I agree with not marking short vowels with breve. This is only ever done for extreme and deliberate clarification of a vowel length.

Any ambiguous vowels, which are rare, should be doubly marked (such as ·æ±ÃÜ ‚Äì note these may not show up well with some fonts).

::::: I think it just means "ambiguous vowel length", i.e. either of those two explanations. I don't really know if there is any real way to distinguish between those two, and to my knowledge no grammars or dictionaries do. In actual texts (both Greek and Latin), neither breve nor macra are included, and one just has to figure out which it is (although it is usually irrelevant). In many dictionaries, such as the Lewis and Short for Latin and the Middle Liddell for Greek, macra and breve are only used to disambiguate vowel qualities that are deemed not to be "obvious", for example the œÖ in œÉœÖŒΩ- is never marked in any compounds as it's always short. I disagree with this method because it assumes a certain level of knowledge of the user. They also do not mark vowels in closed syllables as these syllables are already heavy and the vowel's length is irrelevant for metrical purposes. I also disagree with this as it assumes that meter is the only reason one would want to know vowel length, and there are plenty of other scholarly reasons for wanting to know the length of the so-called "hidden vowels". I think most of us here agree that we should indicate as much information of the vowel quality as possible and let the user decide what they deem to be relevant and irrelevant information. The reason I mention this is to point out that sources and texts vary in their methods of marking vowel length. Textbooks do as well: the Hansen & Quinn leaves short vowels unmarked and marks long vowels with macra; the Athenaze never marks vowel length with macra or breve. I don't know of any sources who mark both short and long vowels and leave unmarked vowels for the far less frequent ambiguous vowel lengths, but I would like to know if anyone knows a text that does. Even so, my reasoning for not marking it is the convenience of not having to mark every vowel in most words. It might also be worth mentioning that marking vowels with both a length mark and with other diacritics is not easy to do in Unicode and doesn't always show up well, so I would suggest minimizing those cases to as few as possible.

* I '''oppose''' introduction of Visual Editor into English Wiktionary in any form other than as an opt-in.

*** Nice one. But I guess if there is a proposal, I will oppose it too <del>(even an opt-in)</del>, not on bureaucracy grounds, but because 1) it will encourage creation of manually-formatted entries by clueless users (i.e. <code><nowiki>'''paradise''' (''plural'' '''[[paradises]]''')</nowiki></code> plus manually added categories), which are error-prone and not malleable to mass conversions like adding lemma categories; and 2) it does not make it any easier to use the preferable method of formatting and categorising entries here, which is through templates. VE is fine (at least in principle; the actual implementation is rather obnoxious) for relatively free-form articles like there are on Wikipedia, but not for rigidly-templated Wiktionary entries.

== Noun5, really ? ==

Hi,

I am surprised to find an article anchor named "Noun5". I see in [[m:Help:Link#Anchors]] that anchors names are positional names, which, I guess, implies that adding a new section named "Noun" before the one with anchor name "Noun5" would make the "old Noun5" become "Noun6", and "Noun5" anchor would move to a new content.

It would be a lot more useful to include at least the language name in the anchor name, for example "EnglishNoun". And why not the whole hierarchy, for example "EnglishEtymology2Noun". 

At the moment I feel that linking to a wiktionary article subsection is pretty dangerous.

Regards.
: This is why we (should) avoid linking to subsections other than languages. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 16:09, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

: Since our entry structure isn't recognized by the wiki software, as long as the headers are done via wiki syntax, there's no way to guarantee the anchor automatically generated for non-unique headers, and only the language headers are unique. The workaround is to use a template that creates an additional anchor to link to. Aside from {{temp|anchor}}, There's also {{temp|senseid}}, which has more functionality and is better documented.

:::::::: I don't think there is an easy way that would fix this in all cases. It comes down to the fonts used. We can change the fonts used in page title headers, and maybe in edit boxes too. But of course that would be a rather major change, and even then it would be impossible to guarantee that everyone has that font, nor that the font can display every single possible character to begin with. For the edit box, the wiki specifies no font, so the default monospace font in your browser is used. If you change that font, it may fix it, but that's only going to work for your own computer, not the site in general.
:::::::: The wiki software allows us to override the displayed page title. This is already used in a few cases, like on prefix and suffix categories (just go to the category for a non-Latin script suffix and you may notice it). This means that it's theoretically possible for a template to apply script detection and the appropriate script classes/fonts to the title itself. But to do that, we'd have to include that template on every single mainspace page. So it can be done, but I don't know if it's worth the effort. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:48, 21 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::::: The above solution with including a template would only work when the page is viewed of course, not when it's edited. But if we don't want to include a template on every page, an alternative could be to add this functionality into {{temp|head}}. Every page contains this template, so it can do this too. I'm not sure what would happen when there are multiple instances of {{temp|head}} on the page; it's possible the software will protest and show an error if a page attempts to override the page title more than once. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 22:53, 21 September 2014 (UTC)

== References:The Bokm√•l Dictionary ==

I have a problem with certain words from the above reference being misread (by the template software?). It usually happens when two vowels are next to each other as in the case of {{l|nb|beboer}}. In this case 'oe' is being read as '√∏', and the word is therefore not being recognised by the dictionary. It can also happen with 'aa', which is read as '√•'. In fact any Bokm√•l words containing the characters √•, √¶ and √∏ are converted to 'aa' 'ae' and 'oe' respectively by the template software, but the dictionary usually copes with that. I think the same may happen with Nynorsk. Can a cure be found for this problem? [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 12:18, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
: It looks like the site itself is doing the conversion, prompted by the parameter "&alfabet=o". Is there a reason you include that? [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 12:40, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
:: Hmm, not necessarily. If I go directly to the dictionary website and type in "beboer" it is read as "beboer" by the dictionary. I think the problem is at this end. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 12:47, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
::: A further test. You get the message "Vi har dessverre ingen informasjon om ordet "beb√∏r" ...", but if you click on the Bokm√•l button the word comes up. A wee bit weird. [[User:Donnanz|Donnanz]] ([[User talk:Donnanz|talk]]) 12:57, 24 September 2014 (UTC)

::: If you look at the URL generated by the template, it has "oe": "http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=beboer&bokmaal=+&ordbok=bokmaal&alfabet=o". If you take out the "&alfabet=o", you get "http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=beboer&bokmaal=+&ordbok=bokmaal", which works. I suspect the "&alfabet=o" is for the purpose of accommodating those who can't easily produce the special characters on their keyboards. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 13:18, 24 September 2014 (UTC)

== [[Template:head]] linking things on either side of mid-dots ==

Possibly due to the changes which were made to [[Template:head]]/[[Module:headword]] a while ago (mentioned e.g. [[Wiktionary:Grease_pit#Red_link_headline_in_abbreviations|here]]), which expanded the set of 'probably multi-part' items which the template automatically linked the presumed parts of, terms like [[mo¬∑s]] now erroneously link to "[[mo]]" and "[[s]]" ‚Äî the mid-dot in fact indicates vowel length in Menominee and several other languages. Terms like [[al¬∑legoria]] are also erroneously split. How should this be fixed? I would suggest that the template/module be modified to treat a mid-dot as an indication of a morpheme break only for certain listed languages that use it for that purpose, or vice versa (to ''not'' treat it as a morpheme break only for certain listed languages that use mid-dots for other purposes) based on whichever list would be shorter. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 04:09, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
:I think the first way would be shorter. I don't know of any language other than Old Irish that uses the raised dot at a morpheme break, and even for Old Irish we only use the raised dot as part of the <code>head=</code> display, not in entry titles. And even if Old Irish ''did'' use the raised dot for entry titles, and we had entries like [[do¬∑beir]] instead of [[dobeir]], I still wouldn't want the headword line to display that as [[do]]¬∑[[beir]]. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 14:15, 29 September 2014 (UTC)

:OK, I've [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Module%3Aheadword&diff=29110777&oldid=29109211 excluded mid-dots entirely], since even in the one language that uses mid-dots as morpheme breaks they shouldn't cause breaks in the linking.

== Standardised interwiki prefixes now available ==

Just a heads up to let you know that a bug filed by Conrad Irwin back in 2009, [[bugzilla:21915|Please add ISO code interwikis for non-standard language codes]] has now been (at least partially) resolved. This means that the following ISO language code interwikis now function correctly:
*[[:vro:]], pointing to [[:fiu-vro:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
*[[:cmn:]], pointing to [[:zh:]]
*[[:lzh:]], pointing to [[:zh-classical:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
*[[:yue:]], pointing to [[:zh-yue:]]
*[[:rup:]], pointing to [[:roa-rup:]]
*[[:gsw:]], pointing to [[:als:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
*[[:be-tarask:]], pointing to [[:be-x-old:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
*[[:sgs:]], pointing to [[:bat-smg:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
*[[:egl:]], pointing to [[:eml:]] (although there is currently no Wiktionary edition in this language)
Hopefully this reduces the amount of special casing that is required in places like [[Module:wikimedia languages/data]].

For some yet-to-be-determined reason, a few ISO standard prefixes (such as [[:nb:]] and [[:nan:]]) are still not functioning correctly. I'm going to continue to look into this.

== Auto-add words with etymologies to [[WT:WE]] (wanted entries) by language ==

A Russian word {{m|ru|—Ñ—ÉÃÅ—Ö—Ç–µ–ª—å}} is derived from German {{m|de|Fuchtel}},  {{m|ru|—Ñ–∏–≥–ª—èÃÅ—Ä}} is from Polish {{m|pl|figlarz}} or {{m|ru|—à–∫–∏ÃÅ–ø–µ—Ä}} is from Dutch {{m|nl|schipper}}, which are all undefined at the moment. Could those red-linked words be automatically added to [[WT:WE]]? It would also help with some definitions and help improve entries in two languages. If spellings are wrong or a word doesn't exist, then etymologies in target languages could also be fixed. Alternatively or also, etymologies with red links type of categories by languages could be useful.

::::As I said above, I definitely know that checking the existence of a page is an expensive function (I'm using the Lua equivalent of {{#ifexist}}). But I really wanted to test this if it would work, so this is one reason why I created only a few categories ([[:Category:Russian redlinks]], [[:Category:English redlinks]], [[:Category:Portuguese redlinks]]), I wanted to see if it would be okay and if anyone would object.
::::Actually, I found 1 problem: [[water]] was displaying the "The time allocated for running scripts has expired." error, so I fixed it with a [[kludge]]: I edited the affected templates ({{temp|t}}, {{temp|t+}}, {{temp|l}} and {{temp|m}}) to make them ''not'' search for redlinks in the entry [[water]] specifically. The kludge worked. Also, the entry [[a]] is fine without needing to be an special exception like that. Can we measure the impact of [[Module:redlink category]] in our entries?

== How should numbers be sorted on Wiktionary? ==

Per [[phabricator:T8948]], it will eventually be possible to sort numerical page titles naturally (in numerical order) rather than lexigraphically (in strictly alphabetical order). We would like to know which type of sorting would be preferred on English Wiktionary. Should [[911]] come before or after [[99]] (assuming they were both in the same category)? [[User:Ryan Kaldari (WMF)|Ryan Kaldari (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Ryan Kaldari (WMF)|talk]]) 16:58, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
:IMO definitely use the order: 1, 2, 3, ..., 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... 99, 100, 101, ..., 911.
:The category [[:Category:Portuguese words by number of syllables]] has subcategories properly sorted. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 17:02, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
::(Note that this only works because the subcategories have custom sorting keys, thanks to {{tempn|poscatboiler}} ‚Äì the actual logic is somewhere deep in [[Module:category tree]], with the category names and corresponding sortkeys listed at [[Module:category tree/poscatboiler/data/words by number of syllables]]. [[User:Matma Rex|Matma Rex]] ([[User talk:Matma Rex|talk]]) 19:34, 1 March 2016 (UTC))
::: What about mixed numeric and alphabetic entry titles. How should those be sorted? Another complication is that really the sorting order logically depends on what the numbers mean in the entry title. [[911]] is a phone number and not actually the number "nine-hundred eleven", so really, it should come before [[99]]. In order to maintain consistency, I would say our only choice is to stick with the order: 1, 10, 100, 101, 11, 12, 2, 3, 8, 9, 911, 99. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 19:55, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
::::I disagree about 911 and think it should be between 910 and 912. It even has a Translingual number sense "the number nine hundred and eleven". At the very least, this should be the <s>standard</s> (I meant default) sorting. We can still use sortkeys for [[911]] to change that if we want.
::::[[:Category:E numbers]] should be able to be sorted automatically too, this way: [[E101]], [[E101a]], [[E400]], [[E620]], [[E1000]], [[E1001]].
::::File names in Microsoft Windows are able to do that. If you sort files by name, this is the order they end up in.

::It's harder to notice and thus [[bail in]] new(-to-us) interesting characters if the categories are only generated once the characters are noticed in entries and bailed in to some central list of interesting characters.

Maybe if it were used in the middle of a word, it would be interesting, but if it is used simply as an alpha, like [[Œ±-ray]], then I don't find that very interesting.

: A brief open letter to all people who are concerned about saving 8 keystrokes: Get AutoHotKey.  It is free (all the kinds) software which allows you to create all kinds of scripts and macros.  For instance, you can create a script which will detect when you type "{cpd|" and replace it with "<nowiki>{{compound|</nowiki>".  You can restrict the scripts to only function when editing a Wiktionary page in Chrome (or whatever).  You can also create hotkeys, for instance if you frequently speedy delete with the deletion reason "Nonsense/Gibberish" and not have to use the mouse at all.

== Redlinks categories ==

Yesterday, I was happily working my way through [[:Category:Italian redlinks]], adding missing terms, and making various types of correction. I finished the "A"s. Today, the category is empty. The same seems to be the case for all similar categories. There is one exception:- [[:Category:Russian redlinks]] still includes many Veps words. Any ideas? [[User:SemperBlotto|SemperBlotto]] ([[User talk:SemperBlotto|talk]]) 06:11, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|SemperBlotto}}: I can explain. I populated [[:Category:Italian redlinks]], but the code that checked for redlinks caused an error of "too many expensive functions" in almost 200 entries, so I emptied the redlink categories. If there's any nonempty redlink category, it's because the system didn't catch up to these categories yet.
:I intend to try and populate the redlinks categories again later, if I can possibly do it without causing any errors. I should definitely wait after all the reconstructed terms appendices are moved to the Reconstruction: namespace, because we're currently also using an expensive function to check for reconstructed terms in the Appendix: namespace.

*:Why does that have to be done in "real time" (ignoring the substantial latency delays) rather than by periodically (~monthly, quarterly, annually?) extracting lists from the XML dumps? Each language's page(s) could, for example, be one or more subpages of the "About" pages for the language. Even if one wanted to track new additions, that could be readily accomplished from the dumps. 
::I really don't see why we would want our own processes to be resource hogs on a regular basis. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  12:31, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:::If someone creates the full list of redlinks in all languages from the XML dump, then I suppose we won't need the categories.
:::I'm curious: is it verifiable that the ifexist is a resource hog? (especially when used repeatedly to check for redlinks in all pages) I know it's marked as an "expensive function", but using it didn't make the site slower to me or something like that. Does it flood the job queue or something?
:::Also, I'm thinking of a compromise. We can enable the redlink categories again, (after the Reconstruction: pages are done being moved to the new namespace) and if the site gets slower or something, we can disable the categories, but not before making a separate list of all members of these categories. It would be the same as creating a XML dump, but hopefully simpler/easier. --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel Carrero]] ([[User talk:Daniel Carrero|talk]]) 02:03, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

::::I don't give a rat's ass about a "compromise". I'd like to know what substantial advantage there is to having this real-time category instead of periodic updates from the dumps.

:::::Some people liked the idea and I'm ready to take it down if needed. (I took it down once) As I said before, it does not have to be real-time (in my opinion), it's just that I took the time to create the code that populates categories and I'm not really willing to try parsing dumps (I have 0 experience doing that, and this task in particular sounds difficult), but I welcome anyone to try and create the lists from dumps if they want. Again, if we had dumps we wouldn't need categories. To be clear: I'm totally for creating dumps, as long as someone else does it. You mentioned [[Special:WantedPages]], but it is kind of a mess; the redlink categories are organized by languages. Also, you're being dismissive in the last 2 sentences. ("to put it politely") Does anyone else basically thinks I'm being an idiot for presenting this idea after something related was requested in [[#Auto-add words with etymologies to WT:WE (wanted entries) by language]]?

::::::Don't get me started.

::::::I'd hate to think that your choice of approaches to solving problems was as limited by the range of tools you know as mine is.

All it takes is a few minutes time for downloading, an unzipping tool, a language like Perl or Python that supports and extends regular expressions, and the ability to use these. What is remarkable to me is that a useful list can be produced in less than a minute on one's own PC.

:::Thank you, {{Ping|Vahagn Petrosyan}}! You light up the correct direction of our discussion. I agree with applying the transliteration in [[Template:R:tut-pro:SDM]] to every Turkic language.

*{{Ping|Vahagn Petrosyan}} Also needed to be mentioned is I've never tried to reconstruct phonology in transliteration. In whatever Turkic language /…™/ should be transliterated as the major i sound in the destination alphabet (in our case, Roman). The problem is in many Turkic languages, such as in Uyghur, [i] is homophoneme with […™], i.e. /i/=/…™/. So it seems as if [i] should be transliterated as i, which is not the case. The definite Khakassian vowel shift is /e/->[i], which results in the failure of the relation /i/=/…™/. So /…™/->i should be kept while /i/ should be assigned with some other letter in our transliteration. 
*The original writer of the current transliteration is an Anatolian native speaker, whose homeland is far away from the heartland of Turkic world, and might not have a very deep understanding of Turkic phonology. If you pronounce a [i] to an native Uyghur speaker, most likely (might depend on dialect) s/he will think it to be a consonant [j] and correct your pronunciation. If you'd love to, you can ping the original writter to ask whether he agrees to transliterate /…™/ as i while /i/ as something else.
*What I requested, to use an English-like (rather than the current ƒ∞ngl√≠sh-like) transliteration, is totally natural in both Khakas and English, and has nothing to do with phonologial reconstruction. Can you say our current English alphabet is a phonological reconstruction? --[[Special:Contributions/129.236.208.216|129.236.208.216]] 01:39, 12 March 2016 (UTC)

== Previewing Tables ==

I often edit translation tables, and find it somewhat annoying that I cannot expand any sort of table when previewing an edit, which sometimes means I inadvertently save edits with broken templates, and have to make multiple edits before I finally figure out how to fix it.

Now, I was editing an article while logged out of my account, and I realized that I was able to expand the tables while previewing the edit. I logged in, and was no longer able to do so. Why is this? Why is it no longer possible to expand tables when I'm logged in? Is it just my browsers (Firefox and Opera)? [[User:Andrew Sheedy|Andrew Sheedy]] ([[User talk:Andrew Sheedy|talk]]) 07:05, 12 March 2016 (UTC)
: I have no such problem (Firefox, on a Mac). I suspect it's a gadget, preference, or something in your common.js- those are the main account-specific customizations. It might not even be something directly associated with the boxes: If I remember correctly, the templates add a specific css class, which triggers javascript that first creates the boxes, then adds the control that lets you expand or collapse the box. I believe that something that causes an error which stops the js execution before it adds the control would prevent the boxes from being expandable.

Latin inflection tables (see ''[[albus]]'') have become garish, with dark colours that make it hard to see the text of some of the forms (perhaps especially for colourblind people). We have historically avoided vivid or deep colours in inflection tables (see e.g. [[Template talk:eo-conj]] for some evidence of this norm). Let's tone the Latin tables down.

::Do we really agree with the premise of having all inflections with the same ending share the same background color? If we do, we are more or less forced to a accept a patchwork look. The first 6-8 different endings can probably be distinguished with only hue differences (all pale and therefore less garish), but after that light and dark or high and low saturation would probably be required and garishness is more likely.

== Semi-automatic Thai transliteration ==

The new module [[Module:th-pron]] and [[Module:th-translit]] transliterate Thai terms with mostly phonetic respellings (Thai pronunciation rules are very complicated, full of exceptions and irregular pronunciations).

Anyway, when a term is defined with {{temp|th-pron}}, it can be transliterated automatically and correctly (there is a small number of homonyms with different pronunciations, though). It relies on [[Module:links]]. I think these features should be documented and editors be aware of the special case, only for Thai.

Some points: 
# Semi-automatic transliterations override manual in {{temp|t}}, {{temp|t+}}, {{temp|l}}, {{temp|m}}
# {{temp|th-l}} is designed for Thai, it also take phonetic respellings (p=) as a parameter (currently being fixed? but was working). It needs to work, so that incorrect automatic transliteration could be overridden with phonetic respellings.
# Undefined monosyllabic terms are automatically transliterated but there are occasional incorrect transliterations.
# It's not 100% perfect yet, some phonetic respelling rules need to be reviewed, especially the use of vowel shortener when there are other diacritics or letter "[[‡∏´]]" is silent and used to convert consonants to high class. Should only "‡∏´‡∏∫" with anusvara be used in such cases?
# The more terms are defined using the new methods, the more accurate the transliterations get. Usage examples with {{temp|th-x}} rely on existing terms.

Calling editors involved or who may be interested: {{ping|Wyang|Iudexvivorum|Octahedron80|‡∏´‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏î‡∏ã‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏ï‡πâ|Alifshinobi|kc kennylau|Hippietrail|Lo Ximiendo|YURi}}. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 23:02, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

== [[WT:PREFS]] cookies ==

As a result, prefs don't run on many pages. Just switching <code>wiktSetPrefCookie</code> to use the correct path now doesn't work, because the more local cookies are still around, and take priority when being accessed, but newly set cookies wouldn't override them, and would instead just be duplicated.

== Verbal arguments ==

Lots of verbs in Ancient Greek, Old Norse, and Icelandic (and other languages) take oblique cases as "subjects" or non-accusative cases as "objects": for instance, {{m|is|√æykja}}, {{m|grc|Œ¥ŒøŒ∫Œ≠œâ}} take dative of "subject" in at least some of their senses.

== [[:Template:compound]] doesn't categorize prefixes ==

[[:Template:compound]] doesn't categorize prefixes. Probably also suffixes. As such it is often used inappropriately. A solution would be to revert it to a version that doesn't allow the arbitrary inclusion of morphemes without creating an obvious, but not catastrophic-looking display problem. A better solution would be appropriate categorization for prefixes, suffixes and interfixes (forgoing the categorization for other morphemes).

== Ancient Greek dialect labels ==

I've been using {{temp|label}}, {{temp|term-label}}, and the {{para|from}} parameter in {{temp|alt form of}} for labeling dialects in Ancient Greek entries. At first, these templates would automatically link and categorize words in dialect-specific categories, but now that is no longer working. I think this is because I moved the labels to [[Module:labels/data/subvarieties]]. Apparently the subvarieties labels are not recognized by {{temp|label}}, {{temp|term-label}}, and {{temp|alt form of}}. Could this be fixed? Labels are such a convenient way to label and categorize words in dialectal categories.

== Searching for Ancient Greek forms ==

It's really frustrating that the search bar can't find Ancient Greek forms with different accent marks. This is particularly a problem since we list Ancient Greek inflected forms with macrons and breves. So, if someone is searching for {{m|grc||·º±ŒµœÅŒ≠Œ±|pos=accusative singular}}, a form that will occur in Ancient Greek texts online, they won't find the lemma form {{m|grc|·º±ŒµœÅŒµœçœÇ||priest|pos=nominative singular}}, because the accusative singular is listed in the inflection table as {{m|grc||·º±ŒµœÅŒ≠·æ±}}, with a macron on the final vowel.

Similarly, if they search for {{m|grc||ŒπŒµœÅŒµœÖœÇ}}, without any diacritics, a bunch of Modern Greek forms will pop up in the search bar, but if they select "containing ŒπŒµœÅŒµœÖœÇ" at the bottom, no entries will show up (just someone's [[User:Dubaduba~enwiktionary/Strong's Greek|list of Strong's Greek words]]).

This is different from the Latin alphabet: if you search "etre" and select "containing etre", the correct entry {{m|fr|√™tre}} shows up as the second option (under {{m|fr|etre}}). That's what should happen with Greek.

I vaguely remember people discussing this, maybe on the [[Wiktionary talk:About Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek talk page]], but nothing has been about it, so I thought I'd complain in a more public place. Is there a way to fix this problem, so people can find Ancient Greek forms listed in entries, or headwords, even if they have typed the wrong diacritics (or even the right diacritics, just without macrons and breves)? ‚Äî [[w:en:User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 00:32, 28 March 2016 (UTC)
:The only solution I can think of probably won't be very popular: to strip all diacritics from both Modern and Ancient Greek. Then both Modern {{l|el|ŒπŒµœÅŒ≠Œ±œÇ}} and Ancient {{l|grc|·º±ŒµœÅŒ≠·æ±œÇ}} would be at [[ŒπŒµœÅŒµŒ±œÇ]] (with hard redirects from the forms with diacritics) and would show their diacritics only in their headword lines as well as when mentioned in {{tl|l}}, {{tl|m}}, {{tl|t}}, etc. But I suspect this proposal will meet with general disapproval, which is why I've never actually proposed it. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 07:04, 28 March 2016 (UTC)

In cases like [[Œ≤Œ¨œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ±]] where there is only one form with diacritics, the hard redirect [[[[Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ±]]]] could go straight to [[Œ≤Œ¨œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ±]] rather than to a disambiguating appendix. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 10:24, 6 April 2016 (UTC)

== {{temp|lo-verb}} lacks a "head" parameter ==

== TTS dictionaries from Wiktionary IPA representations ==

(At Grease pit because it's essentialy a technicaly related request)

I found that a "free software" program called E-Speak A TTS and synthetic speech generator was being re-worked.

https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng

The number of languages it supports it's supports is quite high.

Is there any interest in Wiktionary contributors, also helping to improve the dictionaries E-SpeakNG has for translating words from text to speech?

I'd also like to ask if there's anyone on Wikitionary that has familiarity with Australian vocal dialects as Australian English doesn't seem to be represented in Espeak-NG yet, and adding a new "voice" requires some specfic technical knowledge concerning the characteristics.

For the dictionary consult,  
https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/dictsource/pt_list  and https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/dictsource/pl_rules

The former is a list of specifcaly encoded words, the later is some general rules for particular syallable and groups to save defining very similar words individually, Not sure how compounding works in Portugese so.

Basicly this is probably where you would need to add or amend stuff.

The phoneme data is at :-

https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/phsource/ph_pt_brazil is the phoneme not-quite-lo level details of the phonemes.  You may need this to work out what's supported as a specfic phoneme sound to encode in the dictionary.

With documentation here - https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/add_language.md

For the "voice" details try here under the relevant ISO 639-5 code (for the "suggested" language family)  namely - https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/espeak-data/voices/roa/pt-BR


Basicly you build up a set of phoneme data and dictionary rules and then compile certain data files to make a compiled databsse. The exact details of how to make Formanant files aren't documented, as they use an external espeakedit program

** MediaWiki has no input in Wiktionary's font choices. All the font-related CSS styles are locally hosted in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]].

[[MediaWiki:Mobile.css]] contains very little, none of it font-related. So, in the mobile version non-Latin-script mentions are italicized (example: [https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84%D8%A7_%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%84%D8%A7#Arabic {{m|ar||ÿ£ŸáŸÑÿß Ÿàÿ≥ŸáŸÑÿß

**:: I don't understand what you mean. Doesn't a given font (say, Times New Roman) look roughly the same on a computer and on a tablet or phone?
**:: And as far as I know MediaWiki has nothing to do with font selection. There might be a default font for the site, but besides that and the font selections that we have added to our CSS pages, browsers are what select which fonts are used for which characters. And they in turn can only select fonts that the user actually has on their device (ignoring web fonts).

== Automatic listing of languages that use a transliteration module ==

Transliteration module documentation pages will now automatically list all languages that use the module, as long as the module is listed either in the language's data file or in the data module [[Module:translit-redirect/data]]. The module will also have a category added for each language. Till now, categorization was inconsistent for modules used by more than one language.

Also, for curiosity's sake, modules are categorized by how many languages use them. The record seems to be held by [[Module:Ital-translit]], which is used by 12 languages.

The system isn't perfect: some languages have a dedicated module for one of their scripts, but also redirect to another module.

== [[Template:ga-noun]] creating spurious "whatlinkshere"s (but only three?) ==

Check out [[Special:WhatLinksHere/~a]] and [[Special:WhatLinksHere/~e]]. There are hundreds of pages there, all of which use {{tl|ga-noun}} and the parameter <code>|~a</code> or <code>|~e</code>. However, if you look at the actual pages, they don't have links to [[~a]] and [[~e]], because the template knows to convert them to <code>&#91;[&#123;{PAGENAME}}a]]</code> and <code>&#91;[&#123;{PAGENAME}}e]]</code>. So why are the "whatlinkshere"s being created? And how can we stop them from being created? To make the phenomenon even weirder, {{tl|ga-noun}} uses other similar shortcuts like <code>|~√≠</code>, but those ''aren't'' creating spurious "whatlinkshere"; [[Special:WhatLinksHere/~√≠]] is empty, even though that parameter is also used on hundreds of pages.

== What are the advantages to the Reconstruction namespace? ==

(Apart from letting us adhere to the letter of the rule "only attested terms in mainspace"). A user on da.wikt [[:da:Brugerdiskussion:B_Lemeux#stof|may be interested]] in adding reconstructions (which we currently do not have there), but was unsure how to do so. If we all use special namespaces, we can use sitelinks, but da.wikt and eo.wikt (and probably many other versions) do not even currently have appendices. If we all use mainspace (and the same transcription standards), we can let Cognate do all the work. If neither of those, we need to go back to interwikilinks (which is not currently being maintained, see e.g. [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/deyw√≥s]]/[[:es:*deyw√≥s]]).<br/>
So, what are the advantages?__[[User:Gamren|Gamren]] ([[User talk:Gamren|talk]]) 14:40, 10 August 2017 (UTC)
:We find it useful to have reconstructions in a dedicated namespace; the solution at es.wikt, for example, marks reconstructions with the asterisk in namespace and thus confuses them with something like {{m|en|:*band}} (yes, that is a word in English). For us, linking between Wiktionaries is a somewhat secondary concern, and also one that will probably be solved fairly soon for all namespaces, I think. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 17:28, 11 August 2017 (UTC)

== Some questions about adding audio recording of words pronunciation ==
Hi, I'm from the Hebrew Wiktionary team. 
I also took part in writing a site for easy recording of mass of words from a lists: [https://lingualibre.fr/ https://lingualibre.fr/] (only French UI at the moment).

I wanted to know whether there is already an extension or a bot for uploading audios of words pronunciation to wiktionaries ?
I think that an extension where users can record words and add it directly from the wikitionary page just like with editing, could be really cool.

Also, there is this site of words pronunciation [https://forvo.com/ forvo] , I wanted to know if it is allowed to write a bot that import audio from there to wikicommon?

Thanks

: I'm thinking the idea related to digraphs could work. In the sortkey, we would convert each digraph or trigraph (or tetragraph, pentegraph) to an arbitrary character that doesn't appear in entry names. Then the new extension would correctly order the sortkeys using a language-specific collation order, and it would generate the headings by converting the arbitrary characters back into the digraphs and trigraphs that they represent.
: For instance, {{m|hu|dzsessz|t=jazz}} could have the sortkey <code>‚ÇÅe‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ</code>, in which <code>‚ÇÅ</code> represents the trigraph ''dzs'' and <code>‚ÇÇ</code> represents the digraph ''sz''. (I'm not sure if this is the way a Hungarian dictionary would handle the double consonant ''ssz''. Maybe the sortkey should use <code>s‚ÇÇ</code> instead.) <code>‚ÇÅ</code> would be ranked after <code>e</code> in the extension, while <code>‚ÇÇ</code> would be ranked after <code>s</code>. And instead of placing the entry {{m|hu|dzsessz}} under the heading '''‚ÇÅ''', it would convert that symbol back to '''DZS''' and use that as the heading instead.
: This would require that the collation extension be coordinated with whatever Lua module generates the sortkeys (currently, for most languages, [[Module:languages]] combined with the sortkey data from the language's data table). That is, whatever generates Hungarian sortkeys would have a list of correspondences between the digraphs or trigraphs and the arbitrary characters chosen to represent them in sortkeys, and the collation extension would have, in its data for the language code <code>hu</code>, an identical list to convert back from the sortkey characters to the digraphs or trigraphs. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 18:10, 12 August 2017 (UTC)

:::: Also I think it would be preferable in at least some cases to handle digraphs, trigraphs, etc. through sortkeys, rather than having the collation extension automatically consider all possible instances of the correct group of letters as a letter: I suspect that there are languages in which a sequence of letters is sometimes a digraph and sometimes not.
:::: For instance, {{m+|sh|nad≈æ√≠veti}} and {{m|sh|p√≥dzƒìmlje}} might have instances of ''d'' + ''≈æ'' and ''d'' + ''z'' rather than the digraphs ''d≈æ'' and ''dz'', as the ''d'' is at the end of a prefix.

:I'm using Firefox browser with the Vector skin. For the past week or so, I have had trouble with the Watchlist options (appears at the top of the Special/Watchlist page. In the options, you can select your watchlist according to various lengths of time, such as 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and so on:
::''Watchlist options''

== Wanted: Gadget to speed linkification ==

As I add taxonomic names, I try to linkify any existing entry (actually L2 section) that uses the taxon, but does not link to it. It would be a help to be able to do that, say, from the entry page or from an entry creation page, without have to type the entry name and to obtain a list only containing the taxon not already linked. It would be nice if not only bare links, but also taxa enclosed in templates such as {{temp|taxlink}}, {{temp|m}}, {{temp|l}} were excluded. 

It would seem likely that it be possible. Obviously, it would be a resource hog for terms of wide use, like letters, many short words, and function words. Perhaps short terms in Latin and similar scripts at least could be excluded. Would it still be a resource hog? [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 21:01, 15 August 2017 (UTC)

== Number of modules invoked and Lua memory errors ==

Part of the reason for so much Lua memory usage is the number of modules that are required or have their data loaded in another Lua module, because there is additional memory used by the {{code|lua|require()}} or {{code|lua|mw.loadData}} functions beyond the size of the module itself.

I don't know how much memory each one requires. I thought it might be a half megabyte based on a test I did once, but that could be wrong. If anyone more digitally astute can find a way to get a more precise figure, that would be nice.

The memory used to transclude each module might explain why pages like [[air]], which invokes 69 transliteration modules, mostly in the Translations sections, use so much memory. ([[air|Air]] is currently at 47.95 MB, and it went over the limit until recently, when I switched many of the Latin translations to the non-Lua template {{temp|t-simple}}.)

Some of this memory could be freed up, then, by merging some of the transliteration modules, so that fewer modules have to be transcluded. There are some candidates that I noticed when I was going through the transliteration modules reformatting and simplifying the code. First, there are quite a few non-Slavic Cyrillic-script transliteration modules, probably for languages spoken in the former Soviet Union, that have similar code for handling iotated vowels. These could be merged to a single module with a bunch of tables for language-specific replacements. Second, there are a number of modules for languages using Canadian syllabics that are really small; they should be combined with the main module. Third, any modules that simply replace each letter with its Latin equivalent ([[Module:Phnx-translit]], [[Module:Cher-translit]]) could be easily handled by a single module.

Merging the modules would make it somewhat harder to find the module for a particular language: instead of typing the language code and <code>-translit</code>, people will have to navigate to the correct module using the {{catlink|Modules by language}} categories. That's already the case for certain modules that are titled with script rather than language codes (for instance, [[Module:Armn-translit]]), so it's not a problem in my opinion.

This proposal wouldn't finally solve the memory problem, but would at least defer the final reckoning. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 22:13, 15 August 2017 (UTC)

== "Declension", "Personal forms" or what -  a question to grammar wizards ==

In Finnish there's a class of adverbs that require a [[possessive suffix]] which reflects the person of the subject of the sentence. For example, {{m|fi|hyvill√§√§n||pleased}}:

{| class="wikitable"
 | Olen hyvill√§'''[[-ni|ni]]'''.    || I'm pleased.
 |-
 | Olet hyvill√§'''[[-si|si]]'''. || You are pleased.
 |-
 | H√§n on hyvill√§'''[[-√§n|√§n]]'''. || He/she is pleased.
|-
 | Olemme hyvill√§'''[[-mme|mme]]'''. || We are pleased.
|-
 | Olette hyvill√§'''[[-nne|nne]]'''. || You are pleased.
|-
 | He ovat hyvill√§'''[[-√§n|√§n]]'''. || They are pleased.
 |}

A comprehensive list of this type of adverbs can be found here: [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:fi-decl-pred-adv]].

On each of these pages there's a table showing these forms. The header for the table is currently "Declension". I wonder if that is the correct term, or should the header be something else, like "Personal forms". --[[User:Hekaheka|Hekaheka]] ([[User talk:Hekaheka|talk]]) 07:42, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

== Misplacement of furigana ==

I found that the third example sentence in the page [[„ÅÇ„Çã]] has misplaced furiganas, which I am not sure how to correct:

----

{{ja-usex|ÁßÅ„ÅÆÂ≠¶Ê†°„ÅØËä±Âúí„Åå'''„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô'''„ÄÇ|„Çè„Åü„Åó „ÅÆ „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ „ÅØ „ÅØ„Å™„Åû„ÅÆ „Åå '''„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô'''„ÄÇ|My school '''has''' a flower garden.}}

<div style="width: 23em; border: 2px dotted green; padding: 1em;">
Solution:

{{ja-usex|ÁßÅ„ÅÆÂ≠¶Ê†° „ÅØ Ëä±Âúí„Åå'''„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô'''„ÄÇ|„Çè„Åü„Åó „ÅÆ „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ „ÅØ „ÅØ„Å™„Åû„ÅÆ „Åå '''„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô'''„ÄÇ|My school '''has''' a flower garden.}}
</div>

----

This seems to be a systematic error. It goes like this:

When a part of the sentence is of the sequence ''kanji-kana-kanji'', and the first kana of the second kanji is identical to the standalone kana, the standalone kana is erroneously shown as part of the first kanji's furigana, and the first kana of the second kanji is displayed as the standalone kana.

So, as the example has it,

...gakkou ha hanazono...

is mistakenly reanalyzed as

...gakkouha ha nazono...

even though the source code is correct. I cannot access the visual editor for some reason, so that is all I have. If I change the second ''ha'' to something like ''ga'', the sequence of furiganas is correct. And since the algorithm seems to ignore spaces to first match for the kanas, changing the standalone ''ha'' to something else like ''sa'' does not correct the mistaken reanalysis.

I hope I have made myself clear.

Could this be fixed soon?

In the second case, the kanji {{ja-l|Âºü}} are centered below the three or two kana that indicate their pronunciation, while in the first the two kana are centered below all five kana. (This is more obvious in the HTML.) I think in this case the module should try to figure out which kana belong with which individual kanji, rather than centering each group of kanji below the sequence of kana that correspond to them.
::::: Moraic and syllabic analysis of the kana could play a part. For instance, in the current example, perhaps the module could calculate that the sequence {{ja-r|„Åç„Çá„ÅÜ„Å†„ÅÑ}} consisted of four morae ({{lang|ja|„Åç„Çá„ÄÅ„ÅÜ„ÄÅ„Å†„ÄÅ„ÅÑ}}). And secondly (as already mentioned), if {{ja-l|„Å£}} and {{ja-l|„Çì}} are involved, the module should consider them and the previous mora to constitute a syllable, which then cannot be divided between kanji. Perhaps then these morae or syllables could be divided up equally between kanji. In the example above, it would give the right result. In other cases, it might not, in which case percents would be required. But it would be good for the module to ''try'' to figure out which kana belong to which kanji, instead of doing what it does now. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 19:56, 21 August 2017 (UTC)

The developers are now investigating how important it is to override global preferences locally, which would mean you set a preference for ''almost'' all wikis but still have different settings on one or a few wikis. Maybe because you‚Äôre more active on one wiki, maybe because you edit in different ways there. If you want to be able to set exceptions to global preferences it is important that you tell the developers this now. Tell them what, how you‚Äôd use it and why it is important [[m:Talk:Community_Tech/Global_preferences|on this talk page]].

This is only necessary if you want global preferences ''and'' exceptions to them. If you only edit one wiki, or are happy having the same preferences everywhere, you can ignore this.

The reason they‚Äôre asking is it‚Äôs technically complicated to build. /[[User:Johan (WMF)|Johan (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Johan (WMF)|talk]]) 15:38, 28 August 2017 (UTC)

: I have never yet needed local overrides (in about a decade). I actually find it mildly annoying each time I go to a new wiki and get the alert flag (red thing at top-right) for messages on ''other'' wikis, because I haven't yet set "only show local messages" in my global settings at the new wiki.

: {{Ping|Johan (WMF)}} Thanks for asking! If global preferences are implemented, I would certainly use them, and I would certainly want local overrides. The preferences I use on Wiktionary and Wikipedia are slightly different, and I wouldn't want differences like that to prevent me from benefiting from global preferences. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 15:45, 28 August 2017 (UTC)

== Pronunciation evaluation gadget for Wiktionary: GSoC 2017 ==

Every dictionary need to provide phonetic representation of a word along with its written form. With advanced speech recognition tools now available, it's also possible to evaluate and correct user's pronunciation. I have shown it in a live demo hosted [https://brijmohan.github.io/iremedy/single_line.html here]. I request the admins to grant me permission to create a Gadget which will evaluate the pronunciation of a user within Wiktionary. Here's how the gadget will look like. [[File:Wiktionary pronunce interface.png|thumb]].

I want to create a page: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-pronunce.js
This page will contain the contents of https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Brijsri/common.js.

Finally, I would like to publish it as a gadget. Thanks for the help.

: This is interesting to me. I am less interested with the idea of 'correcting' pronunciation than in evaluating pronunciation and producing valid IPA representation. That is, allow contributors to add regional/dialectic variant pronunciations via a gadget. e.g. Parisian vs. Qu√©becois, Delhi vs. London, etc. - [[User:Amgine|Amgine]]/<sup> [[User talk:Amgine|t]]&middot;[[Special:EmailUser/Amgine|e]]</sup> 15:17, 30 August 2017 (UTC)


: Thanks for the suggestions. I will incrementally implement these requirements. Kindly create this page (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-pronunce.js) so that I can proceed with the development. Thanks! {{unsigned|Brijsri}}
:: You need to be an admin to edit MediaWiki namespace. As for your script it won't become a gadget until it is well tested.

== saving memory on Chinese entries ==

{{ping|Erutuon|Rua|Suzukaze-c}} I haven't ever looked into the Chinese modules to see whether they can be made more efficient. I'm looking into them now and some things immediately come to mind. For example, [[Module:zh/data/cmn-pron]] consists of a big table mapping characters into their pronunciations. This represents the pronunciations using strings like "b«êng" but there are only around 1400 possible Mandarin syllables. Instead of using a Lua table, we could use a large string where every Han character takes 2 bytes (encoding a Mandarin syllable). There are 20,992 Unicode characters, which are in a continuous block from 0x4e00 to 0x9fff. Looking up a Chinese character just means computing the Unicode index, subtracting 0x4e00, multiplying by 2 and looking up the 2-byte syllable index at that byte position. This should take around 42K for the string plus maybe another 40K (at most) for the Mandarin syllable map. This is certainly far less memory than required to hold a 20,000-entry map. Similar things could be done with all the other pronunciation modules. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 21:15, 3 October 2020 (UTC)
: This seems like a good idea. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 08:45, 4 October 2020 (UTC)
:: {{re|Benwing2}} We could probably try, but I think the only thing that's actively using that data module is {{temp|zh-x}} (which is still used a lot, so maybe it might make a difference). Otherwise, that table is just used for inferring Mandarin pronunciations when creating entries, if I'm not mistaken. ‚Äî&nbsp;[[User:Justinrleung|justin(r)leung]]&nbsp;<sub>{&nbsp;[[User_talk:Justinrleung|(t...)]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Justinrleung|c=‚Ä∫]]&nbsp;}</sub> 12:07, 4 October 2020 (UTC)
: It's worth a try and I like the idea of using simpler text formats just for editability. I'm doubtful that it will make a difference, though. [[Module:zh/data/cmn-pron]] is only ever loaded with <code>mw.loadData</code> and that means that the big table is generated only once per page. And aside from the size of the module table and the memory used when executing the data module (once per page), the cost of <code>mw.loadData</code> is proportional to how many times each table in the data module is accessed, but there are only two tables in [[Module:zh/data/cmn-pron]]. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 20:10, 4 October 2020 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Erutuon|Justinleung}} My thought was to do something similar with all the pronunciation modules; together this could save several MB's if each table takes around 1MB in its current structure. Many of the pages in [[:CAT:E]] throw errors only near the end so this could make the difference. I remember also that when I used <code>mw.loadData</code> on some data modules related to {{temp|place}}, it actually *increased* the memory usage by several MB's. We should try loading the modules not using <code>mw.loadData</code> to see what happens. Any thoughts as to which other modules could be the culprits, if not the pronunciation modules?

All of them can be optimized; not necessarily all the same way, but (for all but [[Module:zh/data/dial]]) they can be converted to have all their data in a single string. Most of them consist of string-to-string mappings; essentially, store all the data in a big string with keys and values alternating, with the keys sorted lexicographically, and binary search through the string to find the appropriate key. This is not quite as easy as just looking up in a table, but the code to do the binary search can be reused. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 03:49, 5 October 2020 (UTC)

== Glitch in Tea Room ==

Today when I go to [[Wiktionary:Tea_room]], the thread "over my dead body" seems to have been corruptly partially duplicated at the bottom of the page (this duplicate is not present in [[Wiktionary:Tea_room/2020/October]]). Also, when I click the "Edit" link next to the duplicate "over my dead body" heading, I get a warning "You are editing the main Tea room page. If you want to create a new discussion or contribute to an existing discussion, please go to Wiktionary:Tea room/2020/October instead."

== female equivalent of ==

{{tl|female equivalent of}} should capitalize the word ''female'' by default.  In the context where it is used our style wants an initial capital letter.  [[User:Vox Sciurorum|Vox Sciurorum]] ([[User talk:Vox Sciurorum|talk]]) 12:03, 14 October 2020 (UTC)
:{{ping|Vox Sciurorum}} Unfortunately there's no consistency in the style of our form-of templates. Some use an initial capital, some don't; some default to a final period, some don't. See [[:Category:Form-of templates]]. In fact, none of the related "feminine X of" templates take an initial capital letter. In general I'd prefer that these templates don't take a capital letter; IMO it looks wrong esp. in foreign-language glosses, and it causes problems if you have a preceding label.

== Strange behavior of the id parameter ==

When I click on a suffix that has an id parameter assigned to it, I expect the browser to jump exactly to the location where the senseid is assigned. This works fine on Android devices (haven't tested in Windows). However, in Apple desk computers and mobile devices it doesn't always jump to the blue-highlighted section but way below it and I have to scroll up to see the actual section. On my desktop, I do see the blue section for a fraction of a second, then there is an extra jump half page down. I don't know if it is just my computer. My software is up to date. Would someone please test this to confirm? Test cases: 1. '''[[k√©rge]]'''. Click on the -e suffix in the etymology section. A large jump down. 2. '''[[h√°za]]'''. Click on the -a suffix (slightly different behavior, smaller jump, the blue section is much larger in this case.) 3. '''[[megh√≠vok]]'''. Click on the -ok suffix. This behaves perfectly, it jumps to the blue section and stays there. I can't figure it out. [[User:Panda10|Panda10]] ([[User talk:Panda10|talk]]) 16:49, 16 October 2020 (UTC)

:I believe it's because there are expandable/collapsible tables (or other content) above the linked-to section; the page loads with them expanded and the correct section displayed onscreen, and then when the code which collapses them loads and they collapse, the screen is left in the wrong place.

:::::{{ping|GianWiki}} From my perspective: (1) It's badly named, as it suggests it refers to noun lemma pluralia tantum rather than to noun forms; (2) it's limited in usage, and has a non-standard calling convention (where e.g. 'f' stands for 'f-p'); (3) in general we try to avoid a proliferation of templates for non-lemma forms. Some people don't even like using 'noun plural form' but prefer 'noun form', and don't like specifying genders in non-lemma forms, reasoning that the gender is always available on the headword, one click away. I enabled accelerator support for Italian nouns; if you turn on the accelerator gadget and the orange links gadget, any Italian plural form that doesn't exist will show as green in the inflection portion of the lemma headword, and clicking on it will auto-fill the plural with the appropriate entry.

: We'd all like to know that. Unfortunately, it's not just you. In general, the templates used in Chinese and Japanese entries take lots of memory.

I think this should have [[:Category:Terms attributed to a specific source by language]] as a parent. For example, [[:Category:English coinages]] should have [[:Category:English terms attributed to a specific source]] as a parent. {{ping|Surjection}}?

Also, I find it rather weird that [[:Category:French terms coined by Jean de la Fontaine]] has [[:Category:Terms coined by Jean de la Fontaine by language]] as a parent. I find it highly unlikely that a single person would have coined long-lasting terms in several different languages; if it did happen, it must have been an extremely rare occurrence.

And finally, I fear [[:Category:French terms coined by Jean de la Fontaine]] is a misnomer; the members of that category are expressions that originated from his fables rather than terms specifically coined by him. [[:Category:French terms derived from the Fables of Jean de la Fontaine]] would be a better fit, on the model of [[:Category:English terms derived from the Bible]].

== Suppressing spurious bullet character ==

The etymology section at [[down#Etymology_1]] starts with a spurious bullet character, which is for some reason generated by or as a result of a "senseid" template. I don't know whether the "senseid" template is correctly used in this position, or what alternative could or should be used to create the same effect, or how the bullet point could otherwise be suppressed. Perhaps someone might have an idea. [[User:Mihia|Mihia]] ([[User talk:Mihia|talk]]) 19:28, 18 October 2020 (UTC)
* [[:Module:senseid]] generates <nowiki><li></nowiki>.  Should it use <nowiki><a></nowiki> instead? [[User:Vox Sciurorum|Vox Sciurorum]] ([[User talk:Vox Sciurorum|talk]]) 21:02, 18 October 2020 (UTC)
*: It probably makes more sense to have it not generate a bullet, and use normal formatting to add a bullet if/where needed. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 21:45, 18 October 2020 (UTC)
*:: It might be producing LI so that the entire definition lights up when you follow a link. See the example at the template docs. This wouldn't be possible if it was an A. ‚Äî[[User:Suzukaze-c|Suzukaze-c]] ([[User talk:Suzukaze-c|talk]]) 22:05, 18 October 2020 (UTC)
*::: Ah. Could we have it produce a class of li that we could use css to suppress the display of a bullet on? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 01:17, 19 October 2020 (UTC)
*:::: We need to suppress the bullet if the template is going to be placed outside of definitions, but it's best not to put li tags outside of lists (ul or ol tags) because it's bad HTML and someone like [[User:ShakespeareFan00]] will have to eventually come and fix them. In [[down#Etymology 1]], {{temp|senseid}} should create a p tag instead (this p tag will merge with the p tag inserted by MediaWiki at the beginning of paragraphs), and that tag should also be highlighted. (That can be achieved by making the <code>senseid</code>-related rule in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] apply to p tags.) Then we will have to note to editors that they can only put the template at the beginning of a bulleted list item (in the li tag case) or at the beginning of a paragraph (in the p tag case).
*:::: Probably in other cases {{temp|senseid}} needs to generate yet other tags (like div), but this will do for now. See also the [[User:Erutuon/lists/bad senseid|list]] of potentially badly placed {{temp|senseid}}s. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 03:26, 19 October 2020 (UTC)
*:::: I went and implemented this by adding {{para|tag}} to {{temp|senseid}} to specify a tag different from li, and fixed the badly placed {{temp|senseid}}s from the list above. So the idea is that in definition lines we will leave the parameter empty to use the li tag and in etymologies we will use {{para|tag|p}} for the p tag. This was a spur--of-the-moment decision so please let me know if there are problems with this solution. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 04:00, 19 October 2020 (UTC)

== Use semicolons in head template when parameters contain commas ==

On pages like [[{{l|en|we}}]] the {{<nowiki/>head}} template includes commas in its description fields, which affects readability.

== How do interwiki-links decide whether a given page is a match? Is that logic adjustable? ==

Back when we handled interwiki-links ourselves, they always pointed to a page with ''exactly'' the same title on the other Wiktionary. When flexibility was needed, we handled it with redirects; so, for example, [[[[don't|don'''&#x27;'''t]]]] (with a straight apostrophe) had an interwiki-link to [[[[:fr:don‚Äôt|fr:don'''&#x27;'''t]]]] (ditto), which was (and is) a redirect to [[[[:fr:don‚Äôt|fr:don'''‚Äô'''t]]]] (with a curly apostrophe), and [[[[:fr:don‚Äôt|fr:don'''‚Äô'''t]]]] (curly) had an interwiki-link to [[[[don‚Äôt|don'''‚Äô'''t]]]] (curly), which was (and is) a redirect to [[[[don‚Äôt|don'''&#x27;'''t]]]] (straight).

But it seems that the automatic interwiki-link feature doesn't seem to work that way. It adds interwiki-links directly from [[[[don't|don'''&#x27;'''t]]]] (straight) to [[[[:fr:don‚Äôt|fr:don'''‚Äô'''t]]]] (curly) and back, rejecting and bypassing any redirects.

This is a problem for cases where it doesn't recognize that two pages are the same. For example, [[[[:he:◊†◊ì◊ú◊¥◊ü]]]] (with a special ''gershayim'' character) is a redirect to [[[[:he:◊†◊ì◊ú"◊ü]]]] (with ASCII double-quotes), and [[[[◊†◊ì◊ú"◊ü]]]] (ASCII) is a redirect to [[[[◊†◊ì◊ú◊¥◊ü]]]] (''gershayim''); so in the old system, readers at either Wiktionary would see an interwiki-link to the other, but in the new system, they do not.

Does anyone know how we go about getting this changed?

== Mongolian conjugation ==

: ''Copied from [[Wiktionary:Feedback]].''

Someone please make [[Template:mn-conj]]!

This should be pretty easy actually, since Mongolian verbs don't inflect for tense and number (unlike Romance languages like Spanish, or even English). 

Here are *all* the suffixes you will need. Pretty short list, isn't it? 

* Simple Present Tense -–Ω–∞/–Ω–æ/–Ω—ç/–Ω”© (na/no/ne/n√∂)
* Past Tense -—Å–∞–Ω/—Å–æ–Ω/—Å—ç–Ω/—Å”©–Ω (san/son/sen/s√∂n)
* Informed Past Tense (any point in past) -–≤ (v)
* Informed Past Tense (not long ago) -–ª–∞–∞/–ª–æ–æ/–ª—ç—ç/–ª”©”© (laa/loo/lee/l√∂√∂)
* Non-Informed Past Tense (generally a slightly to relatively more distant past) -–∂—ç—ç/—á—ç—ç (jee/chee)
* Present Perfect Tense -–¥–∞–≥/–¥–æ–≥/–¥—ç–≥/–¥”©–≥ (dag/dog/deg/d√∂g)
* Present Progressive Tense -–∂/—á –±–∞–π–Ω–∞ (j/ch baina)
* (Reflective) Present Progressive Tense -–∞–∞/–æ–æ/—ç—ç/”©”© (aa/oo/ee/√∂√∂)
* Simple Future -—Ö (+–±–æ–ª–Ω–æ) (kh (+bolno))
* Infinitive Tense -—Ö (kh)
* Negative suffix (one of *many* ways to negate verbs) -–≥“Ø–π (g√ºi)

What do you think? [[Special:Contributions/72.76.95.136|72.76.95.136]] 19:10, 21 October 2020 (UTC)

: A few questions:
:* Re: "Mongolian verbs don't inflect for tense and number": Did you mean to write "person and number"? Because otherwise this seems to be contradicted by your list, which shows endings for different tenses.
:* Many of your list-items show multiple endings. How would the template know which ending to use for a given word?
:* Are there any irregular verbs?
:* Are there any verbs that don't have all of these forms?
:* Are there standard English names for these forms? If so, what are they?
:* Are there any spelling changes besides adding the ending? (Consider English ''hope'' ~ ''hoping'', ''hop'' ~ ''hopping'', ''lie'' ~ ''lying'': the ''-ing'' forms are perfectly regular in speech, but in writing there are some extra changes to appease the rules of English spelling.)

== Ways to make [[Template:en-verb]] smarter ==

[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2020/September#Propose_making_Template%3Aen-noun_pluralization_algorithm_smarter|Recently]], [[User:Benwing]] did a great job making [[Template:en-noun]] smarter. I wonder if someone could make [[Template:en-verb]] smarter. For example, at present writing <kbd>{{tl|en-verb}}</kbd> with no parameters on an ''-ize'' verb generates the (wrong) forms ''foobarizeing, foobarizeed''; for correct display, one has to specify <kbd>{{tl|en-verb|foobariz}}</kbd> on every single ''-ize'' verb. This seems unnecessary, because are there any verbs that end in ''ize'' where the ''e'' is not suppressed when forming those inflected forms? (Are there enough that they should be the default, at present, as opposed to the exception?) [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 04:44, 28 October 2020 (UTC)
:It's not just ''-ize''; there can't be many verbs at all whose lemma form ends in ''e'' where that ''e'' doesn't drop before ''-ed'' and ''-ing''. I can only think of a handful, like ''saute - sauteed - sauteing'' and ''dye - dyed - dyeing'' (where the ''e'' does drop before ''-ed'' but not before ''-ing'').

::::::::: Of course, we would want to decide first whether to make them live links- or to even have them at all.

:::::::::: {{re|Chuck Entz}} Interestingly, I thought this morning about the same issue. My solution was to use <code>*</code> to indicate that the first word inflects rather than the whole expression. This is maybe a bit more obscure but has the advantage that you don't have to repeat the page title, and it's almost always the first word that inflects. I thought also about something similar to your suggestion esp. for strong verbs, e.g. something like {{temp|en-verb|see<sees,seeing,saw,seen> the forest for the trees}}.

== [[droits-de-l'hommisme]] / [[droits-de-l'hommiste]] ==

"hommisme" and "hommiste" aren't words, so I think we should unlink them, i.e. blacken them and not have them point to entries ({{m|fr|hommisme}}, {{m|fr|hommiste}}) that shouldn't be created. 

The usual way of doing this would be to use the <code><nowiki>|head=</nowiki></code> parameter, and strip those strings of brackets. For an example of that, see {{m|fr|langue de Shakespeare}}, where I've used <code><nowiki>head=[[langue]] [[de]] Shakespeare</nowiki></code>. However, here, <code><nowiki>head=[[droits]]-[[de]]-[[l']]hommisme</nowiki></code> doesn't quite work. 

The thing is that when a string is located immediately next to brackets in the markup, that string is "absorbed" in the brackets, which means it appears as blue in the output. For example, <code><nowiki>[[action]]s</nowiki></code> is the equivalent of <code><nowiki>[[action|actions]]</nowiki></code>: [[action]]s. 

This behaviour is normally useful, as it saves you some typing. But in the present case, it's undesirable: writing <code><nowiki>[[l']]hommisme</nowiki></code> yields [[l'|l'hommisme]], with a link pointing to [[l']], which is confusing. So, is there a way to circumvent it?

: An empty <code>&lt;nowiki/&gt;</code> does the trick, but maybe there are better solutions. Maybe it should be fixed on the template level? ‚Äì [[User:Jberkel|Jberkel]] 00:10, 31 October 2020 (UTC)

== Thinking about "easy pronunciations" again ==

Some years ago (I haven't tried to dig it up) the Wikimedia Foundation threw money at interns to make an easy pronunciation recording system we could use. This didn't happen; the project failed I suppose. I also had a brief period where I did pronunciations myself, mostly going through computing terms (and it always tickles me to find those rare old entries and hear my dulcet tones). At that time I had a tedious process that was ''only partly'' facilitated by some kind of media upload process (I remember it had a sort of USSR red flag icon, was it called Communist, Commonist?).
<br> That was probably about a decade ago. Isn't it reasonable to think about this again? I know the problems (it's very hard to spot vandalism in voice files since there are no text "diffs"; it's easy for people to produce low-quality, hissy, white-noisy files; etc. etc.) but you know, I'm a human being, I am a native BrE speaker, if we had the convenient tech to slice the files and upload them then I could record probably a thousand words in a day, easy. Even if I had to manually remove white noise, since I have got some music studio software tools to do this.
<br> And meanwhile low-quality spam shit like "EmmaSaying" on YouTube is running circles around us (and sometimes having outright incorrect pronunciations, which doesn't matter because they still get Google visitors and ad hits). What can we do? [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 10:36, 31 October 2020 (UTC)

::{{ping|Equinox|Mahagaja}} The only missing thing here really is the software to make it easy to slice up an audio file into separate per-word audio files. Given a set of per-word audio files, I can easily write a bot job to upload them all to the appropriate pages, and I bet with some help from [[User:Erutuon]] we could rig something up in Javascript so that you could do this yourself. However, I have no experience working with audio files, so I don't know how to write the slicing code. But I'd be surprised if something of this sort doesn't already exist ...

::: {{reply to|Benwing2}} Yeah if we can't slice and dice the audio then we can't do anything. But you are happy with the upload, let's get a little Wiktionary team together who can do all the parts. I'm good at YELLING UNTIL STUFF GETS DONE. Thank you for listening. (BTW it is important to do noise reduction. I can do that here 'cause I have got the tools. I suppose the downside of this could be making it ''too'' easy so that every random stranger can hiss some white noise into the microphone. Anyway, this is a real tech problem we should address, and thanks for listening.) [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 17:25, 31 October 2020 (UTC)

::::Why don't you use your smartphones? The voice recorder app works fine. You can use your earphones, edit the file right there on the cellphone, and then convert it to OGA afterwards through some online converter. It doesn't seem terribly inconvenient.

* Thanks for the constructive criticism as always, Equinox. One recommendation is to use LinguaLibre - even Wonderfool has churned out around [[c:Category:Lingua Libre pronunciation by Vealhurl|4000 audio entries]], probably [[c:Category:Lingua Libre pronunciation by I learned some phrases|5000]] if you count all their sockpuppets.

== [[:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/bazov—ä#rfd-notice--|Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/bazov—ä]] ==

This page was created on the basis of [http://essja.narod.ru/pg/01/f170-171.htm an entry] in the ''Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Languages'', which in turn was created to be the etymology of Lower Sorbian {{m|dsb|bazowy||pertaining to elder trees}}. Perhaps the authors of that dictionary are unaware that Proto-Slavic ''—ä'' can sometimes surface as ''a'' in Lower Sorbian, but it can, and the etymon of the word is actually {{m|sla-pro|*b—äzov—ä}}, which also has [http://essja.narod.ru/pg/03/f144-145.htm an entry] in the same dictionary. Alternatively, {{m|dsb|bazowy}} may simply have been coined in Lower Sorbian as {{m|dsb|baz}} + {{m|dsb|-owy}}, but either way, it isn't from *''bazov—ä''. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 15:21, 28 January 2015 (UTC)

Proposal: '''Delete''' {{temp|l/pt}}, {{temp|l/en}} and the others like those, or delete as many as possible if for some reason some of those should be kept. Full list is collapsed above this message. I did not take the trouble to tag all of those {{temp|rfd}}, only German and Latin are tagged.

Rationale: Use | rather than /, that is, {{temp|l|pt}} rather than {{temp|l/pt}}. This assumes it does the same thing and that we don't need anymore {{temp|l/pt}} or {{temp|l/en}} or others to consume less resources on the server like we apparently needed pre-Lua or in case they do something that {{temp|l}} can't or some other reason.

Current RFDO discussions:
* [[#Template:l/de]]
* [[#Template:l/la]]

Older discussion:
* [[Template talk:l/en]]

It's worth noting that in the current RFDO discussions some of these templates seem to be treated like obvious crap to be deleted by some people. Quoting {{user|Renard Migrant}} from the l/de discussion: "Somewhat hilariously, a lot of these templates call {{temp|l}} directly (see {{temp|l/ty}} for a specific example). So they now do the very thing they were created to avoid. Even worse, because they call l but don't allow all its parameters, so they're literally worse than useless." --[[User:Daniel Carrero|Daniel]] 01:55, 5 June 2015 (UTC)

Okay, so I'm doing this [[in lieu of]] [[User:Embryomystic]]. He may have gotten tired or something, or didn't check his [[User talk:Embryomystic|talk page]] yet. He stopped editing today about 15 minutes after I messaged him about this.

Please forgive me, I'm not trying to be mean, just being honest with you, but it pains me to see a user removing a template that I've been using for quite some time and changing it to another with all the pages he/she can find. The user is an experienced user, so I understand he/she may have a valuable reason for this. However, I think before a user starts doing this, they should bring it up here or somewhere similar first, which is what I'm doing now.

Embryomystic seems to have some reason why he/she doesn't like the neuter of and neuter singular of templates, and is replacing them with [[Template:inflection of]], along with the parameters n and s. Although I don't agree that [[Template:neuter singular of]] should be deleted, I am going to bring it up here so that this can get resolved and so that, if the community decides the template should be deleted, then we can run a bot through and have it change all the templates for us (or whatever other consensus decision we come up with) rather than having one user do it all manually. [[User:Philmonte101|Philmonte101]] ([[User talk:Philmonte101|talk]]) 09:40, 3 August 2016 (UTC)
: '''Keep'''. I personally disagree that [[Template:neuter singular of]] should be deleted, since it seems to be literally no different at all from what [[Template:inflection of]] does. I feel like a lot of people here care a whole lot about the ''inner code'' formatting of entries, such as which template which does exactly the same thing should we use?, and will change it even when there's an intricate detail that they don't like. Personally, I never felt this way. The formatting is of very minor importance to me. It is of course important to some degree, as you don't want a bogged together entry with no spacing, even though it looks exactly the same on the outside as it would if there were spaces. But I'm just more focused on what's on the ''outside'', what people who come here to read the dictionary to get linguistic knowledge, come to see. Most regular everyday lurkers probably could care less which template is being used, and honestly probably wouldn't even understand wiki templates at all.

: However, that's not my only reason that I want to keep this. Another is that [[Template:neuter of]] and [[Template:neuter singular of]] are easier for people to use than [[Template:inflection of]]. I see ''inflection of'' as a template to be used for inflections of verbs or nouns that have to be explained in many words. That's where it gets convenient; so users don't have to type all of that out, so it makes it shorter. But in this case, it actually makes it longer. People actually have to type out "inflection of|n|s|[...]". This also implies that ''newcomers'' will have to have the same template knowledge as users who've been here 7 years like Embryo, and when they try entering <nowiki>{{neuter of|[...]|lang=da}}</nowiki>, then they will be disappointed that it isn't so simple. Sure, I have no problem with people using "inflection of" when they ''create'' neuter inflection entries, since that just seems like a personal preference thing, and like I said I care about the formatting of the code to some degree, but it's not all that important, especially not as important as some here make it out to be. After all, the three templates all do exactly the same thing, so it makes no difference. [[User:Philmonte101|Philmonte101]] ([[User talk:Philmonte101|talk]]) 09:40, 3 August 2016 (UTC)

== Various ergative-related pages for English ==

===[[:Appendix:English ergative verbs]], [[:Category:English ergative verbs]] - confusion with ambitransitive verbs (verbs that have both transitive and intransitive senses)===
The explanation in the appendix of what an "English ergative verb" is doesn't jive with other explanations of ergativity, such as at '''[[w:Ergative‚Äìabsolutive language]]'''.  In the sentence, ''‚ÄúThe boat sank,‚Äù'' the boat is definitely not the <samp>PATIENT</samp> as the example at '''[[:Appendix:English ergative verbs]]''' currently indicates -- it is instead the agent or actor doing the sinking, and ''sank'' in this instance is just a plain old intransitive verb.  In the sentence, ''‚ÄúThis book reads well,‚Äù'' or in ''‚ÄúThese eggs eat well,‚Äù'' the book or the eggs are clearly not the actors -- semantically, they can't be, outside of very strange and possibly drug-induced circumstances.  This is the closest to an actual ergative construction in English, where a semantic object is used in the syntactic subject position (and, when using pronouns that make case explicit like ''he - him'' or ''she - her'', the pronoun would be in the nominative case).  This matches the definition we currently give in our entry at {{m|en|ergative}}.  This also appears to match what is described in the '''[[w:Ergative‚Äìabsolutive language]]''' article, where the semantic object is treated grammatically with the same case and syntax as a subject.  This is notably different from the content of the flawed and unsourced '''[[w:Ergative verb]]''' article, which appears to be rehashing a description of patientive ambitransitive verbs that is presented more clearly and with citations at '''[[w:Ambitransitive verb#Patientive]]'''.

Moreover, although ergative constructions would seem to exist in English, ''‚Äúergative‚Äù'' as a label is just not very useful in describing English verbs: although generally only useful for describing the qualities of how the noun verbs, as in the examples above with books and eggs, basically any semantically transitive verb can be used in an ergative construction just by putting the object of the verb's action into the subject slot in the syntax of the sentence.  Ergativity is not a feature of English verbs, so much as English syntax.

As such, I propose that we delete both '''[[:Appendix:English ergative verbs]]''' and '''[[:Category:English ergative verbs]]'''.  We should probably also delete '''[[:Category:Old English ergative verbs]]''' as well.  

Looking at some of the other ergative categories, like '''[[:Category:Low_German_ergative_verbs]]''' or '''[[:Category:Mandarin ergative verbs]]''', I find that they mostly have descriptions like ''‚Äú<samp>[LANGUAGE]</samp> intransitive verbs that become causatives when used transitively.‚Äù''  This does not agree with the sense of {{m|en|ergative}} that I'm familiar with, nor does it even always agree with the entries so labeled, giving me serious doubts about the validity of these categories.  However, I will leave that to the respective editing communities.  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 23:51, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
:Gee, I thought the problem with the ergative label was just that normal users don't understand the word. Apparently some contributors who add the label to definitions don't either. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  01:25, 1 December 2016 (UTC)
: '''Keep'''. Ergative verbs are a useful category, and can't simply be replaced by "transitive and intransitive" because they're not the same. Ergative verbs are passive or middle voice when used intransitively, but when used transitively the meaning flips to that of a causative, to make the object undergo the intransitive sense. For example, "the boat sinks" is intransitive and does not have a clear agent. But when you say "the storm sinks the boat", then the storm is acting as an agent on the boat. In Dutch, the intransitive use has a passive/stative perfect construction too, whereas the transitive use has an active construction. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:33, 1 December 2016 (UTC)
:* I'm fine with ''ergative'' as a label for other languages, provided those editors have a use for it.
:: My primary concerns are that 1) I don't see this as a useful label for English, and 2) this use of ''ergative'' to refer to a special kind of intransitive-and-causative verb usage does not agree with either our definitions at {{m|en|ergative}}, or the way the term is employed in other linguistic contexts (viz. the '''[[w:Ergative‚Äìabsolutive language]]''' article).  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 21:53, 1 December 2016 (UTC)
::: I think the single definition at {{m|en|ergative}} is meant to encompass both the ergative case and the ergative verb, though it is really not very clear.

*I always thought that ergative verbs (in English) were as defined [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/ergative here] and [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ergative here], which, as far as I have observed, is how the label is used (or intended to be used) at Wiktionary. Therefore, I don't see a problem, unless the label is seen as too technical for readers. I don't understand the comment above that "any semantically transitive verb can be used in an ergative construction just by putting the object of the verb's action into the subject slot in the syntax of the sentence".

:: {{reply to|Mihia}} -- The definitions you linked to provide senses that are indistinguishable from the more widely used descriptor, {{m|en|ambitransitive}}, or simply by stating that a given verb is both transitive and intransitive.  For this sense, using the term {{m|en|ergative}} instead only invites confusion.  As described by others at [[[[:w:Talk:Ergative_verb#Not_standard_usage_in_linguistics]]]], this usage of {{m|en|ergative}} appears to have arisen out of confusion, and usage of this sense also appears to be limited to a narrow subset of fields that use the term (perhaps just ESL?).  In light of these issues, I see no usefulness and too much potential for user confusion were we to use {{m|en|ergative}} as a label for any and all English verbs that are both transitive and intransitive, such as {{m|en|boil}} in ''‚Äúhe '''boils''' the water‚Äù'' and ''‚Äúthe water '''boils'''‚Äù''.
:: Cases where {{m|en|ergative}} actually starts to make sense for English outside of the confused {{m|en|ambitransitive}} sense are cases where the verb itself is semantically transitive, and is used in an intransitive grammatical construction where the grammatical subject of the verb is also the semantic patient of the action, and the semantic agent is left unstated.  Restating from a separate thread, over at [[[[User_talk:Eirikr#Discussion_of_ergatives_and_perfect_tense_in_Germanic]]]]:
<blockquote style="border:1px solid gray; padding:4px;"><code>&lt;...snip...&gt;</code>
: ... words like {{m|en|melt}} and {{m|en|sink}} and {{m|en|grow}} '''cannot''' usefully or correctly be described as ergative.  For a sentence like ''"the boat ''{{m|en|sinks}}, there is no ... agent that is making this happen.  The action in question "happens by itself".  These words are fundamentally [semantically] intransitive, where the modern EN transitive uses have developed from a causative sense.
: This is not to say that separate causative and passive constructions could not also exist.  Compare:
:* The ice melts.  -- ''intransitive''
:* The ice is being melted by her.  -- ''passive''
:* She melts the ice.  -- ''transitive''
:* She makes the ice melt.  -- ''causative''
: Semantically, in the kinds of environments that humans have historically found themselves, actions like {{m|en|melt|melting}} and {{m|en|freeze|freezing}} are precisely the kinds of actions that "happen by themselves".  There doesn't ''need'' to be any actor causing the action of {{m|en|melt|"melting"}} to happen.  Similarly for {{m|en|freeze}}, {{m|en|sink}}, {{m|en|grow}}, etc.
: Meanwhile, the description of "ergative" could apply quite well to verbs that are semantically inherently transitive, such as {{m|en|cook}}.  {{m|en|cook|"Cooking"}} is not something that naturally happens by itself in the kinds of environments that humans have historically found themselves; this action requires an agent, an actor.  This could be something inanimate, such as "heat", but the verb semantically requires someone or something to carry out the action.  Note that ''there is no similar causative for such verbs'', precisely because there is no semantically intransitive sense.  When used causatively, the implication is that A causes B to do something transitively to C.
:* He cooks the eggs.  -- ''transitive''
:* *He makes the eggs cook.  -- ''unnatural, incorrect causative''
:* He makes him cook the eggs.  -- ''causative, still transitive''
:* The eggs are being cooked by him.  -- ''passive''
:* '''The eggs cook.''' -- '''''ergative'''''
: This last instance is where the "ergative" label finally makes sense, as I've understood your [CodeCat's] description and the description in the WP article [at [[:w:Ergative_verb]]].  This could also be analyzed as a kind of passive construction where the actor carrying out the transitive action is left unstated.</blockquote>
:: However, this kind of ergative usage is mostly a matter of English syntax, which would further limit the usefulness of this term as a label.  [[User:Per utramque cavernam|Per utramque cavernam]] had a good breakdown regarding transitivity, intransitivity, and ergativity in an English verb context over at [[[[User_talk:DCDuring#parse]]]].

*I object to the label, as it is not part of any US education other than some formal education in FLs and linguistics. If we had different labels for users of different preferences, I'd be down with "ergative" as a label, as long as it was not the default.

** If {{m|sla-pro|*mysljati}} has no direct descendants, then we have to ask where the derived verbs that have it as a base came from. Could these derived verbs themselves be of Proto-Slavic origin?

Approaching- not identical. Where to draw the line is a matter of some debate. In this case, though, our practice is clear: there's no point in a dictionary providing a reconstruction that's not connected to attested words. That's not OR, that's editorial discretion.

We clearly cannot follow the sources here, as they contradict each other. This is an issue with a lot of your editing, Victar. You blindly go with sources which often posit very bold hypotheses that don't have widespread acceptance, you don't critically examine them. You also do not seek out consensus; whenever someone reverts your questionable additions, you ignore the fact that reverting an addition means no consensus, and repeatedly reinstate. When discussions finally start, you also refuse to wait for a consensus, but reinstate your edits as soon as you think you have proven your point, as on [[Reconstruction talk:Proto-Indo-European/·∏±lit√≥s]].

:::::::: No person is correct in all decisions. CodeCat has made mistakes, as have I. Recently, Victar, you're been running roughshod across these entries, frequently ignoring language specific-considerations in favor of utopian reconstructionism. I've tried to be fairly conservative in the way I've edited on here, and CodeCat is very useful in reining in my reconstructive excesses. Similarly, sometimes she has personal opinions which need curtailing, but this is done in discussion with other editors. If there is no consensus, it is better to not add it all then to add highly speculative material. Again, I've made these mistakes many times, and indeed at one point CodeCat told me to go read a bunch of literature since I was adding so many bad reconstructions.
:::::::: In this matter, I would agree with CodeCat that there seem to be several competing explanations or maybe several competing ''forms''.

::::::::: I am completely open to being wrong and ''absolutely crave'' discussions so that I might learn from them. I do ping you and CodeCat on entries that I hope either of you can look over. I probably would have done the same once I finished working on the entries, [[Reconstruction talk:Proto-Indo-European/h‚ÇÇer«µ-|like I did here]].
::::::::: My objection is in CodeCat's method of simply reverting someone with no explanation other than "you're wrong", if that much, which I find in bad form. We should be encouraging editors to go through the sources and add this information to the project, and, in turn, correcting mistakes, not disregarding them with reverts and throwing the baby out with the bath water.
::::::::: You both know, I'm a clean and methodical sourcer (I added {{para|passage}} to many reference templates to improve them further), and I want to get these entries done by the books as much as anyone else. Three sources, Kroonen, de Van, and Beekes all suggest a nasal verb root, but if that's too speculative, lets have a conversation and come to some less speculative alternatives. I'm happy to see that CodeCat has now added some to the root entry, but this was only after my objections to the deletion of the entry. --[[User:Victar|Victar]] ([[User talk:Victar|talk]]) 18:27, 31 July 2017 (UTC)
:::::::::: I usually err on the side of caution, and I wouldn't even have created a PIE page in this instance. The descendants are too different to really pin them down onto a single form. Kroonen etc. may be right about the original ''-neh‚ÇÇ-'' suffix, but this is very speculative considering that it doesn't appear in that form in any language. It appears to me like they pulled it out of thin air. The nasal itself is plentifully attested, but its exact nature is too unclear. What I find especially telling is that Greek added an additional ''-ye-'' present suffix to it, as if it wasn't "present enough" in its old form. The Germanic form, with a stative formed, seemingly, from a characterised present, is even more puzzling. So my preferred option would be to just say "We don't know" and only list the forms without trying to pin a particular underlying formation on them, as Kroonen and De Vaan do. Note that Kroonen and De Vaan disagree on what they think the original form was, and I find neither of their proposals particularly compelling. De Vaan's proposal might work if the root had an additional final laryngeal, but that's ad hoc and only solves the puzzle for Latin, it makes it harder for all the others. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 18:37, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

I think it better to reference the thesaurus without a template, using a short phrase like "See also [[Thesaurus:cat]]". This template produces e.g. "(marijuana): For semantic relationships of this sense, see marijuana in the Thesaurus" when placed to Synonyms section, which to my taste is too wordy, and does not fit nicely as a last item in a synonym list on a bullet, e.g. "puss, pussy, malkin, kitty, pussy-cat, grimalkin; see also [[Thesaurus:cat]]" or even "puss, pussy, malkin, kitty, pussy-cat, grimalkin; see also [[Thes:cat]]" if Thes ever becomes a namespace redirect.

The problem here is that such formations are productive in modern Russian: pretty much any noun or adjective can be made into a prefix by adding {{m|ru|-–æ-}} onto the end of the stem (or {{m|ru|-–µ-}} if the end of the stem is palatal). Otherwise we're going to end up with an indefinitely expanding set of such prefixes, cf. {{m|ru||–º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ-|machine-}} in {{m|ru|–º–∞—à–∏ÃÅ–Ω–Ω–æ-—á–∏—Ç–∞ÃÅ–µ–º—ã–π||[[machine-readable]]}}, {{m|ru||–±–æ–º–±–æ-|bomb-}} in {{m|ru|–±–æ–º–±–æ—É–±–µÃÅ–∂–∏—â–µ||[[bomb shelter]]}}, etc. The case of {{m|ru|—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω–æ-}} is a bit special as the corresponding lemma is {{m|ru|—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω–∏ÃÅ–Ω}}, but the stem of that lemma is actually {{m|ru||—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω-}} as evidenced by plural forms such as {{m|ru|—Å–ª–∞–≤—èÃÅ–Ω–µ}} (nominative plural), {{m|ru|—Å–ª–∞–≤—èÃÅ–Ω}} (genitive plural), etc. where the {{m|ru||-–∏–Ω}} singular suffix drops out.

If we do it the former way, the connection to {{m|ru|–≤–æ–¥–∞ÃÅ}} is made clearer, and the word is automatically categorized into [[:CAT:Russian compound words]], which appears correct to me.

-o- and -e- are not interfixes in Russian.

If the syllable ends in a consonant, the preceding consonant is not necessarily required: {{m|ru|—Å—Ç–æ–ª}} does rhyme with {{m|ru|—É–∫–æÃÅ–ª}} (the rhyme is -√≥l; it's officially considered a "poor rhyme" (–±–µ–¥–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∏—Ñ–º–∞), but is nevertheless very widely used in poetry).

==[[:Category:Proto-Nguni language]]==
I believe that this category should be deleted for a few reasons.

1. All reconstructions are unsourced. The only source I have found about Proto-Nguni is a book called ''Comparative Reconstruction of Proto-Nguni Phonology'' by Sambulo Ndlovu. However, in my opinion it is rather poorly done, making basic mistakes such as assuming Zulu <nhl> and Xhosa <ntl> represent sounds, when it is just an orthographical difference.

2. It is difficult to tell which words/features existed in Proto-Nguni, and which words/features spread among the Nguni languages at a later date. For example, the Zulu/Xhosa/Swati cognates iqaqa/iqaqa/licaca "polecat". This word was borrowed from a Khoisan language, but was it loaned into Proto-Nguni, or was it loaned across various Nguni languages?

3. The differences between Proto-Nguni and the modern Nguni languages are very minor. There are only a few systematic differences. Most differences are sporadic. A few systematic changes: Zulu: t É ∞ >  É; Swati: z > t, t ∞ > ts/tf, d > dz/dv.

<s>4. The current reconstructions on Wiktionary are not parsimonious. From Proto-Bantu to modern Nguni, there was a change CVÃÅCV > CVÃÅCVÃÅ > CVÃÇCV. The reconstructions on Wiktionary have this as CVÃÅCVÃÅ. However, there is no evidence that this was the form in Proto-Nguni, because no modern Nguni languages preserve that. It would be more parsimonious to say that Proto-Nguni already had CVÃÇCV, same as the modern Nguni languages.</s> Actually, disregard this. I just found out Phuthi preserves CVÃÅCVÃÅ.

5. Problems with the reconstruction arise when considering the Lala language. There was a sound change of labial palatalization (in which labials were palatalized in contact with /w/), which affected Nguni languages, Sotho-Tswana languages, and I believe some other Southern Bantu languages. However, the Lala language is the only Nguni language to not undergo labial palatalization. This would imply that Proto-Nguni did not have labial palatalization, so that a form such as *inja "dog" should be reconstructed as *imbwa (which is the form in Lala).

:Thank you for bringing this to the community's attention. I'd like to address the points you made in order:
:1. All our Proto-Nguni entries are by {{ping|Rua}}, who IIRC believes that reconstructions need not be sourced so long as the individual sound changes at work can be sourced. I hope that Rua will contribute to this discussion further. For my own part, I had seen that book by Ndlovu online, and tried (and failed) to get my hands on a copy of it, but I am disappointed to hear that it isn't up to snuff.
:2. This is a persistent problem in Bantu historical linguistics, and it's really the same for Proto-Bantu itself. BLR tries to avoid making a claim that their entries are in fact reconstructible to PB, because those with limited geographic distribution could equally well be innovations whose form was modified to make them seem like inheritances.
:3. Minor differences are not of themselves a reason to avoid reconstructing a language, but I think you could argue that Proto-Bantu and Proto-Khoe entries can house all the information we need to present, and I would be amenable to that.
:5. Lala is a very curious language, and I don't know of any consensus on it. The traditional Zunda-Tekela split would then mean that Tekela is paraphyletic if Lala is indeed preserving the original condition. I don't know why it couldn't be a contact language, however, in a similar manner to Phuthi, which was modified by contact with Sotho. Ownby views Lala as the basalmost Nguni language, producing very different reconstructions, but also employs suspect glottochronology.
:Anyway, I've not studied Nguni as you have, but I am concerned by reconstructions unrestrained by complicated reality. ‚Äî[[User:Metaknowledge|ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨knowledge]]<small><sup>''[[User talk:Metaknowledge|discuss]]/[[Special:Contributions/Metaknowledge|deeds]]''</sup></small> 20:37, 10 March 2019 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Latin words interfixed with -i-#rfd-notice--|Category:Latin words interfixed with -i-]] ==

This isn't actually an interfix, but it's just the form that the thematic vowel of the preceding noun takes in a compound. ''i'' is the regular outcome of various Old Latin vowels in most positions. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 22:22, 8 March 2019 (UTC)
:There actually are a few arguments for -i- being an interfix in Latin compound words. The many examples of words with short a e o u in non-final open syllables clearly show that weakening of short vowels to -i- was not a regular phonological process in Classical Latin. And it seems unlikely that Classical Latin had a productive morphophonological rule of vowel reduction to -i- either:  in "[https://www.academia.edu/533503/Latin_vowel_reduction_and_the_reality_of_phonological_rules Latin vowel reduction and the reality of phonological rules]", Tore Janson says that Latin adjective and verb roots with short -o- never have alternative forms with -i- in compound words (e.g. ''potens'' forms ''impotens'', not *''impitens'') (p. 5). Also, Old Latin vowel reduction didn't result in -i- in closed syllables or before r, and usually not before clusters of an obstruent and r, but linking -i- can be found in these contexts (compare lect'''i'''sternium, quadr'''i'''remis, herb'''i'''gradus to inc'''e'''stus, on'''e'''ro, perp'''e'''tro). In compounds, -i- was used even after consonant stems (such as drac≈çn- in the category's list of words).--[[User:Urszag|Urszag]] ([[User talk:Urszag|talk]]) 01:19, 20 October 2019 (UTC)

:I'd be interested to know how many 21st century entry-level grammars and ESL/EFL texts ''use'' ''participle'', rather than merely mention the term and put it in a glossary.
:The term ''participle'' gives short shrift to gerund use of the term formed by adding "ing" to the base form of the verb. Any -ing form can be used as adjective, uncountable noun, and a component of progressive/continuous aspect of verbs. (I don't think it is always possible to use an ing-form as a countable noun, eg, ?''cookings'', ?''freezings'', ?''snowings'', ?''drivings'', though such use may just be rare for some verbs.) ''CGEL'' argues forcefully that there is little to distinguish participle/adjectives and gerund/nouns, not only in form, but also in syntactic properties. (The argument is in the chapter "Non-finite and verbless clauses" ¬ß4.3. ''CGEL'' refers to the form as ''gerund-participle'', which has the advantage of preserving the connection with the classically derived terms, but presupposes knowledge of those terms.

== Swedish inflectional templates ==

{{ping|Patrik Stridvall|Vildricianus|Mike|Rua|LA2}} There are 34 Swedish inflectional templates for different possible noun, verb, adjective and adverb forms. Most of them are equivalent to simple calls to {{temp|form of}} or {{temp|inflection of}}. None of them do any categorization except adding to [[:CAT:Swedish noun forms]], [[:CAT:Swedish verb forms]], [[:CAT:Swedish adjective forms]] and/or [[:CAT:Swedish adverb forms]], which is already handled by the headword template on the same page. (Exceptions: (1) {{temp|sv-verb-form-pastpart}}, which categorizes into [[:CAT:Swedish past participles]]; (2) the obsolete-form templates, see below.) The following is the full list:

* {{temp|sv-adj-form-abs-def}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-abs-def+pl}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-abs-def-m}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-abs-indef-n}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-abs-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-comp}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-comp-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-sup-attr}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-sup-attr-m}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-sup-pred}}
* {{temp|sv-adj-form-sup-pred-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-adv-form-comp}}
* {{temp|sv-adv-form-sup}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-adj}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-def}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-def-gen}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-def-gen-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-def-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-indef-gen}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-indef-gen-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-noun-form-indef-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-proper-noun-gen}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-imp}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-inf-pass}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-past}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-past-pass}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-pastpart}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-pre}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-pre-pass}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-prepart}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-pres-pass}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-subjunctive}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-sup}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-sup-pass}}

A slight complication is that a few of the templates have an extra parameter (usually {{para|plural of}}, in one case {{para|obsoleted by}}) for obsolete forms, which specifies the equivalent non-obsolete form. When this parameter is specified, the text changes to include the word "obsolete", and the category changes to [[:CAT:Swedish obsolete noun forms]] and/or [[:CAT:Swedish obsolete verb forms]]. This encompasses the following 5 templates:

* {{temp|sv-noun-form-def-pl}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-imp}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-past}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-past-pass}}
* {{temp|sv-verb-form-pre}}

Most other languages have a single template to handle all non-lemma forms, or at most one template per part of speech. I'd like to replace these templates with either (a) a single language-specific template, (b) calls to {{temp|form of}} and/or {{temp|inflection of}}, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b), depending on the template.

Note that 11 of the templates (not including any of the templates with obsolete-form support) are mentioned in [[Module:accel/sv]], which will have to be changed accordingly (not hard).

Note {{diff|42023154|40577394}}: an editor has entirely removed the English definitions, replacing them with an incomprehensible "abstract noun" definition.

(2) an act or instance of making or expressing (a remark, argument, etc) obliquely, evasively, or distortedly."'' So, just defining it as ''"abstract noun of {{th-l|‡∏ï‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏á}}"'' would be more appropriate. Moreover, there are terms that have no directly corresponding terms in English and there abstract noun definitions would need long and redundant descriptions. For example, the verb {{th-l|‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£}} is defined as ''"to lose control of oneself, lose one's mind, or go crazy because of shyness, excitement, surprise, etc."'', and its abstract noun forms are {{th-l|‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£}} and {{th-l|‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£}}, which would be defined as ''"the condition of losing control of oneself, lose one's mind, or go crazy because of shyness, excitement, surprise, etc."'' and ''"an act or instance of losing control of oneself, lose one's mind, or go crazy because of shyness, excitement, surprise, etc."'', respectively.

In Thai, an abstract noun is merely formed by placing "‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£" (for action) or "‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°" (for condition) before any verb, adverb, or adjective and just covers all the senses that the verb, adverb, or adjective has. There's no need to add something which the OP described as "real definitions". This is the same thing as defining "flied" as "a simple past tense of fly" instead of defining "fly" as "to move in the air" and defining "flied" as "moved in the air". The template is applicable to any languages of similar structures, including Asian languages like Khmer, Lao, etc. The fact that it is now used in Thai and has not yet been used in other languages doesn't constitute a reason for its deletion. So, '''keep''' it. --[[User:YURi|YURi]] ([[User talk:YURi|talk]]) 19:36, 17 April 2019 (UTC)

::::RE: Definitions/translations vs "abstract noun of". Which one?
:::::I probably need to think more about this, but my current view is that a simpler approach should be used primarily. I am not a fan of unnecessarily complex approaches. So, "abstract noun of" should be used mainly, and a definition/translation should be provided only if it is needed. Defining/translating words that are equivalent to -ing words (e.g., {{th-l|‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏π‡∏î}} and {{th-l|‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô}} = speaking and walking respectively) does not add much. So, definitions/translations should be provided only for (a smaller set of) words that really do need them (e.g., {{th-l|‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏£‡∏π‡πâ}} is defined in the Thai Wiktionary. Other words that should be defined/translated are {{th-l|‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ñ‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á}} and {{th-l|‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏£‡πà‡∏á}} etc.). These words, for those who do not speak Thai, have to be defined because they do not simply mean "the state of -ing (something)", or they may have specialized meanings. For example, {{th-l|‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏£‡∏π‡πâ}} does not simply mean "knowing," or "the state of being aware or informed." It means "knowledge," or "facts, information, and skills acquired by a person." It also has other meanings. Anyway, I am open to other views. If you have a strong argument for eliminating "abstract noun of," please share it.

Other than Thai, this template was generally tended to serve many languages such as Northern Thai, Isan, Lao, L√º, etc, as it was used in Thai Wiktionary. (Indeed, they have all same abstract noun concept.) At the present, we made more specific templates for each language like "th-abstract noun of", "lo-abstract noun of", etc. For English Wiktionary, I suggest that the template could be renamed in same way (because it is just currently used with Thai entries).

It is not limited to have the "abstract noun of" only one line. More senses can be added. For example, [[:th:‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏ß]] can have "abstract noun of" in meaning 1 and then scientific sense in meaning 2.

Additionally, use of template is beneficial for scripts and bots making more entries, as I do in Thai Wiktionary everyday. --[[User:Octahedron80|Octahedron80]] ([[User talk:Octahedron80|talk]]) 01:53, 18 April 2019 (UTC)

{{ping|Octahedron80|YURi|Miwako Sato}} The problem I have with these is that they are defined as lemmas. That means that they have the full status of independent word, and are not part of the inflection paradigm of another word. One expects lemmas to have proper definitions, and one would also expect to find lemmas in a typical dictionary with definitions given. If they were defined as non-lemmas, then it is understood that their meaning is tied to the meaning of the verb to which they belong, and that they generally are not given entries in the average dictionary but instead are grouped with the verb. A key in this question is also whether every verb has its own abstract noun. If there are many verbs that do not have abstract nouns, then they are better considered as lemmas as their existence is not predictable. They should have proper definitions then, rather than being labelled as "abstract noun". To say it another way, the treatment we give to them depends on whether we consider them a case of inflection or of derivation. Inflection is non-lemmas, derivation is lemmas. Inflection usually implies every verb has a fixed set of forms, while derivation is unpredictable and happens on a case-by-case basis.

If abstract nouns are inflectional, and thus non-lemmas and do not need a full definition, then it is still possible for them to have special senses. The same situation exists in English with participles and gerunds. On one side, they are verb forms, inflectional and thus non-lemmas, and their meaning is tied to that of the verb. But they can also sometimes "detach" from the verb and develop senses that are not shared with the verb. In these cases, the standard practice (that I have seen) has been to have Verb headings for the sense tied to the verb, and Noun or Adjective headings alongside it for senses that are separate from the verb. This practice could be applied to Thai too, then these abstract nouns could be defined simply as verb forms (non-lemma), with an additional Noun header (lemma) for cases where they have independent senses. Again, though, if abstract nouns are derivational, then they must have full definitions and should not use a template, as this is the standard for Wiktionary entries.

Separately from this, there is the question of whether abstract nouns need their own special template. We already have the {{temp|inflection of}} template, which can easily handle any kind of inflection, making a separate template unnecessary. I also wonder if an abstract noun is not really just a verbal noun, for which a separate discussion exists below. It would be cleaner if we could make Thai use the verbal noun template instead of having its own separate one. But using {{temp|inflection of}} would be even more preferable. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 21:46, 24 April 2019 (UTC)

:Abstract noun (‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏°) is a type of noun and is used in sentences as noun, equivalent to English -ing or -ness. It is the umbrella term for verbal noun, adjectival noun, and adverbial noun (other languages may have more kinds). Almost verbs/adjectives/adverbs could be fix with ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£/‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏° to make the abstract nouns, with some exceptions: (1) The rule can only be found in nowaday/modern use. Dated or obsolete words do not have it. (2) It seldom applies on peotic/galant terms or long idioms/proverbs. (3) Some terms actually never form the abstract noun. They might be considered as (sort of unpredictable) non-lemmas because they are likety not given in published dictionaries, but they should not also have misrepresenting header tag, they must have ''noun'' instead of ''verb/adjective/adverb'' that would become incorrect part of speech. (I also speak upto other languages in the region that have same concept.)

:I see <nowiki>{{gerund of|walk|lang=en}}</nowiki> in [[walking]] as lemma under noun tag, that is really equivalent to the ''abstract noun of'' in [[‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô]]. Why the ''gerund of'' can exist while the ''abstract noun of'' cannot?

Instead, a full definition and etymology is provided since they are considered lemmas of their own. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 21:31, 1 April 2019 (UTC)
:Not all languages work like English. Several languages have forms conventionally called "verbal nouns". Arabic is an example; every verb has one or more associated verbal nouns, which function somewhat as infinitives (Arabic has no infinitives as such). These verbal nouns are listed in dictionaries next to the verb, because you need them in many syntactic constructions. I'm really not sure what you would replace them with if you removed this template. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 07:05, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
:: Arabic rarely uses this template (see the census below), so it must use {{temp|ar-verbal noun of}} almost exclusively. {{temp|ar-verbal noun of}} has the {{para|form}} parameter, which makes it harder to convert to {{temp|verbal noun of}}. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 07:25, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
:::I take it that, for English the idea of having "verbal noun" as a definition of an -ing-form of an English verb is that it thereby includes all current and future definitions of the verb lemma. As we put "present participle" alone as a definition under the Verb PoS, there is no explicit acknowledgment that -ing-forms can be used as nouns (eg, 'these belated shortenings of {{...}}'). This notion applies to all English -ing-forms of verbs. In fact, the two English uses of the template in question also put ''[[shortening]]'' and ''[[blottoing]]'' in [[:Category:English verbal nouns]] with some 90 members.
:::IMO, for English, the underlying issue would need to be addressed before we could take any action that would limit uses of this template and the category in English. If ''[[verbal noun]]'' is a term that is well defined as it applies in any language, as the census table below suggests that it does, then the template should be '''kept'''. Whether we should have the template throw an error message for languages for which we assert that the 'verbal noun' concept does not apply is a separate matter, linked to whether the corresponding categories should be deleted.
:::If this complicates our template/module practice, so much the worse for our uniformitarian template/module/category architecture. At least the module data tables allow for the complexity, though I wonder how much of the module's memory is consumed by invoking the tables. [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 12:20, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
:::: If verbal nouns are a well-defined inflection of verbs in some languages, then it might be ok to keep it. However, I have noticed that many entries, even in Irish and Arabic, give additional idiomatic definitions alongside the verbal noun definition. They are also categorised as noun lemmas in those languages, not as verb forms. That suggests to me that they are still derivational rather than inflectional. The fact that Irish has [[w:Irish_conjugation#Verbal_nouns|more than 10 different ways to make a verbal noun]] again suggests that this is word derivation, not inflection. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 21:05, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
::::: For all stems except the base stem, with rare exceptions that are still regular (I only know {{m|ar|ÿ™Ÿéÿ¨ŸíŸÅŸéÿßŸÅ}} from {{m|ar|ÿ¨ŸéŸÅŸéŸëŸÅŸé}} and {{m|ar|ÿ™ŸéŸÉŸíÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ±}} from {{m|ar|ŸÉŸéÿ±ŸéŸëÿ±Ÿé}}, normally form II has the verbal noun taKLƒ´M but a few geminate verbs deviate), all verbal nouns of the [[Appendix:Arabic verbs|stems II and higher]] are utterly predictable. For base stems they are usually too depending on the meaning and the past vowel: transitive verbs with the pattern KaLaMa are likely to have the verbal noun of the pattern KaLM, even if other forms also exist (for example {{m|ar|ŸÉŸêÿ™Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿéÿ©}} is normally the verbal noun of¬†{{m|ar|ŸÉŸéÿ™Ÿéÿ®Ÿé}}¬†but {{m|ar|ŸÉŸéÿ™Ÿíÿ®}} is understood too), verbs of the pattern KaLiMa that have a meaning that would be or is the passive of a transitive verb with the measure KaLaMa are likely to have the verbal noun form KaLaM. But not even plurals are wholly predictable. This shows that the predictability or the different ways to form certain needed forms does not say anything about their categorization.
::::: It does not need to be a ‚Äúwell-defined concept‚Äù. It is a lexicographical device to refer to ‚Äúall current and future definitions of the verb lemma‚Äù, since that‚Äôs the point, that these forms stay linked to the verb meanings, may they have additional idiomatic meanings or not. The link is there in all the languages I know: Arabic with you know what, the forms that are given in the conjugation tables, German with -en or -ung (the former related to a more concrete or singular act and the latter to procedures), English with -ing, Latin with -ti≈ç, its descendants also or by a clipping with a minor added vowel ({{cog|es|rechazo}} for {{cog|es|rechazar}}, {{cog|es|toque}} for {{cog|es|tocar}}), Slavic especially¬†{{m|sla-pro|*-n—åje}} and some specialized minor ones.
::::: Grammatically Arabic verbal nouns accept accusative objects and genitivus objectivus, the analogous in English, while Slavic, Latin, German only take genitivus objectivus, by I don‚Äôt think this distinction is relevant here.
::::: As a side note, the etymology is not relevant either for the categorization: The verbal noun may be formed from the verb or the verb be denominal.
::::: I note a false dichotomy that being a ‚Äúlemma‚Äù entails having own definitions, or in a compulsion to shed ‚Äúderivation‚Äù and ‚Äúinflection‚Äù. But it must not be like that we either attach forms like an appendage to ‚Äútrue, full‚Äù entries or cut any knot: this sacrifices reality for schematism, with little gain ‚Äì not even for the dogmatics, for who told you that derivation and inflection aren‚Äôt ambiguous in languages? You see, it‚Äôs even in English ambiguous and at the same time something that one would not care about for anything.
::::: Now I see why I {{temp|perfective form of}}/{{temp|imperfective form of}} has been deprecated, it is for the same reason while not being ‚Äúnot well-defined‚Äù, which I would have had difficulties to agree with. It would have been better to recognize that one item of such a pair is not ‚Äúform of‚Äù but it still would be wise to refer from one to the other ''in the meaning''. These forms live and die together, while they can as well live separately or only represent a part of the other (like {{m|ru|–ø–µ—Ä–µÃÅ—Ç—å}} which has different perfective forms according to sense). [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 22:20, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::: {{ping|Fay Freak}} It isn't a false dichotomy if you understand what the categories of "lemma" and "non-lemma" mean in the first place. A lemma is the kind of form you'd expect to find in the average dictionary, along with a definition. A non-lemma is a form that isn't given its own entry, but is instead grouped with the lemma it belongs to. Another way to see the split is between independent and dependent. An inflection can't exist without the verbal paradigm it belongs to, whereas a derivation can exist independent of other lemmas. If a verbal noun has a sense that it does not share with its verb, then that sense is its own noun, because it's independent from the verb. But the verbal noun itself is still dependent, attached to the verb, so the verb form and the noun are distinct. Moreover, a key difference between inflection and derivation is whether the category is optional or required.
::::::: {{ping|Rua}} This is exactly where the average dictionary is ambiguous, the nominalizations being mentioned in varying fashion, variously headword-like.
::::::: Be it so that a sense makes an own noun, it would mean that only because of this we would have two headers, two times ‚ÄúNoun‚Äú, from which the reader does not benefit. We might use a headword template that categorizes both as lemma and non-lemma. But this has nothing do with whether the definitions should have ‚Äúverbal noun of‚Äù. The definitions and their organization shall not be based on how one will categorize them. So no, [[T:verbal noun of]]¬†can‚Äôt be deleted. I disown the notion that because ‚Äúa sense‚Äù ‚Äúis a lemma‚Äù or ‚Äúa non-lemma‚Äù we can‚Äôt refer to other senses to define it ‚Äì {{temp|synonym of}}¬†is also handy, just by the way. You are committing a great paralogism here exemplified by your utterance ‚Äúsense is its own noun‚Äù: Nay obviously, ''a sense is not a noun'', this confuses subjects and predicates fundamentally. There are nouns and we see senses in them (hence their ‚Äúsenses‚Äù, because humans sense them), and the senses of one form might be either independent of another term, or wholly dependent on it as a mere inflexion, or loosely dependent on it. The lexicograph can tell people how usage is without deciding whether something is ‚Äúderivation‚Äù or ‚Äúinflexion‚Äú, or ‚Äúenclitic‚Äù or whatever, however nice there is a distinction in principle. I don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt think what a form like {{m|ar|ÿπŸÑŸâ|ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸáŸê|t=to him, to it}} with so-called ‚Äúpronominal suffix‚Äù is dogmatically but I know without this that nouns with these personal suffixes should not be included. For other things one knows that they should be included and how to gloss them but wits not how they should be classified or related to other terms: but one knows what is economical, knows a good effort-information ratio. The question for including or writing something is always: Will it provide essential information rather than just be expensive? Be it that the distinction is imprecise in this matter, so is language, and still if this is bad it does not follow that we can‚Äôt gloss this way. Semantics trumps grammar. The distinction has also nothing to do with predictability and lexicalization: it can vary by language and in a language what one has to memorize or if there are special forms that one has to know, with varying degrees of predictability.

:::::: {{ping|Mahagaja}} Would a verb without a verbal noun in the Goidelic languages be considered defective, or is that a normal state of affairs? {{ping|Benwing2}} The same question but for Arabic. That's not a rhetorical question, it's something I'd actually like to know because it's important in deciding whether to call these lemmas or non-lemmas. Based on the model of English gerunds, the standard treatment of such cases is to use the Verb heading for inflections, which are part of the verbal paradigm and whose sense is tied to the verb, and the Noun heading alongside that Verb heading for cases where a verb form has developed special senses that do not arise from the verb. If verbal nouns in these languages are inflectional, then this is the precedent we should follow for them. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 22:10, 24 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::: {{reply|Rua}} Of the verbs in [[:CAT:Irish defective verbs]], only {{m|ga|[[ar]][[arsa|(sa)]]}} and {{m|ga|feadair}} don't have verbal nouns; the others do. (The fact that {{m+|ga|is}} doesn't have a verbal noun is one of the many reasons why syntacticians, unlike language teachers, consider it a particle and not a verb, not even a defective one.) So even defective verbs tend to have verbal nouns; and nondefective ones always do. On the other hand, there are some verbs, like {{m|ga|caint}} and {{m|ga|magadh}}, that exist ''only'' as verbal nouns and have no finite forms. I do agree that from a purely morphological point of view, Goidelic verbal nouns are probably derivational rather than inflectional, but for speakers (both L1 and L2) the verbal noun is still an essential part of the paradigm, so you might say that they are "semantically inflectional" while being morphologically derivational. If you want to delete {{tl|verbal noun of}} to reduce the overall number of form-of templates, then that's okay, as long as I'm still allowed to use {{tl|inflection of|...|verbal noun}}. (Incidentally, the verbal noun is just as essential in Brythonic languages as in Goidelic ones; the reason there are no Brythonic languages in the table below is that for Brythonic languages we use the verbal noun as the lemma.) Lower Sorbian is in the list too; in that language verbal nouns are definitely inflectional and clearly part of the paradigm. As for the other languages I know in the table below, we can IMO eliminate "verbal noun" as a category for German, English, and French. ‚Äî[[User:Mahagaja|MahƒÅgaja]] ¬∑ [[User talk:Mahagaja|''talk'']] 07:46, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::::: We can keep the template if they are indeed a verb inflection for Goidelic. I'm not sure about the need for categorising them, though, but that is part of my suspicion of categorising non-lemmas in general. I don't find [[:Category:Irish verbal nouns]] particularly useful, anymore than something like [[:Category:Irish first-person singular present indicative forms]] would. More pressing, though, is that verbal nouns aren't in [[:Category:Irish verb forms]], when they clearly should be. I'm also not sure how to deal with an entry like {{m|ga|atriail}}. Given a strict separation of lemmas and nonlemmas, there would not be a "verbal noun of" sense here at all, because the verbal noun would be treated as a verb form and thus gets a Verb header and not a Noun header. On the other hand, verbal nouns have noun inflections and even genders, and it would be somewhat redundant to have two sections with the same inflections, one for the verbal noun and one for the remaining senses. But it still does not sit right with me that we treat verbal nouns as lemmas, when they are also a part of the verbal paradigm. Looking at English participles gerunds as an example, we don't have nouns defined with {{temp|gerund of}} either, nor do we have adjectives defined with {{temp|past participle of}}. Instead, whenever there are senses that are separate from the verb, they receive their own header, while those belonging to the verb get Verb. But that doesn't work as neatly with languages where verbal inflections can have genders and inflections, not just Irish but also Dutch and German. I'm not sure what to do here, and the discussion in [[WT:BP]] about gerunds stalled with no useful conclusion. I would like situations like this to have a standard treatment that fits many languages. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 10:30, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::::: I think verbal nouns are similar to participles in being in sort of simultaneously lemmas and nonlemmas, and we do have categories like [[:CAT:Dutch past participles]] and [[:CAT:Dutch present participles]], as well as [[:CAT:Dutch participle forms]], and I think we should keep them. So I don't think we can commit to "a strict separation of lemmas and nonlemmas" anyway. ‚Äî[[User:Mahagaja|MahƒÅgaja]] ¬∑ [[User talk:Mahagaja|''talk'']] 12:59, 25 April 2019 (UTC)

== Lesser used multicolumn templates ==

Now that {{temp|ant2}}, {{temp|coord2}}, {{temp|der2}}, {{temp|hyp2}}, {{temp|rel2}}, and {{temp|syn2}} are all aliases of {{temp|col2}}, and similarly for other numbers of columns, I suggest eliminating the lesser-used aliases. Following is a table of all the aliases and their uses (note that the #uses for the main template includes uses of the aliases). I suggest replacing and deleting all aliases with #uses < 1000 (the threshold I've been using for the need for deprecation). By this measure, we should keep {{temp|der2}}, {{temp|der3}}, {{temp|der4}}, {{temp|rel2}}, {{temp|rel3}}, {{temp|rel4}} and rename/delete the rest.

:: I'm sure there ''is'' a lot of arbitrary variation, but you're proposing to take away all flexibility so there's no way to deal with exceptional cases except by hard-coded kludges. There are factors in choosing a format such as the length of the terms (Chinese is very compact, an agglutinative language is going to be more diffuse), the number of the terms, the desired height and width to be occupied, and possibly others that neither you nor I is aware of. Sometimes two columns look fine and three look awful for no easily explainable reason. There's a fine line between a consistent "house style" and procrustean rigidity- "make everything use that" sounds a lot like the latter. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 18:35, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
::: My point is that the need for such flexibility has never been explained, and the way that one should choose the number of columns has never been documented anywhere. Instead, it's arbitrary as you say. It is trivially easy to choose the number of columns based on the length of the terms, so that in itself is not a reason to favour manually choosing. It merely codifies and automates what we already did by hand before. But perhaps we are going a step too far, and should really ''codify'' the guidelines first. I invite you to participate. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 18:46, 6 April 2019 (UTC)

Maybe we could do something like create CSS classes "multicol-2-3-4" (which means "two columns with narrow frames, 3 columns with mid-width frames, 4 columns with wide frames"), "multicol-3-4-6" (similar), etc., and then have the module code compute the length of the longest word and choose the appropriate CSS class.

It would probably be better to do it by hand rather than by module, since optimum width depends on the fonts that browsers happen to choose (though they may be nudged towards certain fonts by [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]), and a module can't adequately determine the widths of characters. If this option were taken, all the numbered column templates could be deprecated in favor of a single one with a width parameter, or maybe they could be replaced by column templates for narrow, medium, and wide columns.

<s>and a number of other "Male" and "Female" categories</s>, apparently all created by [[User:Hergilei]] 

These are misnamed: they're really masculine and feminine forms of various categories of nouns- there's really nothing in these that isn't covered by the corresponding categories without "Male" and "Female" in their names. In the languages I've looked at, the members for the "Male" category are the lemmas, and the members of the "Female" category are in the headword lines as feminine forms. These aren't anything lexically interesting like [[boar]] and [[sow]] or [[king]] and [[queen]], just predictable products of their languages' gender morphology. 

I think these have escaped notice because they have no English-specific categories, with the exception of [[:Category:en:Female people]], which only contains a single Old English entry. For some reason, the "Female" categories have been added to the modules, while the "Male" ones seem to all be in [[:Category:Categories with invalid label]]. I'm sure there's a lesson in that about gender attitudes, but "Male" and "Female" are both equally useless and should both be deleted.

: '''Delete'''. I don't think they should be named "masculine" and "feminine", because these are semantic categories and so they should be categorised by the referent rather than the word. If we really do consider these to be grammatical genders, there's nothing in principle against categories for ''neuter'' words in any of these categories, in languages that might have them. Consider that [[:Category:ang:Neuter family members]] could contain at least {{m|ang|wƒ´f}}, after all. So it's better to consider them as natural genders and keep the names "male" and "female". ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 16:10, 28 April 2019 (UTC)

Phonetic respellings should be handled differently. We normally don't have entries for words, which are phonetic representations of another word, unless they are attestable common respellings. It is useful to show them (unlinked), though, as in {{m|mn|–±–∞—è—Ä–ª–∞–ª–∞–∞}} (revision|52386186}}. If pronunciation module for Mongolian is eventually developed, these spellings can be used as parameters.

== [[Template:trans-mid]] ==

It may seem weird to nominate such a widely-used and critical template, but bear with me. Right now, we have templates that automatically split lists into columns, and as a result {{temp|mid4}} and its cousins actually contain no template code at all, they're just kept for compatibility. So, why not do the same for translation tables? If {{temp|trans-top}} is modified to use the automatic columns instead of the current table-based approach, then {{temp|trans-mid}} becomes obsolete just like {{temp|mid4}}. ‚Äî[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 13:55, 6 May 2019 (UTC)

:It's not redundant at all as there is a '''huge''' difference between gender (of words) and sex (of things and living beings).<br /> English ''actress'' (no gender; refering to someone with female sex) is the <u>female</u> equivalent of ''actor'' (no gender),<br /> while German terms in ''(...[[-er]])[[-in]]'' (feminine gender; female or no sex at all) are the <u>feminine</u> equivalent of terms in ''[[-er]]'' (masculine gender; male, female, unknown or no gender). Real-life examples:
:* "Lenin sah in der Partei die F√ºhrerin und Lehrerin der Massen" - {{m|de|F√ºhrerin}} and {{m|de|Lehrerin}} are feminine but here refer to a sexless thing.
:* "ein weiblicher Lehrer" (sg.), "weibliche Lehrer" (pl.) - {{m|de|Lehrer}} is masculine but here refers to female beings.
:* "m√§nnliche und weibliche Lehrer", "Lehrer beiderlei Geschlechts" - {{m|de|Lehrer}} is masculine but here refers to male and female beings.
:* "der Glaub ist der F√ºhrer der Hofnung" - {{m|de|F√ºhrer}} is masculine but here refers to a sexless abstract thing.

::{{ping|B-Fahrer|Fay Freak|DCDuring|Rua}} I don't really see the point of having separate templates {{temp|feminine equivalent of}}/{{temp|female equivalent of}} and {{temp|feminine noun of}}. All the templates are in practice used equivalently. The three examples above of ''Lehrer''/''F√ºhrer'' are irrelevant as they refer to the masculine form, which in many languages can also be used of female beings. The feminine form ''Lehrerin'', as far as I can tell, does normally refer to female beings. All examples on Glosbe of ''F√ºhrerin'' [https://glosbe.com/de/en/F√ºhrerin], for example, refer to women. It seems clear to me that the above example where ''Lehrerin'' and ''F√ºhrerin'' are used to refer to a political party is a marginal case as well as a clear example of personification. It is comparable to the use of ''she'' in English to refer to boats, airplanes, countries, etc. and ''he'' to occasionally refer to various programming language constructs; this does not change the fact that ''he'' and ''she'' are natural-gender pronouns. As a result I am planning on merging these templates. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 03:25, 1 October 2020 (UTC)
:::BTW I thought about this a bit more. There are cases in German like {{m|de|Herstellerin||manufacturer}} that are often used of non-human entities (in this case, companies) and cannot be called personifications. ({{m|de|Sammlerin||collector}} is claimed to be another instance, although the examples in Glosbe [https://glosbe.com/de/en/Sammlerin] all appear to refer to women.) This situation appears to be specific to German, and exceptional even in that language, where most words in ''-erin'' do appear to refer primarily to women. In my opinion, words like [[Herstellerin]] should not use {{temp|female equivalent of}} or any other similar variant, but should simply be defined as "manufacturer", possibly with a usage note indicating that they are normally used only to refer to feminine nouns (if that is indeed the case). If [[Sammlerin]] can equally refer to a woman who is a collector or to a non-human feminine-gender collecting object, it should have two definitions, one with {{temp|female equivalent of}} and the other defined as <code><nowiki>[[collector]] {{gloss|object that collects}}</nowiki></code> or similar, with a usage note.

== Deletion of [[Template:rel-top|rel-top]], [[Template:der-top|der-top]] and related templates ==

Hi, now that we got the {{temp|der3}} and {{temp|rel3}} working on the mobile frontend I suggest we retire the box-templates for derived and related terms that is not supported by a majority of users according to the [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour/2018/November#Titles_of_morphological_relations_templates|vote in BP in 2018]]. If we need a new vote, please state so and I will create a proper one.

The following templates are proposed deleted:
* {{temp|der-top}}
* {{temp|der-mid}}
* {{temp|der-bottom}}
* {{temp|rel-top}}
* {{temp|rel-mid}}
* {{temp|rel-bottom}}
The consequences of this will be: 
# We will only have boxes left on the translations
# We will have to convert from the old box-templates to the supported rel3/col3 ones. This might be possible with a clever bot.
WDYT?--[[User:So9q|So9q]] ([[User talk:So9q|talk]]) 22:11, 14 September 2019 (UTC)
: This does need a vote, because the BP discussion wasn't about getting rid of these templates.

::: A nested list: {{m|grc|œÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ}}. Another thing, lists with interspersed headings: {{m|grc|Œªœçœâ}}, {{m|grc|œÄŒªŒ≠œâ}}. Though they don't all look great, they convey extra information that a simple list of links does not. Perhaps there wouldn't be loss of information from the ones with interspersed headings if they were converted to {{temp|col3}} by splitting them into separate lists with a header ({{para|title}}), but I kind of like the more compact format. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 06:36, 15 September 2019 (UTC)
: Currently, {{temp|der-top}} and {{temp|der-bottom}} is being used in Han character entries for Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese compounds, so it is '''not''' possible to delete these two templates. The reason for using {{temp|der-top}} is because {{temp|der3}} consumes Lua memory whereas {{temp|der-top}} does not. See [[:CAT:E]] for Han character entries that have already exceeded default Lua memory despite using {{temp|der-top}}.

:: Ok, I understand.--[[User:So9q|So9q]] ([[User talk:So9q|talk]]) 18:27, 15 September 2019 (UTC)
:: Actually, I think the benefit of the top, mid, bottom templates in some of the Han character entries is that you can put anything inside them, including a linking template that invokes Lua only once (for instance, {{temp|ja-r/multi}} in [[Êúà#Japanese]]). But they may be less memory-efficient than {{temp|col3}} if they contain many instances of templates that invoke Lua (for instance, {{temp|ko-l}} in [[Â≠∏#Korean]]). In general the fewer Lua invocations, the less memory. ‚Äî [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]¬∑[[User talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 20:30, 15 September 2019 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the clarification. I didn't realize {{temp|der-top}} could be less memory-efficient if it contains a large number of Lua-invoking templates. When I tried to use {{temp|der3}} instead of {{temp|der-top}} for [[Â≠∏#Korean]] I found that {{temp|der-top}} used 4.04 MB compared to 4.49MB used by {{temp|der3}}. Since it is possible to further reduce memory for {{temp|der-top}} by using linking templates such as {{temp|ja-r/multi}}, it would not be wise to delete {{temp|der-top}} and {{temp|der-bottom}}.

Additionally I would like to get rid of {{temp|rel-top3}} and {{temp|rel-top4}}. {{temp|rel-top}} and {{temp|rel-top3}} is used in about 4000 pages that will need to be (bot) edited and converted to e.g. col3 when there are more than a few terms.

== [[:Category:Entries needing topical attention]], [[Wiktionary:Entries needing topical attention]] ==

The theory behind this category and Wiktionary page is that several request templates take a {{para|topic}} parameter, which if used places the page in [[:Category:Entries needing topical attention]]. Then, the page is added (by bot, ideally) to [[Wiktionary:Entries needing topical attention]], and is eventually supposed to be processed and removed. In practice, however, this mechanism is quite dormant. There are only 23 pages in [[:Category:Entries needing topical attention]], and [[Wiktionary:Entries needing topical attention]] hasn't been updated in 5 years (it was formerly updated by the bot of [[User:msh210]], who is now mostly inactive). I'm not sure if this mechanism ever worked well, and no one seems to care about it anymore, so I suggest removing it (i.e. delete the category and Wiktionary page, as well as the code in the various request templates that place pages in the category; see [[:Category:Request templates]]).

== [[:Category:English derived terms]] and all categories under it, [[Template:dervcat]] ==

{{ping|DCDuring|-sche|Rua|Renard Migrant}} Almost all categories under [[:Category:English derived terms]] are empty. The ones that aren't empty are populated manually, as there are no (remaining?) templates to populate those categories automatically. The idea appears to be to create categories for terms derived from common English words like "cat" and "load". This is potentially a good idea but doesn't seem to have worked out in practice. If we are to implement something like this it should probably be done either through {{temp|affix}} or {{temp|compound}} or through a mechanism similar to {{temp|desctree}}, which would automatically scrape a specified pages for derived terms. Rather than have what's essentially dead weight at this point hanging around, I propose deleting all the individual categories and the top-level category, removing the few manual invocations of those categories and removing the category boiler {{temp|dervcat}}. [[User:Benwing2|Benwing2]] ([[User talk:Benwing2|talk]]) 05:15, 21 October 2019 (UTC)
:The idea of autopopulated categories which would enable automagical displays under Derived terms headers is perfectly consistent with what we do under Descendants, but the polylingual lobby for doing so for Descendants has proven more powerful than the monolingual lobby for doing so under Derived terms. I suppose reminders of the loss should be razed. [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 10:30, 21 October 2019 (UTC)
::{{ping|DCDuring}} I could definitely implement something that works like {{temp|desctree}} and pulls from Derived terms, but I don't think it can populate a category. The problem here is that the only way I know of to get a page in a category is to link to the category on the page itself. What could be done however is create pages in some namespace whose contents are auto-generated, consisting of a table of links in some format, and which pull from Derived terms on a specified page. E.g. it could be called [[Derived terms:English/cat]] (with a short-form prefix "DT:"?) and have a simple page definition {{temp|deriv cat}} (or even just {{temp|auto cat}}). Or this could go into the Appendix or wherever. We have namespaces for rhymes, reconstructions, etc. so there is precedent. IMO this is more likely to work than going through {{temp|affix}} or {{temp|compound}} (which in the case of cat means that 118 pages must all have etymologies that mention the word "cat", vs. a single page that lists 118 derived terms, like we already have).

{{ping|Atitarev|Rua|Suzukaze-c}} With the exception of {{temp|zh-noun}} and {{temp|zh-punctuation mark}}, every one of these is a trivial wrapper around {{temp|head}}. {{temp|zh-verb}}, for example, is defined simply as follows:
:<pre>{{head|zh|verb}}<noinclude>{{documentation}}</noinclude></pre>
This proliferation of trivial templates doesn't accomplish anything, so I think they should all be orphaned and deleted/deprecated. From the history, they were all created by [[User:Atitarev]], and at the time they seem to have done something useful using {{temp|zh-pos}}. However, this is no longer the case, and {{temp|zh-pos}} itself no longer exists.

This rule applies to '''all''' transitive senses of '''all''' "verb-object" verbs, including [[Âä†ÈÄü]] mentioned below. There is no point to repeat stating a general rule in every definition.

I guess there are grammatical restrictions that make verb-object constructions inseparable if it takes an object, but when that happens, I don't know if we should still treat it a verb-object construction. It's not like Âá∫ is ditransitive in transitive Âá∫Ê´É, nor is transitive Âá∫Ê´É functioning as verb + object anymore from how I see it. I'm not familiar with how people have dealt with these, but I think we probably need some scholarly sources to back up our decisions.

Based on [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Tea_room/2020/October#Castleisland this discussion], there seem to be serious doubts about the proper scope of this and, especially, whether there is any practical way of automatically populating it in a way that seems appropriate. The non-category content (the text at the top) might make a good appendix. [[i before e except after c]] might make a good "proverb" which could link to said appendix.

:'''Keep''' - Rule is still being taught as mentioned at [[:wikipedia:en:I before E except after C]]. As creator of the category, my thought was just to list all the exceptions to the rule, mostly to show how ridiculously many there are. I don't endorse trying to decide which terms are "junk", e.g. should [[glycophosphoprotein]] be listed or not? If this category is useful and not hurting, why delete?

::{{ping|Andrew Sheedy}} I wonder how that can be done. It would seem to mean that both the pronunciation, presumably in the one or more IPA templates (if they exist}, and the spelling (in the headword template} would have to be read for the categorization work as you would wish it. I don't think things work that way, certainly not without a lot more resource use on each loading of the entry. If the bit of irrelevancy is to be kept, wouldn't it make more sense for this to be hard-coded once in a while (once a year, once a quarter, once a month) as the result of an analysis by an offline Python or Perl program? I don't think it would be too hard to find recent new entries that had "ie" or "ei" in them so the hard categorization could be added for new entries manually, online, should a user want the categories to be more up to date than would they would be with only a periodic offline run against the XML dump. [[User:DCDuring|DCDuring]] ([[User talk:DCDuring|talk]]) 05:06, 1 November 2020 (UTC)
::: I think hardcoding it once and then adding entries manually thereafter would be good enough. I can't imagine there are ''that'' many words that are exceptions to the more narrow rule. The category could have a note at the top explaining the more general exceptions (''ei'' spelling when pronounced /e…™/, order remaining the same when crossing morpheme boundaries, etc.). So many people learn this rule that I do think it has a use, just not in its current form (note that the category currently contains "words" like {{m|en|percieve}}!!).

*'''If kept''' it should absolutely be purged of all multi-word combinations. It makes ''some'' sense to include "science", "deficiency", and "ancient", but none at all to include [[Academy of Sciences]], [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]], or [[Ancient Church of the East]]. I would perhaps split out the words which disobey the rule for having an "ei" from those that disobey it by having an "ie after c". Also, I recall that the full ''rule'' says "or when sounding like A, as in neighbor or weigh", which also seems like a basis for excluding from this category (but perhaps for having a category for "words with an 'ei' pronounced as a long 'a'".

The purpose is not simply to list every species of animal. It is a thesaurus-type page listing the names of common animals, along with the particular name of males, females, and young, the normal word for the place they live, the usually onomatopaeic word for the sound they make, the adjective describing them (like "bovid" for cows), and so forth. This is an appendix page I have not only used but found useful. Please explain what you would replace it with should it be deleted.

*:: {{re|Andrew Sheedy}} I found it chaotically formatted and deemed it inefficient; with the section ‚ÄúTerms to be checked‚Äù it also looks aborted, which indicates lacking interest.

I now find similar in [[Appendix:Hungarian animal sounds]] but this is not well formatted. On the other hand the pages of individual animals are the places to go to for all questions regarding whether and what terms there are for males and females, youngs, their abodes, calls, relative adjectives, and in other languages. For animals like the {{m|en|horse}} there will also be far more complicated vocabulary than can be shoehorned into such a panzootic table. I think it is wrong to have the animal first and then glean terms for groups, homes, males and females etc. of the animal.

I've seen similar tables in encyclopedias. I don't think we should delete it just because you don't like it, or because it isn't regularly maintained. Perhaps it isn't maintained because there aren't any glaring omissions? There are, after all, a finite number of commonly known animals, and this covers most of the one's you'd be likely to come across.

*'''Keep'''. As far as I can tell, this isn't a "straight copy" and is simply an index selecting only essential headwords and glosses at the top of every entry. See for instance [http://uralonet.nytud.hu/eintrag.cgi?id_eintrag=1 1], [http://uralonet.nytud.hu/eintrag.cgi?id_eintrag=2 2], [http://uralonet.nytud.hu/eintrag.cgi?id_eintrag=3 3]. It's not wholesale copying of the entire entries with all of the notes, etymologies, reflexes, and other footnotes. The appendix is copiously referenced and gives proper attribution. Plus, it links to all the original online entries and nicely complements rather than replaces the original etymological database. Linguists and lexicographers generally wouldn't believe a list of proto-forms without sufficient cited evidence, so this appendix would serve to "whet their appetite" for looking things up in the original etymological database. Also, to be extra certain, we might as well check Hungarian copyright law, but I doubt there would be anything giving us definitive answers on how to deal with etymological indices, just as [[w:Wikipedia:Copyright in lists|Wikipedia:Copyright in lists]] doesn't give us any definitive answers for such a niche subject. Even seasoned copyright lawyers would all have their own opinions. To me, this is a case of reasonable use of open-access lexical data, and everyone would benefit from [[m:Avoid copyright paranoia|not having copyright paranoia]] as advised on Meta.

:Furthermore, by now it's common, conventional practice in the linguistics community to build and host public open-access lexical databases featuring wholesale reproduction of previously published word lists as long as proper attribution is given, as with [http://reflex.cnrs.fr/Africa/ Reflex] (African languages), [https://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl STEDT] (East Asian languages, has lists like [https://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl/gnis?lexicon.lgid=1988 this]), and many others. The general consensus among historical linguists is that these kinds of open-access databases do not violate copyright.

:As for duplicating Wiktionary entries, I don't see the need to eliminate an appendix if it's seen as redundant to what a category already has. Indices are actually quite helpful in their own right.

:The other more experienced members should have more insights, but my feeling is that this really looks like a keep. [[User:Kongolex|Kongolex]] ([[User talk:Kongolex|talk]]) 01:52, 22 December 2020 (UTC)

*'''Move''' to a different namespace. This is clearly useful for developing WP's Proto-Uralic / Finno-Ugric appendices, but it also clearly needs cleanup (e.g. what's the point of the extensive tables describing phonemes in Hungarian? why is Finnish privileged as the only language whose reflexes are given?) and numerous updates. Uralonet is exlusively based on {{temp|R:UEW}} from 1988 and even the supplementary bibliography has nothing in it after 2005; also no authors in it who aren't retired by now).

Created after [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2019/September#First attestations in the etymology section|this discussion]] to abandon the functionalities of {{tl|ko-etym-native}} and move to {{tl|inh|ko|okm}} instead, which I can't really agree with. First attestations are given in the standard Korean dictionaries, and there are a number of benefits to Wiktionary doing so as well:

* It's more detail we won't be providing, which I think is a bad thing.
* There are important differences between fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Middle Korean, and this is obscured by using {{tl|inh|ko|okm}} only. I would also add that specifying the source immediately allows a knowledgeable reader to understand the nature of the word, e.g. a Middle Korean word first attested in ''Childae manbeop'' is highly likely to be southeastern dialectal, and a word first attested in personal letters is likely to be a colloquial form. This is all valuable information lost. 
* {{tl|inh}} will not work at all for Early Modern Korean because {{tl|inh|ko|ko-ear}} causes a module error (a language cannot inherit from a variant of itself).

== [[Afghan hound]] ==

Is there a reason for keeping both ''[[Afghan Hound]]'' and ''[[Afghan hound]]''? I would keep only [[Afghan hound]], just like we keep only ''[[red fox]]'', not ''[[Red Fox]]''. [[User:Lmaltier|Lmaltier]] ([[User talk:Lmaltier|talk]]) 05:56, 1 October 2014 (UTC)
:Outside of the fields of dog breeding, training, etc, in fiction, for example, ''Afghan hound'' seems overwhelmingly preferred. Newspaper usage looks split, with reports on dog shows tending toward capitalization. I expect that those motivated to add entries for dog breeds prefer the capitalized form. If it were easy to get counts of a large sample of usage we could rely on such counts to indicate which should be the main form. I'd say that we need a generic usage note on the spelling for entries with both capitalizations. My preference is that we default to having the lowercase form as the main one (with the usual capitalization of proper noun/adjective components like ''Afghan''). [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  11:53, 1 October 2014 (UTC)
::Definitely redirect ''[[Afghan Hound]]'' to ''[[Afghan hound]]''. The "H" is found mostly in those (primarily [[w:WP:SSF|specialist, non-general]]) sources that capitalize Important Words in their Jargons. This is the same basic issue that was discussed [[Wiktionary:Beer parlour#Birds_in_English|in WT:BP#Birds]] (see also my comment there), and Lmaltier's comparison to "Red Fox" is also apt.

:::I detect creeping prescriptivism. If the specialist dog and cat people and horticulturalists capitalize terms not capitalized in general literature, that's something to be described not proscribed. I suppose we could incorporate a usage note into the entry and have hard redirects where possible, but that usage note does not now exist at [[Afghan hound]]. I don't see why we should discourage specialists from adding content at the capitalization of their choice. Whatever the situation with birds, where there was disagreement among nearly equal-sized groups of specialists, [[w:Afghan Hound]] is the location of corresponding WP entry. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  19:20, 2 October 2014 (UTC)
:: Some points are clear: 1. capitalized or not, it's the '''same''' word, with the same spelling. 2. Capitalization can be used for all animal or plant names; it's not a "specialist spelling", not at all, capitalization is used to make more explicit the fact that the name is used in a generic way (it's true in English, and in other languages too). This is what happens in Wikipedia: the Wikipedia page uses ''Hound'' when it's a generic use, when referring to the species (but it's not mandatory), and ''hound'' when referring to individuals (''two Afghan hounds''), because it's not a generic use. Capitalization in sentences also makes something more explicit: this is the beginning of a sentence. There are other meanings of capitalization as well. 3. It would be absurd to duplicate all words because all words can be capitalized in some cases. It would be equally absurd to duplicate millions of animal or plant names for this reason. It's not prescriptivism to choose ''we'' rather than ''We'' as the page title: everybody knows that the word can be capitalized when needed or preferred.

== Postvocalic -r in English phonemic IPA ==

In rhotic varieties of English, the phoneme {{IPAchar|/…π/}} triggers different pronunciations of the preceding vowel. For example, {{IPAchar|/e…™ÃØ/}} + {{IPAchar|/…π/}} triggers {{IPAchar|[…õ…ô…π]}}. But this is completely allophonic as far as I know, as the combination {{IPAchar|[e…™ÃØ…π]}} cannot exist in English, nor can {{IPAchar|[…õ…ô]}} at least in rhotic varieties. I think that, at least for phonemic pronunciations, we should not indicate this allophony but note the underlying phonemes that these are allophones of. Otherwise we end up with a half-phonemic transcription, which is not what / / means. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 15:45, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
: I '''oppose'''. The situation is much more complicated than that and anyway, in our current system /…õ…ô…π/ is defined as a single phoneme, making it completely consistent with a phonemic transcription. --[[User:Wikitiki89|Wiki]][[User talk:Wikitiki89|Tiki]][[Special:Contributions/Wikitiki89|89]] 17:13, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
:: But it's not really a phoneme. Otherwise you could just say that every possible word is its own phoneme, which misses the whole point of splitting words into phonemes in the first place. So what is so complicated about this, that would preclude saying that "stare" is simply "stale" with one consonant phoneme replaced with another? Remember that phonemes are concerned the bare ''minimal'' distinguishing pieces that make up words, so any redundancy and allophony is removed. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:21, 3 October 2014 (UTC)

::::: If it's not, then it implies there are cases where both vowels can appear before the same consonant, and therefore contrast with each other. But I don't know any cases of that. They seem to be in complementary distribution. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:12, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
::::: [[w:English phonology]] seems to agree with me, and doesn't mention any special phonemes before {{IPAchar|/…π/}}. But it shows things somewhat differently from how I would analyse it. Where I would say that ''stare'' has the phoneme {{IPAchar|/e…™/}}, Wikipedia says it has {{IPAchar|/…õ/}}. My analysis is more diachronic I suppose, and partly based on spelling. If you consider the Great Vowel Shift, then it makes perfect sense to see ''stare'' as simply ''stale'' with one consonant replaced, they were both simply {{IPAchar|/staÀêl/}} and {{IPAchar|/staÀêr/}} in late Middle English, which the Great Vowel Shift then changed to {{IPAchar|/st…õÀêl/}} and {{IPAchar|/st…õÀêr/}}. The vowel of the former then was raised further and diphthongized, while the latter kept its original value till today. In any case, there is no justification in the well-sourced Wikipedia article for considering {{IPAchar|/…õ…ô/}} or {{IPAchar|/e…ô/}} distinct phonemes in rhotic accents. ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:22, 3 October 2014 (UTC)
:::::: All that's true historically, but synchronically it's less obvious, and it's not made any easier by the fact that most discussions of English phonology consider only RP (which is nonrhotic) and/or General American (which has the Mary/merry/marry merger). There's very little discussion of rhotic accents in which ''stare'' has the same vowel as ''Mary'' but a different vowel than ''merry''. Scottish English is described as having the situation you describe, but in ScEng the vowel isn't actually different before ''r'' than before ''l''; ''stare'' and ''stale'' are just /steÀêr/ and /steÀêl/. American accents without the MMM merger usually also have √¶-tensing, with the result that /…õ…ô ~ e…ô/ appears not only in ''Mary'' but also in ''pass'' and ''pan''. And then there's ''yeah'' /j…õ…ô ~ je…ô/, which forms a minimal pair with ''yea'' /je…™/. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 20:11, 4 October 2014 (UTC)

CodeCat -- In the historical dialect which was kind of the last common ancestor of modern standard American and modern standard British, there were several vowel sounds which could only occur before an [r] consonant: […õÀê], […úÀê], [oÀê].  (In almost all modern dialects, old [oÀêr] and […îÀêr] have now merged, but […õÀêr] and […úÀêr] are often still relevant.)  At least […õÀêr] and [oÀêr] were originally allophones in the historical dialect, but I strongly doubt that that's the case for the descendant of […õÀêr] in many dialects today...

: I know, I specifically said ''rhotic'' dialects.

    Lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.
    Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.

== Please help fix plural of OS and remove OSes or refine. ==

Hi. 
I am not good at making the changes using wiktionary and wikipedia, so could others, who are fluent in usage of these places, please make the following additional change to https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/OS and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/OSes#English:

It is absolutely incorrect to state OSes is plural of OS when OS represents Operating System and Ordnance Survey.  The correct plural of the OS initialism is OSs.  I have found discussions on this that are old and new.  Others have already covered this, but throughout Wiktionary it is sated wrong because an incorrect usage of the automated plural listing is being done.
You can reference a detailed examination here: http://technotes.whw1.com/computer-related/operating-systems/22-what-is-the-plural-of-os-operating-system

If and when OS represents Outsize, and Old Style, which are very uncommon, and rarely used, then one may argue it is OSes.  So, if someone wants to state two plural variations for OS in Wiktionary (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/OS), depending what the Initialism represents, then that seems fine.  But, again, OSes is completely incorrect to represent Operating Systems and Ordnance Surveys.  You can reference the plural form of the word Survey here http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/survey?s=t to get a understanding why it would be OSs when the phrase ends with the word Surveys.

: "an incorrect usage of the automated plural listing is being done" - incorrect; your -s plural would be the default; the -es has been specifically stated by a user. And you can prove that it's widely used by simply googling "OSes". Your rule does not apply; we are a [[descriptive]] dictionary, not a [[prescriptive]] one, so we go by actual usage; "OSes" is common. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|‚óë]] 21:17, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

: I've now added two examples of "OSes" from published books. There are many more to be found. (Note also, if you want to make up arbitrary rules, you could argue for "OSes" because of the confusion between "OSs" and "OSS", or "open-source software"!)

== [[concern]] in [[:w:passive voice]]==

I found this in WP:[[:w:agrammatism]]:
:''There is little written about agrammatism. The beginnings of the field should be encountered in the work of Pe√±a-Casanova & Baguny√†-Durich (1998), and Junque et al. (1989). These papers do not describe case reports, they are rather '''concerned in''' more general topics such as lesion localization or rehabilitation of agrammatic patients.''
I obviously changed it to ''dealing with more general topics'', but my doubt is:
* I guess ''concern'' can be used in passive voice: ''I was concerned'', but I wanted to confirm that the preposition used is ''by''. Or ''I was concerned with/about/in this problem'' are also valid?

== Tesco's financial [[black hole]] ==

I have noticed that the British press keeps using the term "black hole" to discuss ¬£250m of bogus profits in Tesco's accounts like in http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/tsco/11156131/Tesco-audit-chairman-set-to-leave-as-director.html and http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1316101/fifth-exec-sucked-tescos-250m-black-hole/ . However, our page named [[black hole]] does not cover this case. Could someone familiar with British accounting terms please add that definition to the [[black hole]] page? I am not a British English person, so I am rather unqualified for this. Being an American who is interested in accounting fraud, I would have used the terms "accounting error", "accounting mistake", "accounting fraud", "accounting scandal", "bogus profits", or "cooked books" depending on the whether there was fraud involved or if this was just a genuine mistake.

== Earthian  noun ==

Earthian

noun

A single or multi-celled organism that works to heal itself physically, emotionally and/or spiritually.

the idea that an earthian is only a human shaped organism because it considers itself capable of dominating all other life forms, and considers itself only of communicating with other species when found in this universe is egotistical in the extreme.

Life depends on single celled organisms that convert chemicals into organic matter. Thus the first earthians to exist on this planet were single celled. The single celled organism are staff and the multi-celled organisms are dependent organisms that over time resulted in a symbiotic relationship with and assisted single cells to survive.

My understanding was that this is an informal version of "in conclusion" - i.e. "having taken everything into account..."

* I've always read it the same way that Tooironic has. Sometimes it carries the implication given in the entry - specifically, that while the text appears to push one viewpoint, it acknowledges its own bias and hasn't "considered all things" - but it seems to have quite a few other nuances depending on context. For example, the quote from Robinson Crusoe, "''We had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends, as above, and we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered.''" doesn't mean "We lived well, despite possible indications to the contrary" but that "We lived well, given the constraints of the situation".

*Our entry seems to be trying to hold the user's hand for some discourse analysis. It seems to me to go far beyond what is usefully lexical. That the expression could be used in a variety of situations where its implications are significantly different is true, but the same could be said about about ''[[yes]]'' and ''[[no]]''. The three verbose definitions risk impeding users trying to understand the expression.

** I'd disagree - I think we have the minimal number of distinct senses right now (although I have moved the most general definition to first place). In terms of more-or-less synonyms, it's 1) [[by and large]], 2) [[as a matter of fact]], 3) [[as far as it goes]]. They could be made less verbose ("generally speaking", "actually", "relatively speaking", maybe) but I think each one conveys useful lexical information - much more than a quasi-SOP definition like "taking everything into account" would.

== Nasal + f sequences in Latin ==

As far as I know, many sources agree that Latin turned sequences of vowel + nasal consonant into nasal vowels before fricatives. These then became long non-nasal vowels in the development to Vulgar Latin. But while there are plenty of cases with -s-, what about -f-? Most sources seem to write {{m|la|ƒ´nfƒÅns}} with the length marks suggesting nasalisation, but the development to Old French {{m|fro|enfes}} suggests that this sequence was not affected the same way. Instead of becoming a long vowel, the development is as a short vowel with the usual lowering, and the nasal consonant is preserved. So I wonder, were these sequences nasalised in the same way in earlier Latin? It seems unlikely {{IPAchar|[Ààƒ©Àêf√£Àês]}} could become {{m|fro||enfes}}, so was it really {{IPAchar|[Àà…™…±f√£Àês]}}? ‚Äî[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 19:41, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

:Some traditionalist sources claim that in Classical Latin "A vowel before nf, ns, gm, gn is long by nature" (Gildersleeve and Lodge's ''Latin Grammar'' p. 7), but I'm not sure how this correlates with developments into Romance...

I am no good at pinning down accents, but is there somewhere west of the North Atlantic where "[[√ó]]", in the phrase "10 x the capacity", is regularly pronounced "eks" rather than "times", or is it just Ned Desmond's idiolect -- see 01.41 in the attached video (or from 01.36 in context) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29740654]?

::: Much the same in the UK -- I've only heard ''et al'', and ''20eks'' may be normal too, though I can't at present remember any pronunciation for that.  I think I've only ever heard ''9 times zoom'', etc, but to be fair, I haven't heard many people talk about zoom lenses.  I was merely intrigued at hearing ''10eks the capacity'' since I'd never heard ''eks'' spoken when in the middle of a phrase (I would take ''20√ó'' as being the description of the drive type, rather than the √ó alone being part of the phrase; in the phrase ''recording speed 20 √ó playback'' I would expect to hear ''times''. So I was wondering if the ''eks'' usage in the middle of a phrase was widespread in some area of the USA or Canada.  Many -- perhaps most -- abbreviations have common "spelling pronunciations", but a fair number do not, and in my limited experience (mainly London, UK), this (if it is an abbreviation) has been one of the latter.  One further oddity is that it is not an x or X, since those are not usually written with the two strokes exactly at right angles.  It is an √ó, drawn as a + turned through 45¬∞ (though I'm not claiming that that is its origin).  Anyway, if it is thought of as a symbol, rather than an abbreviation, similar comments apply -- in my experience of maths, Œ£ is often pronounced ''sigma'' even though that is longer than saying ''sum'', and Œ¥x is pronounced ''delta eks'' so often that I've forgotten the formal title for what Œ¥ represents, possibly ''small incremental difference''.  But we usually say ''plus'', ''minus'', ''times'', and various things for ''divided by''.  And we speak of the ''plus sign'', ''minus sign'', ''multiplication (or times) sign'' and ''divide (or various others) sign''.  Just idle curiosity though -- I'm not suggesting we should change the entry for √ó. [[User:Enginear|--Eng<font color="green">in</font>ear]] 18:03, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

For example, somebody might satisfy the second definition of ambidexterity but not satisfy the first definition because they are highly skilled at writing forwards with their right hand and writing backwards with their left hand but less skilled at writing forwards with their left hand and writing backwards with their right hand. In fact does the definition of ambidexterity require that somebody actually uses a tool with both hands equally often rather than that they have the skill to do so? Similarly, if somebody suddenly decides to switch from using their right hand to using their left hand for every thing, are they defined to become [[left-handed]] right away because that's the hand they normally use or are they defined to become [[left-handed]] once their left hand passes their right hand in skill level?

: I don't think anyone in the world's qualified to answer that; it's purely a matter of opinion. Having said that I never met anyone or heard of anyone that's really equally good as lots of things left-handed and right-handed. I think {{m|en|de facto}} it's used for people who do some tasks naturally left-handed and some tasks naturally right-handed. Dictionaries give broad definitions an ignore completely different nuances that different speakers give to words. That's for a reason, if there are half a billion speakers of a language, who do you cover all those nuances? You don't. In the same way that an average IQ of 100 in a group doesn't mean that all of them have an IQ of exactly 100.

:To attempt some sort of answer I'll use specific examples. There's a minor league pitcher called [[:w:Pat Venditte|Pat Venditte]] who can pitch right- and left-handed because he's been raised to do that by his father from a young age. Bu his fastball is about 10mph slower as a leftie. By what I'd call the usual definition of ambidextrous, he qualifies because he can do the task to a high and similar standard right- and left-handed. I doesn't have to be identically good. As for the left-handedness question, some might consider right-handedness a quality you can never get rid of (apart from losing function in your right hand) no matter how much someone only uses their left-handed. 'Preference' doesn't really mean 'choice' in the sense of 'I prefer chocolate to fruit'. [[w:Rafael Nadal|Rafael Nadal]] is famous for being a left-handed tennis player who's right-handed for everything else, so you can call him right-handed or left-handed as long as your context is right.

:Back to our entry [[ambidextrous]], I have no idea if the bit about writing is right, is it ''especially'' about writing? Furthermore usually it refers to people doing tasks to a similar and competent level both sides. For example a complete inability to do something right- and left-handed not usually an example of ambidexterity! On the other hand "having equal ability in both hands" could be part of a speaker's mental definition of the word, even if on closer examination it turns out not to be factually very good. Words don't need to be limited to factually accurate things, we have words for [[dragons]], [[unicorns]] and whatnot.

:Ultimately, words are defined by usage, if most people use use a word to mean X, it comes to mean X, regardless of what some authority might have said up to that point.  The tricky part for Wiktionary, or for any dictionary, is to correctly identify the consensus.  The latin root implies equally proficient, but this is extremely rare.  Even persons who initially have no predisposition to prefer one hand over the other will pick one and get more practice doing particular tasks with a particular hand, leading to a snowball effect.  Preferring the left hand for some tasks and the right for others is fairly common and is usually referred to as "being ambidextrous".  My son is like that and I'm unaware of any other term for it, at least in common usage.  In baseball, players are rarely referred to as ambidextrous; "switch hitter" or "bats left, throws right" are the most common terminology.  I had taken that as an indication that "ambidextrous" refers primarily to inborn preference, while learned ability to be proficient with the non-dominant hand for strategic advantage or due to disability isn't really part of how people understand the word.--[[User:Wcoole|Wcoole]] ([[User talk:Wcoole|talk]]) 19:47, 27 October 2014 (UTC)

== Correct Latin translation ==

I want to verify the Google translator to make sure I have made the correct translation.  I don't know the nuances of Latin ... so I want to make sure I have the translation correct. I want to translate "for the one beside me" correctly.  The spirit of the phrase is one of camaraderie among those accomplishing group accomplishments, and being there to support the person I'm working with.  Originally, "for the man beside me" was what we were planning on translating, but wanted to make a non-gender statement.  

The current Google translation is for this is "quoniam absque me".  I'd like to ensure this is correct, or get the correct translation if it is not.

Thanks for any help you can provide.
:No, what Google gave you is nonsense. It basically means "because apart from me". I'd say ''pro homine iuxta me'' "for the person beside me" or ''pro iuxta me sedente'' "for the one sitting beside me" or ''pro iuxta me stante'' "for the one standing beside me" or even just ''pro socio meo'' "for my associate/companion". I'd personally recommend the last one, as Latin is a quite direct language that tends to take things very literally and avoid metaphors. ‚Äî[[User:Angr|A…¥…¢ Ä]] ([[User talk:Angr|''talk'']]) 18:50, 26 October 2014 (UTC)

== [[–≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω—ã–π]] ==

The entry for [[–≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω—ã–π]] is interesting, as this is an adjective, not a participle, although the English phrase "a boiled egg" shows that this distinction is not important in English. Contrast –≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω–æ–µ —è–π—Ü–æ, a boiled egg (adjective) and –≤–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–º —è–π—Ü–æ, an egg boiled by him (participle). But if you look at the entry for –≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω—ã–π, you will see that it says that it can be confused with the participle –≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π, but hold on, the participle isn't –≤–∞—Ä—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π, but [[–≤–∞ÃÅ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π]]....

I've started reading the pre-revolutionary spelling version of Crime and Punishment available as a free PDF from imwerden.

But [[—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ|—çÃÅ—Ç–æ–≥–æ]] is an exception - this is found as [[—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ]] throughout in that book, and I checked in a PDF of the collected works of Dostoyevsky in pre-revolutionary spelling, and yes it was [[—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ]]. Yet Tolstoy (on Wikisource) has [[—ç—Ç–∞–≥–æ]] in pre-revolutionary spelling. Is it possible that [[—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ]] was preferred by Dostoyevsky because it preserved the link with [[—Ç–æ–≥–æ]]? Also I noticed [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞–≥–æ]] in this book, which modern editions have changed to [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–≥–æ]], but I think they do so incorrectly, as Dahl's dictionary has both [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–π|–º–æ–ª–æ–¥–æÃÅ–π]] and [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–π|–º–æ–ª–æÃÅ–¥—ã–π]] as words, the latter an older variant probably, and it is likely that Dostoyevsky intended to show [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞–≥–æ]] was not stressed on the ending, i.e. that this was the gs of [[–º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–π|–º–æ–ª–æÃÅ–¥—ã–π]]. Does anyone have a better explanation of why Dostoevsky spelt [[—ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ]] thus, despite the fact the ending was not under stress? {{unsigned|81.141.8.102|02:48, 2 December 2020 (UTC)}}

There were many debates before 1918 regarding letter {{m|ru|—ë}} usage, which some viewed as "too colloquial" or illiterate to be used not only in writing but also in the pronunciation, which doesn't always make sense from the modern Russian perspective. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli T.]] <sup>([[User talk:Atitarev|–æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏—Ç—å]]</sup>/<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Atitarev|–≤–∫–ª–∞–¥]])</sup> 03:50, 2 December 2020 (UTC)
:::::: You mean you could hazard a guess from the spelling as to what the author intended, but couldn't be sure. Eg. in Crime and Punishment, where Dostoyevsky has –º–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞–≥–æ, he ''might'' have had –º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–π rather than –º–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–π in the nominative, but you couldn't be sure purely from the spelling he used. Also in that book I found –≥—Ä–æ—à–µ–≤—ã—Ö—ä (half-pennyworth), which ''might'' indicate he had –≥—Ä–æ—à–µ–≤–æ–π and not [[–≥—Ä–æ—à–æ–≤—ã–π]] (both are in Dahl's dictionary). Another interesting insight I have got from reading this is that Dostoyevsky had —É–∂—ä for [[—É–∂]], but Dahl had —É–∂—å with a ''soft'' sign (maybe on the analogy with words like [[—Ä–æ–∂—å]] with a soft sign).[[Special:Contributions/81.141.8.102|81.141.8.102]] 10:37, 3 December 2020 (UTC)
::::::: {{re|81.141.8.102}} I don't want you to make wrong assumptions. ''-–∞ÃÅ–≥–æ'', when the penultimate syllable was stressed (with -–æÃÅ–π-adjectives), was pronounced mostly ''-–æÃÅ–≤–æ'' but the older pronunciation ''-–∞ÃÅ–≥–æ'' was retained by priests. It is confusing, that's why the reform addressed this, which was especially helpful for this ending. "–∞" is never pronounced as "–æ" in stressed position in modern Russian.
::::::: [[User:Benwing2]] has added an additional form on my request, so that pre-reform declensions contain both ''-–∞ÃÅ–≥–æ'' and ''-–æÃÅ–≥–æ'' with -–æÃÅ–π-adjectives. The gradual switch to ''-–æÃÅ–≥–æ'' for such adjectives happened BEFORE the 1918 reform.

== estar que... ==

Spanish question for {{ping|Friendly2Face|Vivaelcelta|Metaknowledge|Pablussky|Tanisds}} et al. I recently made a bunch of these - [[estar que se sube por las paredes]], [[estar que se sale]], [[estar que arde]], [[estar que no est√°]], and want to add more, like [[estar que se cae]] and [[estar que se caga]]. But I was having second thoughts, firstly about the lemma (it should probably be something like [[estar que caerse]], although that looks pretty ugly), and secondly if we want this information at [[estar]] (or [[estar que]]?) and/or the relevant entries [[subirse]], [[salirse]], [[arder]], [[caerse]]. [[User:Returning2stadia|Returning2stadia]] ([[User talk:Returning2stadia|talk]]) 14:05, 2 December 2020 (UTC)
:I don't think there's one answer for all of those, and each case should be examined separately. For example, I think for the two first expressions, the main lemma should be [[subirse por las paredes]] and [[salirse]], yet [[estar que arde]] seems fine as a main lemma for me. Something like ''estar que caerse'' just makes no sense in Spanish, so I'd leave it as ''estar que se cae'', explaining on the entrance the different forms depending on the person (''estoy que me caigo'', ''est√°s que te caes'', and so on). Same with [[estar que arde]] or [[estar que no est√°]]. And I think I would add these to the relevant entries, not to [[estar]]. But all of this is my opinion, and I don't really know much about the ways of Wiktionary in these whatabouts. [[User:Pablussky|Pablussky]] ([[User talk:Pablussky|talk]]) 14:17, 2 December 2020 (UTC)

:I agree with Pablussy (if I am understanding the first question correctly). Its being conjugated in the sort of third person singular/impersonal makes the most sense since ''estar que'' leads into a subordinate clause, which of course by definition, requires a subject and conjugated verb. In the cases of {{m|es|tener algo que ver con}}, {{m|es|qu√© tienen que ver los cojones con comer trigo}} however, that's fine because ''tener que'' doesn't induce a subordinate clause.
:And I'm not the most well-versed in Wiktionary convention either. Like I read through the stuff, but I could be speaking in the wrong. But I agree with Pablussy that for the idiom "to be on fire" as in "doing really well", ''estar que arde'' makes the most sense because 3rd person singular is sort of the impersonal in this case.

:For ''salirse'', I would probably not create a separate entry for ''salir que''/''salirse que'' only because in the case of that idiomatic meaning of ''to get out that'', there is not a standard verb I can think of that follows always in the dependent clause. But there are also several regional variant uses of ''salir que'', so there could be a part of the Spanish speaking world where a specific verb always follows ''salir(se) que'' that I am not thinking of for a specific meaning. In that case, if it were super common and constitutes its own meaning to where ''salir(se) que + verb'' only has that meaning when that other verb follows it, then it would make sense for that to have its own entry. ''Estar que arde'' very much has a specific idiomatic meaning that really stands apart on its own, which is why it makes sense to have an entry for that. Hopefully, I understood the questions correctly. [[User:Friendly2Face|Friendly2Face]] ([[User talk:Friendly2Face|talk]]) {{unsigned||18:26, 2 December 2020 (UTC)}}

For this reason, Noah Webster was able to publish a dictionary and list new spellings. I could publish a dictionary tomorrow. I assume you might be Icelandic, and maybe there is a body that regulates Icelandic? Merriam-Webster does not control the English language.

If you look at Lexico (https://www.lexico.com/definition/anti-vaxxer), you will see the word in question is listed on a site run by the OED as "informal". It will not be regarded by all native speakers as a "proper word". Some dictionaries may choose to regard it as so, or as slang, or to categorise it in some other way. The real authority of dictionaries lies in their use by the educated middle class in the absence of an Acad√©mie.

This is in contrast with most of the other terms in that table, which have "God" for at least one of the senses. In my limited experience with Japanese, I am pretty sure that I have heard „ÄåÁ•ûÊßò„Äç used for/in reference to ''God''.

I don't know what (if any) differences there are/might be in relative usage between the Japanese terms given in that translation table, so I don't know if one word is used more than another, or if some are situationally-limited. I would imagine that there is a possibility that „ÄåÁ•û„Äç (by itself, without the „ÄåÊßò„Äç) could come off as ambiguous if it were used in any and every situation to refer to God, so I would understand if that is situationally-limited.

Is it that „ÄåÁ•ûÊßò„Äç is limited to just the sense "Lord God" (in other words, the manner of address to God)? Or is it indeed used to simply mean "God" (without the implication of a vocative)?

::No, I wasn't confused. But most other language terms that are used for God have a specific sense to indicate as much. For example: ''[[‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§®]]'', ''[[·É¶·Éõ·Éî·É†·Éó·Éò]]'', ''[[‡∞¶‡±á‡∞µ‡±Å‡∞°‡±Å]]''. I think that it would probably make sense to have a similar sense in our entry for „ÄåÁ•ûÊßò„Äç.

::: Meh, I think the big-G "God" sense is already covered by sense #1.  I see that some other languages' entries have a proper noun listed, but I don't think the Japanese term is ever treated as a proper noun, so that approach would be inappropriate here.  Monolingual JA sources also don't split out the big-G "God" sense from the "honorific term for any god or deity" sense.  A brief survey of bilingual dictionaries suggests a similar approach.
::: I personally don't see a need, but if others do, how about just adding big-G "God" to the line for sense #1, like {{diff|61242271|text=this}}?  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 18:14, 3 December 2020 (UTC)

::::: @[[User:Tharthan|Tharthan]]: What constitutes a "proper noun" per se in Japanese is something of a slippery concept.  The language doesn't decline nouns, nor does it have any grammatical gender or number, nor are there any cases or conjugation specific to proper nouns.  In our entries so far, just from my own subjective experience, it seems that "proper nouns" are mainly the names of specific singular things, where there's a strong sense of name-ness.  {{m|en|Russian}} or {{m|en|Harold}} in English are identifiable as names of specific things, whereas {{m|en|country}} or {{m|en|dog}} are not.  Big-G {{m|en|God}} is identifiable as a proper noun by its capitalization and its use as a name, with corresponding specific syntax that help distinguish it from small-g {{m|en|god}} (I think mostly differences in article usage).  Japanese has neither capitalization nor differences in syntax to differentiate the two.
::::: If others feel that the concept of the Abrahamic big-G "God" is sufficiently proper-noun-y across languages, I have no particular opposition to splitting the corresponding sense out to a <code>===Proper noun===</code> section in the {{cog|ja|Á•ûÊßò}} entry.  ‚Äë‚Äë&nbsp;[[User:Eirikr|Eir√≠kr&nbsp;√ötlendi]]&nbsp;‚îÇ<sup>''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;vi√∞&nbsp;mig]]''</sup> 22:51, 3 December 2020 (UTC)

That's what I mean by "real subject", a term which is also used by the TLFi ("sujet r√©el"; see its entry for {{m|fr|pleuvoir}}). In support of this idea is the fact that ''pleuvoir'' can be used non-impersonally (albeit with a figurative meaning): "Les balles pleuvent." (// "Il pleut des balles."); "Les diamants vont pleuvoir et les perles neiger."
:::::::: About your second point: yes. See also "je n'en sais trop rien" = "I'm none too sure", "I'm not quite sure", "I don't know".

Is there any case of "citrous X" where properly the word has to be "citrous", making a point of distinction, rather than the definition of "citrous" being "old or rare form of ''citrus'' (adj.)"?

== Quotation under nehmen (German) ==

The quotation "Hierauf nehmen sie des Getr√§nks [...]," under definition one of {{l|de|nehmen}} seems problematic in a couple of ways. First, the full cite is 50 words long which seems excessive for a 5 word quote. I'm not sure that such a short, and not particularly memorable quote even needs a cite.

Second, but more importantly, the quote is from the 18th century and uses language that I would consider dated at best, possibly obsolete. (Perhaps a native speaker can confirm this.) My literal translation is something like "Hereupon they took of the drink", which sounds strange in English but I'm pretty certain that the German is just as odd to modern ears. (If you want to get into specifics, the "hierauf" (hereupon) is unusual but still normal in German, but the genitive "des Getr√§nks" is simply not used in this way anymore.) I tempted to just remove it since it's not a good example of how you would use the word in the 21st century. But it might work as quotation for some obsolete/archaic meaning that I'm not qualified to add. That's assuming you don't care about the first issue.

Anyway, the entry is sort of a work in progress at the moment; I added about a dozen light verb constructions but I don't think there's a consensus on how to best handle them. (I mentioned this here about a week ago.) For now I'm (mis)using the uxi template to list the phrases and translations.

::: By the literal meaning of [[in vain]], something held in vain would be something held that does no good, that will ultimately lead to nothing. Either that, or it might mean something held to be in vain. There also might be an allusion to the biblical commandment: "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain", and another biblical quote: "vanity of vanities; all is vanity." Perhaps the second example is meant to evoke a paradoxical combination of positive biblical sayings from the {{w|Beatitudes}}, with the moral condemnation of human failure implied by the two quotes I gave above.

Use other dictionaries as a reference for meanings, grammar, etc., but not as include/exclude criteria since we have our own.

However, examples of the latter type can surely be constructed along the same lines. E.g. "The train supposed to arrive at six o'clock never came". I'm not sure that this in itself is a compelling reason to move the entry to "supposed to", as this kind of ellipsis, in this case of "that was", is a regular feature of English, and you could say that the "be" verb is still "somehow present". Even so, I would support moving the entry back to "supposed to" on "aesthetic" grounds even if we can't find good non-"be" copular examples. Also noting that the move to "be supposed to" has not been properly completed, as most of the definitions, as well as the bold highlighting in the examples, do not include the "be" verb.

== when words are interchangeable but senses are usually spelled one way or the other ==

# Sometimes, similar words are confused often and either can be used to mean anything the other can, but certain senses are mostly spelled one way (the way they originally were), and others another. [[egoism|Egoism]]/[[egoist]]/etc vs [[egotism]]/[[egotist]]/etc may be examples of this. 
# Sometimes, one word is spelled various ways, and senses occur mostly or exclusively in one spelling: e.g. "whip" (''n.'') is more often ''[[blacksnake]]'', and the verb is (almost?) exclusively ''[[blacksnake]]'', but serpents are more often ''[[black snake]]s''. 
# Relatedly, sometimes, a word splits into (partially) separate words: e.g. ''[[besagew]]'' refers to underarm armor, while ''[[besague]]'' refers to various kinds of armor, including underarm armor (as well as to a wide variety of weapons, the original sense).
How should this be handled? Currently, I left the different senses of ''[[egoism]]'' vs ''[[egotism]]'' (and the other pairs of words) on their different pages, with sense lines crosslinking the two, which is also how other e.g. Dictionary.com does it, but this has been pointed out to be confusing / circular-seeming. One alternative would be to consolidate all the senses on one page, and have a usage note explain that some are mostly and were originally spelled one way and some the other way, but this feels 'wrong', to conflate different words. Another idea would be to forgo having a ''definition-line'' convering the use of each one to mean the other, and just leave the "original" senses of each to their own spelling, and have usage notes say "Can also be used with all the senses of [the other word]"; but we normally cover senses via sense lines rather than usage notes. (For ''besagew'', besides the approach the entries currently take, another idea would be to define ''[[besagew]]'' as "a ''[[besague]]'' protecting the underarm", but the current approach seems better.)

:: I don't have anything to say about how to handle this, but examples include [[enquiry]] and [[inquiry]], the latter in England being more an official inquiry. You could also bring in [[nought]] (= zero) and [[naught]] (=nothing), spellings that are frequently confused by native speakers. My sense from reading Tea room is that this dictionary is a descriptive and not a prescriptive dictionary, and so words confused by native speakers have to be accepted as such. There may be other words similarly confused. [[glister]] and [[glitter]]? These are etymologically identical, but ''all that glisters is not gold'' should have [[glister]], although I hear younger native speakers saying [[glitter]] here as previous distinctions recede from the spoken language. *** Just had a thought: maybe these should be tagged as "doublets", if there is such a tag?

:::Perhaps the most common example is [[effect]] vs. [[affect]]. I think the usage note under "affect" handles this kind of thing pretty well, though I would make it a bit more obvious in "effect" that the full explanation is given under "affect". (Perhaps template:affect-effect so the same note can be in both places at once.) There is something to be said for being non-prescriptive, but it should at least be noted which usage is considered standard. I'm pretty sure if someone used "affect" instead of "effect" in a resume for a management position it would get tossed right away, and I imagine a hapless job-seeker being confused why: "I looked up on Wiktionary and it said I could use either one." In the olden days, way back in the 20th century, copy editors would catch this kind of thing and fix it before it ever saw print. I guess nowadays automated grammar checkers can do that kind of thing, but they don't always get it right. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 06:22, 8 December 2020 (UTC)

::::: Mihia, the concept of "incorrectness" is no longer so firmly held in linguistics. At least in Western countries, I find that most academics no longer believe that the way that large numbers of native speakers speak or write can be regarded as arbitrarily incorrect. You have to at least say that the "standards" are arbitrary and are largely social/cultural constructs, but within the context of those, then certain spellings will be regarded by many/most as incorrect. This is not the same thing as saying they are incorrect as such, which is a metaphysical concept. Descriptivism isn't a nonsense: languages evolve, and even the prescriptive standards do eventually shift in line with the observed reality of the language as it is used.

::::::Of course, ultimately what is "correct" and "incorrect" in a language is an arbitrary convention. However, we are trying, I would hope, to produce a practically useful dictionary. If we took a purely descriptive approach then we would list "affect" as "Alternative form of effect" and vice versa, on the basis that lots of people use the words that way. I hope and trust that no one supports doing that. Descriptivism in dictionaries works fine until one hits a common usage that everyone knows is wrong, and then it is exposed.

:::::::: Where there is legitimate debate, yes, it is fine to report that, but for cases that are definitely incorrect, reporting this as an opinion of other people would be tiresomely weasly and feeble. For example, if you look at ''[[effect]]'', which presently reads "Do not confuse with ''affect''", that would need to be changed to e.g. "Some commentators warn against confusing 'effect' with 'affect'", or something like that.

If (a significant number of) people think that [[definately]], or [[-ise]] or [[color]] is spelled correctly, then we should note that fact.

:::::::::: No, I don't disagree with distinguishing [[affect]] and [[effect]]. I merely replied to the comment that "descriptivism is nonsense". Descriptivism is not nonsense, because prescribed standards cannot move too far out of synch with an evolving language or else they'd lose their authority. Prescriptive standards move more slowly, but they do move, because the language as it is observed in real life must win out in the end. If 99% of people no longer differentiated between affect and effect, you would have to accept the distinction had been lost. [[Special:Contributions/81.141.8.102|81.141.8.102]] 09:12, 16 December 2020 (UTC)
::::::::::: First of all, you seem to not realise/recognise that prevailing shifts can be undone in certain rare circumstances. For example, if 99% of people didn't distinguish "whose" from "who's" in spelling, but the 1% that did comprised most of academia, and academia ended up having a potent influence on the following generation, then the shift could be undone/reversed. Same thing with sound mergers. There have been prevailing trends towards the merger of certain sounds <small>(the nearest to this kind of thing that comes to mind with regard to English would be a once historical trend towards merging (what would now be pronounced) /…î…™/ with /a…™/)</small> in languages throughout history that have ended up being undone in the end, even though there would have been people like yourself saying at one point in that time ''"this is no longer nonstandard"'' or whatever. Fifty years later, lo and behold, the person claiming "this is no longer nonstandard" would be told by the young people of that time (just as he had been told by the old folks fifty years prior) that he is incorrect, and that ''it'' most certainly is nonstandard. So, word to wise, don't ever be so certain that just because 75% or 99% or anything less than 100% of people are moving in one trend that that necessarily means that a historical distinction no longer will exist going forward/be considered the correct understanding, or that a historically nonstandard pronunciation will for certain be considered quite standard in the future.
::::::::::: Moreover, there are can also come a point when a language has altered enough over time that the usage of one 'form' of a language cannot be properly considered usage of another. For instance, usage of Modern English could not be considered usage / neo-usage of Early Modern English unless it complied grammatically and spelling-wise with the standards of Early Modern English, in which case many may (consequently) not consider it an example of today's Modern English. Moreover, if 99% of people opted to spelt words completely phonetically, used an incredible basic almost creole or pidgin-like form of English grammar, and also had fifty different mergers that are not recognised as standard in today's Modern English, then a case might be able to be made that such individuals are not using the same English as we are, but instead are using something else that developed out of (today's) Modern English.
::::::::::: I would say that descriptivism is no more absurd than prescriptivism, but that the reverse is also true. Moreover, there are zealots of both schools of thought. With that said, Wiktionary is a descriptivistic dictionary, so we have to keep that in mind when we add usage notes/descriptor tags to entries/parts of entries.

== [[ÂÄü„Çä„Çã]] (Is it "indebt self/make self owe (something)" instead of "borrow"?) ==

I've come across the example sentence ''„ÄåÂΩº„Å´„Éì„Éá„Ç™„ÇíÂÄü„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç'' with the translation ''"I borrowed a video from him."'' for the verb ''„ÄåÂÄü„Çä„Çã„Äç - "borrow"''.<br>
(My first intuition a few months back was that something about that doesn't seem to make sense, but I'm better off not spending much time on this for now as there are many things about the grammar in Japanese I don't really understand yet, so maybe I'll just "get it" once I'm versed enough.)<br>
But I'm still torn between (ordered by likeliness):
# It's used in this kind of sentence similarly to „ÄåËøî„Åô„Äç, giving the opposite effect. (And the idea is something like ''"I indebted myself '''<u>to him</u>''' (by) borrowing a video."'')
# I don't understand „Äå„Å´„Äç (or something else in the syntax) and the grammar works differently to ''„ÄåÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®„Å´Êú¨„ÇíËøî„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç''.
# There's a mistake in the examples.

Is ''„ÄåÂΩº'''<u>„Åã„Çâ</u>'''„Éì„Éá„Ç™„ÇíÂÄü„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç'' broken grammar? (''"I indebt myself from him..." (sic)'')

Another example sentence ''„ÄåÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®„ÅßÊñôÁêÜ„ÅÆÊú¨„ÇíÂÄü„Çä„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç - "I borrowed a cookbook from the library."'' didn't really help as there's no difference whether it's "indebt self" or "borrow". (I parse it something like ''"A cookbook was borrowed at the library (by [subject])."''. But now I think it might as well be ''"[Subject] made self owe a cookbook by using the library."'').

== Second person imperative of [[entschuldigen]] (German) ==

The conjugation table under [[entschuldigen#Conjugation]] gives "entschuldig (du)" and "entschuldige (du)" as possible imperative forms. But my understanding is that the "-e" is required, as it is for any verb ending with "-igen". Is this true? And if so can the table be corrected? --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 04:12, 9 December 2020 (UTC)
: I don‚Äôt think it true that it is required (who says so?), I have never heard of such a rule, but that -e-less imperative is less often and at best less expected and hardly colloquial or poetic. You find high register religious uses ‚Äúpeinig mich‚Äù. Google results of ‚Äúbeleidig mich nicht‚Äù are about ‚Öï to ‚Äúbeleidige mich nicht‚Äù. But somehow all verbs ending in -ige are rare in the imperative, e.g. ‚Äúentschuldigen‚Äù would be used in polite situations so in the plural with {{m|de|Sie}} anyway. But it is not wrong to treat these verbs as exceptions. [http://www.lerngrammatik.de/regeln_verb_imperativ_1.htm Other exceptions] listed I do not grasp. ‚Äúverbesser‚Äù, ‚Äúfange‚Äù, ‚Äúwerd‚Äù are {{m|de|unauff√§llig}}, depending somewhat on the region or colloquialness but mostly altogether, ‚Äúhabe‚Äú is well-known.

::I'm getting the -e required rule from [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deutsch/Grammatik/Imperative/Imperativ.html A Review of German Grammar by Bruce Duncan]. I'll try to check some other grammars, but the one you linked to has pretty much the same rule. (I not convinced that the site you linked to is correct about "verbessern" being an exception. The thing with "fangen" is that the "drop the -st" rule that they mention doesn't work when you add an umlaut in the second person present tense. So it's "Fang!" rather than "F√§ng!" as you might think. A much more common application of this exception is "Lauf!" I hear this a lot in TV shows when something scary appears.) It doesn't say why in either place but I'm guessing the reasoning behind the rule is that ending in "-ig" would create a soft g (IPA √ß) sound and make the word sound like an adjective. But perhaps that's not as much of a problem in some dialects. "Beleidigen mich nicht" is a good test case, but my Google results show 10,800 for ‚Äúbeleidige mich nicht‚Äù and 193 for ‚Äúbeleidig mich nicht‚Äù so I think the ratio is more like 1/50, which I think is small enough that random misspellings and people who aren't fluent in the language can account for it. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 14:18, 9 December 2020 (UTC)
:::I've checked a few more grammars and the exact rule seems to be a matter of opinion, so I guess it comes down to who you trust more.

This development is the reason why these verbs may or may not have the -e in the imperative singular, pursuant to the general rule, but other verbs like {{m|de|helfen}} and {{m|de|essen}} must omit it. It is deplorable how many grammars, supposing that they thus load learners less, make things avoidably complicated by omitting the historical layers. The only good grammar is a historical grammar.

== [[from me born]] (redux) ==

The Paderborn IP has placed an RFC for the Jamaican Creole entry on the talk page with the comment: "1. The language of the cites in the Jamaican Creole section are English and not Jamaican. 2. The 1975 cite of V. Rubin and L. Comitas (Jamaican Creole section) and the 1976 quote by the the same (English section) have a similar title ("Ganja in Jamaica") and similar strucutre, hence it's obviously the same language."<br>Disclosure: I've previously closed the [[Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification/Non-English#from_me_born|RFV of ''from me born'']]. I disagree with the IP's claim that both cites are exclusively in English, I would contend that the sentence in which the phrase is used is Jamaican Creole. But the second point is valid, ''Ganja in Jamaica'' by Vera D. Rubin, Lambros Comitas is cited twice in perhaps slightly different editions for different languages, which I didn't notice at the time. So it should probably be decided for which language this cite should be used.<br>Now my argument would be that the use of ''me'' as a subject pronoun and ''social'' as a predicate without a copula is more typical of Creole grammar, so that the quote is Jamaican Creole, even though the additional context before and after is without question English. I have added additional quotes from newspapers that I consider to mostly use English grammar to the English section so that its attestion is not in question; [https://edm.com/interviews/charly-black-diggy-dee-interview here] is another (perhaps non-durable) use in an English context; if necessary additional Jamaican Creole quotations can.

::: It depends on what you mean with "ambiguous". Like most English-based creoles that also have English as an official national language, Jamaican Creole has undergone a degree of decreolisation so there's a continuum between Jamaican Creole and a more standard variety of English, with a lot of code-switching and other forms of mutual influence between the two. So in that sense many cites are going to be ambiguous. But in this case the IP for instance seems to have a narrower conception of what I would consider Creole; I don't think the IP and I are going to agree on a working definition of what's unambiguously Jamaican Creole. <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  20:14, 9 December 2020 (UTC)

:::"Christian Church. ''An unmarried or chaste maiden or woman, distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and regarded as having a special place among the members of the Christian church on account of these merits.''
:::<small>Chiefly used with reference to early Christian times.</small>"

::The OED gives numerous citations (in recognizable English, of course), from the 13th century and onward. Does that not qualify as "early", {{ping|Fay Freak}}? The qualification is to distinguish it from the contemporary Church.

::This definition differs from "consecrated virgin" insofar as it does not involve a rite of consecration. I might note that the OED does define "consecrated virgin" on its own, without calling it a synonym of this sense of "virgin".

::Merriam Webster includes [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virgin a similar, though shorter definition], which I can link to: "An unmarried woman devoted to religion".

::As for distinctness from the main definition, for what it's worth, I originally tried to simply broaden the main definition to note that "virgin" often has the specific connotation of "female". An editor reverted me, so, not wanting to get into an extended argument, I instead added a more narrow sense where that connotation was a specific part of it.

:::: {{ping|Fay Freak}}, is it really necessary to gratuitously insult people's religious beliefs ("crucified sophist") in a Wiktionary post?
:::: {{ping|JudahH}} As far as whether or not it's accurate to reduce this to a synonym of "consecrated virgin," I think the {{w|Virgin (title)|historical evidence}} suggests that it is. The order of virgins in the early Christian Church developed from the practice of young women privately committing themselves to virginity, and sometimes suffering martyrdom as a direct or indirect result. The fact that they were often pious has little to do with the actual meaning of the word, and they were not virgins in a separate, "unmarried" sense, but simply in the ordinary sense. Being noted for piety was not what made them a virgin. Virginity, and the promise to keep that virginity, made them a virgin. The OED's inclusion of the "piety" and "steadfastness in religion" criteria doesn't mean much. Major reference works often misrepresent concepts in Christianity. Is there lexical evidence that being "unmarried" (apart from the question of sex) and "piety" have anything to do with the actual meaning of the word?

::::Do you then also lend orthographic support to this resolution by writing ''learnt''&nbsp;? &nbsp;--[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]] 18:17, 13 December 2020 (UTC)
:::::I'm not going to pretend that all English people agree as to usage. I write ''learnt''. As for pronunciation, I pronounce it ''learnt'' whether written 'learned' or 'learnt', but I think younger speakers of British English are adopting a more mid-Atlantic approach that may be the kernel of a future more unified English language, and so some English people do have 'learned', even in pronunciation. I normally turn to Daniel Jones' Pronouncing Dictionary. He was a professor of English and a noted expert on pronunciation, especially of the RP variety, before WWII. His entry for ''learn'' (and I'm looking at a PDF of the 1917 edition) shows that ''learnt'' is pronounced 'learnt', and that the variant spelling ''learned'' may be pronounced either 'learned' or 'learnt'. So you can still pronounce it with a -t whatever the spelling. The same goes for dreamed/dreamt, leaned/leant, burned/burnt, spelled/spelt and basically any others.

== [[staniel]], [[stannel]], [[stonegall]] ==

Our apparent 'main' entry for the forms of this term has no qualifiers. However, Collins English Dictionary marks this term as archaic (it also gives a second sense that we don't have). Our entry for ''[[stannel]]'' marks that word as obsolete.

Is any form of this word in current general use? Is it archaic, or perhaps now limited to only  certain dialects? [[User:Tharthan|Tharthan]] ([[User talk:Tharthan|talk]]) 01:38, 12 December 2020 (UTC)
: Hi, I have never hard the word, and I doubt anyone not dealing regularly with kestrels has. The OED says under staniel/stannel: 

staniel, stannel
(Ààst√¶nj…ôl, Ààst√¶n…ôl)

OE. st√°ne·¥Åella, st√°n·¥Åella, lit. ‚Äòstone-yeller‚Äô f. st√°n stone n. + *·¥Åella agent-n. f. ·¥Åellan to yell (in OE. poetry used of the cry of the hawk). 
 
The corrupt form stallion (quot. 1601 in 1‚ÄÜŒ±) may have had dialectal currency; cf. the converse mispronunciation staniel for stallion, which is common in rustic speech. The spurious forms standgale, -gall, given in some recent dictionaries, are evolved from the etymologizing conjecture ‚Äòstand-in-gale‚Äô (Swainson, Prov. Names of Birds). The alleged Ger. synonym steingall, commonly cited by etymologists as cognate, is of doubtful genuineness. The 19th c. lexicographers seem to have obtained it, directly or indirectly, from the Vocabula of Peucer and Eber (1549). But although in this glossary the word is treated as German, its source appears to be William Turner's Avium Historia (Cologne 1544), where steingall is said to be the English word for tinnunculus. Turner's steingall prob. represents *stein·¥Åall; Gesner (1555) says that it is northern English. The English ornithologists of the 17th c., following Gesner, give steingall as an English name of the bird; Willughby's stone-gall is an etymologizing alteration of this.] [[Special:Contributions/81.141.8.102|81.141.8.102]] 13:43, 16 December 2020 (UTC)

== [[block]] ==

Currently one of the definitions at ''[[block]]'' reads:

:{{lb|en|nautical}} A [[case]] with one or more [[sheave]]s/[[pulley]]s, used with [[rope]]s to increase or redirect force, for example, as part of the [[rigging]] of a [[sailing]] [[ship]].

I'm unclear whether this truly is a separate nautical sense or is merely an application of the general sense that we find in e.g. ''[[block and tackle]]''. If there is a separate nautical sense then we should add the general sense and also modify the nautical sense to show how it is special. If not, I will just generalise the one sense that we do have. Any ideas anyone? [[User:Mihia|Mihia]] ([[User talk:Mihia|talk]]) 18:20, 12 December 2020 (UTC)

:As far as I can make out, a ''block and tackle'' always involves two blocks (or two sets of blocks): one fixed at the top, and the other moving with the load being lifted. These fixed and moving blocks appear to be called ''blocks'' also in non-nautical contexts,<sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzoDAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA209&dq=%22block+and+tackle%22&hl=en][https://books.google.com/books?id=CDECAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA215&dq=%22block+and+tackle%22&hl=en][https://books.google.com/books?id=0skJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA55&dq=%22block+and+tackle%22&hl=en]</sup> and we also find the term used other than as part of a block and tackle.<sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8Cl-itHZzMC&pg=PA211&dq=block&hl=en]</sup> A ''block'' is strictly speaking the (usually wooden) housing of the (usually metal) pulley wheel(s); it also has a hook or other fastener at the end opposite to where the rope runs.

== [[of color]] ==

In [//en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=of_color&type=revision&diff=61128447&oldid=61074300 diff], [[User:Struthious Bandersnatch]] added "<nowiki># {{lb|en|chiefly|US}} A [[mixed-race]] or [[multiheritage]] person</nowiki>" as a separate (and, as clarified on talk, modern / "2020") sense. I removed it for reasons given on talk, though in digging through other citations, dictionaries, encyclopedias and usage/history guides about the phrase (all of which give "nonwhite", "not white" or "not white-skinned" as the modern sense), I found and added a historical sense, tentatively worded as "<nowiki># {{lb|en|historical}} Belonging to a category of people with mixed black and white ancestry in the Americas in the 18th and early 19th centuries</nowiki>", by which "of color" ''did'' describe mixed-race people in a way contrasted with other (non-mixed-race) nonwhite people. <br/>However, Struthious has argued that a modern definition should also include "multi-racial Americans who consider themselves people of color, with white ancestry, and thus partly white". One thing I suggested that could accomplish this would be to change ~"nonwhite" to something along the lines of "nonwhite, or not entirely white", but I'm reluctant to do that because every other work I saw defines modern "of color" only as "nonwhite", and includes "partly white" people only implicitly / by considering them to be nonwhite (which seems to be the most common way that both those people themselves, and other people, consider them?). <br/>(I also asked a few friends of color, including one who has one black and one white parent, who considers herself biracial and Black and a woman of color; they felt "nonwhite" was a sufficient definition. Naturally, that's only a few people's anecdotal opinions, but it adds to the absence of anything supporting a broader def.) I realize thorny racial questions are everyone's favourite (/s), but, what do you think? [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 22:04, 12 December 2020 (UTC)
: Firstly, I feel that "of colour" is poor English, although from a descriptivist point of view has to be in a dictionary (i.e. that is how it is actually used). We don't call women "persons of gender", right? However, the Wiktionary entry does make clear that this usage may reflect French and/or Spanish influence on US English, thus explaining the origin of the phrase. As for the definition, the concept of someone being of colour implies that Western societies should, rightly or wrongly,  be conceptualised as the whites vs. all the rest. For this reason, people of partial white ancestry are held (by the activists who promote the term) to fall on the non-white side of the barricades. (It's not really relevant whether or not it is right to do this to a society, or whether there are long-term consequences that flow from doing so.) The very concept instructs biracial people that they are non-white. In fact, Wiktionary's definition of non-white could even be amended to make clear that even marginal non-white ancestry is held to count. I think the Wiktionary definition of "of colour" is perfectly acceptable as it is.[[Special:Contributions/81.141.8.102|81.141.8.102]] 01:09, 13 December 2020 (UTC)

: I understand ''of color'' to mean ''nonwhite'' with a hint of "I'm the kind of person who stays one step ahead on the euphemism treadmill."  ''Of color'' and ''nonwhite'' (to me) don't imply any particular test of racial purity.  Visibly dark-skinned descendants of American slaves with some white blood in them are considered nonwhite in America, despite being visibly paler than recent immigrants from Africa.  At some level of dilution maybe they cease being nonwhite.  Maybe.  I have read stories about American women passing as or identifying as black without any drops of blood to support that identity.  As I see it, their "of color-ness" stands or falls with their blackness rather than being based on a separate test.  Maybe people who use those words regularly have a different sense.

And a paper in ''Stanford University Publications: University series. Language and literature'' (1954), volumes 12-14, page 190, says: 
*: 1. *b√¶dan. At Ps. 78, 1 in the Canterbury Psalter <u>coinquinaverunt</u> is glossed <u>b√¶ddon</u>. From this gloss <u>HD</u> enters <u>b√¶dan</u>, 'to defile', and <u>HEW</u> enters <u>b«£dan</u>, 'beflecken', relating it to English <u>bad</u> and OE <u>b«£ddel</u>, 'hermaphrodite'. It is true that the lemma calls for a meaning 'to defile'; but since the glosses in this Psalter show a notoriously free hand in the attempt to interpret the Latin it is a rather risky source from which to postulate a word not documented elsewhere.
: This risk notwithstanding, the possibility of explaining otherwise more opaque words like {{m|ang|b√¶ddel}} (note the difference in length markers between our entry and the quote, in case that word also needs double-checking) has led some other authors to accept or at least mention the verb.

''badde'' may here be a pp. form (''grad'' (as in l. 3813): ''bad''), meaning "oppressed", "overpowered" (< OE ''b«£dan''), or possibly "defiled" (see Holthausen, ''b«£dan'' 2; CH gives a short vowel, ''b√¶dan'' = defile), the preceding ''to'' being used as a mere intensive, meaning "greatly", "excessively".

This word stands in all MSS. with the text of Psalterium Romanum, where those derived from Psalterium Gallicanum have ''polluerunt''. It may be that the verb ''coinquinare'' which we know to mean 'to defile' was not familiar to the scribe and that he played safe by substituting the relatively colourless term ''b√¶dan'' 'to afflict'.

:So, unless it's being [[fronted]], it comes after "'Opinion", "Size", "Age", and "Shape". It often comes after "Color", and in practice often comes after "Origin".

There is a tendency that "any final limiter" goes last ("a heinous new vehicular homicide"), but frankly "an ugly, ancient genocidal French newscaster" sounds as good or better to me than "an ugly, ancient French genocidal newscaster", and ditto for "gay", so again, I think words that don't fit into the categories don't obey the rules of how those categories are sequenced or necessarily stick to one spot in the sequence...

Our definition for the latter makes it seem near-synonymous (if not fully synonymous) with the former.

I notice, however, that slightly different definitions exist for the latter term in other sources. One such definition implies that the thief does not do anything to ''create'' a means of entrance for themselves (thus they, for example, do not pick locks, nor open unlocked windows).

need their translations merged. {{m|en|eggbeater}}¬†already refers to the page¬†{{m|en|eggwhisk}}, suggesting this is all indeed the same, but the glosses do not match. Evidently the gloss at {{m|en|eggbeater}} is wrong since it being used for ‚Äúa kitchen utensil that uses rotating blades to beat eggs‚Äù derives from the fact of the item in question being inserted in a rotating machine, but the item is otherwise typically stored separately and separately called the same. I believe we need to unify translations for the depicted item and this is what most editors adding translations translated, but some native speakers need to assess the scopes of application of the terms and possibly redefine them. {{m|en|beater}}¬†seems very weakly defined (‚ÄúA kitchen implement for mixing.‚Äù) and particularly I ask whether this term is particularly restricted to the items under [[c:Category:Whisks]]; it is possible that it means all kinds of instruments used for beating in the kitchen and then still we have to separate a meaning for this particular kind. Wikimedia Commons sorts the depicted implement under [[c:Category:Balloon whisks]] distinguishing by form which also suggests we need hyponym entries if the category names aren‚Äôt completely made up as they sometimes are, [[User:Fay Freak|Fay Freak]] ([[User talk:Fay Freak|talk]]) 02:31, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
: For me, an egg beater is hand-held implement that you insert into the mixture, with a crank on the side that makes the working parts spin while the implement as a whole remains stationary.

::: Yes, I think there are differences between some of these.

The image Chuck added is a manual ''egg beater'', and [[:File:Handheld_Electric_Beater.jpg|the image I just added]] is an electric ''egg beater'', and the parts on the bottom are the individual ''beaters''. Electric egg beaters often come with both beater/mixer and whisk attachments (and a "bread hook"), which are distinct. "Eggwhisk'' / ''egg whisk" sounds like just a redundant way of saying "whisk"; Google Image search results for "egg whisk" mostly look the same as "whisk"; only when other words are added like "electric egg whisk" do I get images that look like electric egg beaters, but "electric egg whisk" is not a common name, [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electric+egg+beater%2C+electric+egg+whisk&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Celectric%20egg%20beater%3B%2Cc0 too rarely for Ngrams to plot]. I think ''eggwhisk'' could probably just be defined as a synonym of the kitchen-utensil sense of ''whisk'', and those translations could be merged, unless I'm missing something.

:I edited the entries to no longer claim that ''eggbeater'' and ''eggwhisk'' are synonyms. We could probably drop the translations at ''eggwhisk'', because they seem to all be for ''whisk'' or for ''whisk'' + ''for eggs'', which seems SOPpy and also mistaken because the top Google Books results for "with an eggwhisk" and "with an egg whisk" are for whisking cream, sauces, etc, suggesting that ''eggwhisk'' just means ''whisk'' without even being specifically for eggs. (''Egg whisk'' is also a more common spelling, if someone wants to move the entry.) I also updated ''whisk'' to mention that they were formerly (and marginally still are) made of twigs, not just wire. Regarding ''beater'': it seems to be simultaneously too broad and too narrow; Dictionary.com has both an analogue of our sense 1 and a quasi-analogue of our sense 2, except that their usexes (about rug beaters) point out that it's not limited to kitchen implements; conversely, Merriam-Webster has very specific definitions of ''beater'', and a curiously broad-seeming definition of ''eggbeater'', saying "especially" a rotary device as if it actually ''could be'' also just a ''whisk''(?)...

== Diegesis - broader use? ==

"Diegesis" is defined on here only as a narrative story, in contrast to mimesis. The page for "diegetic" expands to also include its relation to film music (where "diegetic" refers to sound elements that characters in the story can hear), but I've heard it in much broader terms than that. Would it be apt to add a definition of "diegesis" to the effect of "the extent of elements of a story which directly affect the narrative, esp. when explicitly known by the characters"? That's about as well as I can put it into words, but if anyone can find a better, more reputable definition, it might be nice to add it there.

[That definition might sound a bit overly specific (and maybe it is), but on the Wikipedia page for Diegesis, there are examples of elements which are considered diegetic in that they affect the narrative storyline, but aren't explicitly known by the characters - for example, a video game could have diegetic music that the characters react to (making it, specifically, intra-diegetic); diegetic sound effects like an alarm which affects story elements but which the characters don't directly react to (the main thing I'm talking about, which is extra-diegesis); and non-diegetic elements like the control scheme for the actual controller. I feel like the clause after "especially" makes that distinction clear, but it might be unnecessary or better expressed some other way.]

There are the same grammatical issues as with another definition, for which I added a long usage note a few months ago, so now there are two usage notes.

So I have two questions; first, what is the best way to handle these tricky grammar issues when they span multiple, but not all, definitions? Second, what can be done so that people can actually find this information?

== [[nd√´rroj]] has PIE root *an-2 ==

I just looked at the etymmology of Albanian nd√´rroj "change", and the PIE root behind it appears to be *an-2. Now, I don't recall 2 being a valid PIE letter aside from subscript 2 in h<sub>2</sub>, so‚Ä¶ what was this 2 supposed to mean? *d<sup>w</sup>√≥h<sub>1</sub> meaning "two"? Looking at the edit history, the first revision this *an-2 appears in is by MewBot on 28/5/14, but previous revisions back up to 3/8/13 (revision by MewBot again) had something hidden under a "Template:term/t" error, and all previous revisions up to the new entry creation on 6/2/13 had a "Template:recons" error, so I'm not sure if the bot added it or just fixed (perhaps incorrectly) some code flaw. [[User:MGorrone|MGorrone]] ([[User talk:MGorrone|talk]]) 17:38, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
:{{re|MGorrone}} Those errors are caused because the templates {{tl|term/t}} and {{tl|recons}} have been deleted; at the time of the edits you're looking at they were being used correctly. So when you look at the older history of pages, you often have to click "Edit" to see the source code in order to bypass such template errors. In this case, we see that it was the first editor of the page, [[User:Etimo|Etimo]], who wrote <code><nowiki>From {{etyl|sqj-pro|sq}} {{recons|anteros|lang=sqj-pro}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|sq}} {{recons|an-2|lang=ine-pro}} 'there, on the other side'.</nowiki></code> I suspect that this "an-2" comes from a dictionary (maybe Pokorny?) that has multiple entries for "an-", and it's entry number 2 that means "there, on the other side". Of course, that's not how we do things here.

== (geen) volle zalen trekken / nee, jij trekt volle zalen ==

In Dutch there is the expression ''volle zalen trekken'' that more or less means "to be popular, to be of outstanding quality (e.g. good-looking, a great performer, etc.)" but it is almost exclusively used either with a negation (''geen volle zalen trekken'') or sarcastically, as in the rejoinder ''nee, jij trekt volle zalen'' (see {{BGC|nee, jij trekt volle zalen}}). I am inclined to lemmatise it at ''volle zalen trekken'' and indicate the way it is used via usage notes, but I thought I'd invite some input before creating it. I would specially like to know whether you think it is desirable to have hard redirects from ''geen volle zalen trekken'' and ''nee, jij trekt volle zalen'' or whether you would prefer a different definition. {{ping|Lambiam|Alexis Jazz|Rua|Thadh|Mnemosientje|Morgengave}} <br>Beside the above, ''volle zalen trekken'' is also used literally for attracting crowds so one performs for sold-out venues. <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  18:09, 19 December 2020 (UTC)

== [[double]] and [[double as]] ==

Regarding sense 9 of [[double]]:

9. ([[Appendix:Glossary#intransitive|intransitive]]) (often followed by [[as]]) To play a second part or serve a second [[role]].
:''A spork is a kind of fork that '''doubles''' as a spoon.''

I'm querying the word "often" in this definition. Can something "double as" something without the "as"? Are we then saying that the example could also work as:
:''A spork is a kind of fork that '''doubles''' a spoon.''

I think the word the definition needs is "always". What do you think? &mdash; [[User:Dentonius|Dentonius]] 02:03, 20 December 2020 (UTC)

:My feeling is that usage without ''as'' would've existed at least in the past, but it's hard to search for: there's too much chaff to easily search for examples of e.g. "which doubles a"; ''Century'' and Dictionary.com don't admit that any sense like this exists at all (with or without ''as''); Merriam-Webster has "to serve an additional purpose or perform an additional duty" but without any usexes or indications about ''as''; and the 1933 OED only has "To double a part: to act as the double of or substitute for (another player); to play two parts in the same piece; also fig." with cites like "she attempted to double the part of her mother" and "Lafor√™t [...] doubles Lainez". This last sense seems to be what our "(intransitive) (followed by for) To act as substitute" sense is aiming to cover(?), but it clearly isn't always followed by ''for''. (That sense should be moved next to the "play a second part" sense, if not folded into it.) [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 08:11, 20 December 2020 (UTC)

::: I see two types of phrasal verbs in a broad sense.  Compare {{m|en|blow up}}, which need not have any grammatical object, with ''double as'', which can be analyzed as an intransitive verb with a mandatory indirect object and a prescribed preposition.  We customarily define the first kind as a separate term.  The second kind can be defined as a verb sense using {{tl|indtr}}.  It's not mandatory in all cases, perhaps, but the template is there for a reason. [[User:Vox Sciurorum|Vox Sciurorum]] ([[User talk:Vox Sciurorum|talk]]) 15:16, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
:::: What about [[put in]], [[look after]], [[run into]], ...? There are phrasal verbs with adverbs and prepositions. Those arguing that [[double as]] is simply [[double]] + [[as]] are wrong because the meaning of [[double as]] exists neither in [[double]] nor in [[as]]. Combining the two gives rise to an idiomatic sense. Tucking away "double as" under "double" is dishonest. Whoever came up with the definition and put "often" was smart enough to know that indicating "always" would beg the question. &mdash; [[User:Dentonius|Dentonius]] 15:41, 20 December 2020 (UTC)

::::::There are several possibilities, with the above exhibiting most of them in different meanings.
::::::#The verb and preposition have their normal meanings and it's not a propositional verb at all. It seems these are sometimes included in the entry and sometimes not. In this case the direct object (if any) goes between the verb and the preposition and the preposition must be followed by a noun: "I put the food in my mouth." "He ran into the building."
::::::#The verb takes on a new meaning when combined with a prepositional phrase of a certain type. This has the same grammar as the previous case, just a different meaning, though you can often tell because the combination in question would not otherwise make sense: "He ran into a tree." "He ran the car into a tree." 
::::::#The verb and preposition form a new verb. There doesn't have to be a noun after the preposition, but the preposition can move around within the clause: "Just put in the key." "Just put the key in."
::::::There might be other possibilities as well but I think that covers the definitions in the three phrases given above. I don't think the first possibility requires a separate definition, much less a separate entry, but a definition might be useful for clarity if the entry already exists (as in "ran into") The second possibility should at least have a separate definition under the verb if not a separate entry. The third possibility should have a separate entry. By these criteria I think the original question should be into which category the phrase "double as" falls. The third one excluded because the preposition must come before the noun; "A spork is a kind of fork that doubles a spoon as," is incorrect grammar. The first possibility is eliminated because the the verb and proposition combination does not make sense otherwise (except in the theatrical sense). So it's the second possibilty and there is precedent both for keeping as a definition under "double", and for making it a separate entry. It looks to me like the issue can be resolved by removing "usually" from the label. I don't think a new entry is needed but I don't think it would do that much harm it someone created one. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 20:14, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
::::::: Here's a comment of mine from somewhere else on this site: If we had to choose one of those words to house the meaning of [[double as]], I'd say [[as]] houses more of that meaning, and not [[double]].

The resulting phrasal verbs are idiomatic (and, of course, synonymous). &mdash; [[User:Dentonius|Dentonius]] 20:19, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
::::::::I see your point but there doesn't seem to a definition of "double" that would go with this this usage of "as". Outside some specialized uses, "double" means to increase in size or to form a duplicate somehow. So the literal meaning of the example would be that the spork gets twice as big when you think of it as a spoon. In contrast, in the phrase "act as", there is a meaning of act that can be put together with this usage of "as" so that together the meaning is close to the the meaning of the whole expression. I agree that in "double as", the "as" meaning is covered under "as", but the "double" part does change meaning in the combination. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 22:02, 22 December 2020 (UTC)

{{outdent}} Late to this party, but I would just like to point out here the following interesting facts related to this topic: 
* This activity relates to the general pattern of pairs of ''[root] + -ic acid'' and ''[root] + {{m|en|-ate}}''‚Äîthe pattern by which {{w|weak acid|weak acids}} are generally named, and because such an acid's {{w|conjugate acid}} and {{w|conjugate base|conjugate base}} always ''{{w|acid dissociation constant|coexist}}'' in solution, the curious linguistic effect exists whereby the ''[root] + -ic acid'' and ''[root] + -ate'' terms are often viewed as "different names for the same thing" (in other words, synonymous), which is entirely reasonable/logical etically, even though from a certain other reasonable view, they are names for "different things" (an acid and a base, respectively). This is why biochemically knowledgeable people generally think "[[same difference]]" regarding, for example, {{w|folic acid|folic acid and folate}}. For the same reason, it drives "same difference" correlations across INNs and USANs and BANs and JANs in {{w|drug nomenclature}}, whereby for example aledronate and aledronic acid = "same thing", zoledronate and zoledronic acid = "same thing", and so on. 
* And therefore, it is {{w|natural language|natural}} that speakers of English can have the notion that "''[[-ic acid]]'' is thus 'just as much a suffix as {{m|en|-ate}} is'", even though there is an (orthographically artifactual) barrier in {{w|English orthography}} to viewing it that way emically. But it must be pointed out that the artifactual emic barrier does not represent an etic barrier, just as the ''orthographic'' rules of {{w|compound noun|noun compounding}} in (modern normative) {{w|English orthography}} differ from those in (modern normative) {{w|German orthography}} more than the corresponding ''morphologic'' rules differ. That difference-between-differences is artifactual albeit real, and real albeit artifactual. In other words, there are many compound nouns that are cognate across English and German that are "one word" in German but "not one word" in English, and this difference is artifactual albeit real, and real albeit artifactual. 
* Relatedly, I will leave you with one last mind-bend: descriptively, it is a (corpus-attested) fact that {{m|en|hyperlacticacidemia}}, styled solid, is a "real word" in biomedical English even though {{m|en|hyperlacticemia}} is the orthographically acceptable/normative synonym thereof. What we see here is an exploration of the boundary cases of how orthography places bounds on morphology when a population of speakers has high literacy rates, even though morphology is an older, more powerful force in language that predates normative orthography. 
* All of the above is NOT to say that ''[[-ic acid]]'' should be viewed as ''prescriptively acceptable as being a suffix'' in English metalanguage or in the emic views of how English speakers conceive that English morphology works. It is merely to say that there is a morphologic undertow in the common threads of Germanic-language compounding‚Äîwith morphology predating normative orthography‚Äîthat is trying to treat it as one, and that fact is interesting. A related corollary is that although many people are familiar with the theme that non-{{w|phonemic orthography|phonemic}} aspects of spelling are artifactual aspects of orthography, they are less often conscious of the way that {{w|word boundary|word boundaries}} are themselves also to some extent artifactual aspects of orthography whose artifactual quirks can differ across various cognate languages' respective normative orthographies.

== Predicative use of [[key]]? ==

We all speak different types of English - our idiolects -- and I think the fact that there are generational changes in English is also relevant. I'm always surprised to see ''key'' used predicatively. "It will be a key issue in the election campaign" sounds fine to me. "This issue will be key in the election" does not. I wonder if there are regional/social or other variations in use of this word. I think there are many people in English who prefer to use this adjective attributively only.

::Nouns (eg, ''key'', ''cookie-cutter'', ''blanket'') used attributively sufficiently often are likely to come to be used as predicates.

::: What phrases could we search for (that are common enough to meet Ngrams' threshold for plotting) to find only predicative uses of ''cookie-cutter''? When something is key, you can often enough say it's key ''to'' something else that phrases like "which are key to" (which I used above) can be used to find only predicative use. (Just searching for "which are key" without "to" would also match "which are key issues".) I tried "are cookie-cutter in" (thinking of e.g. "the houses are cookie-cutter in style") but it's too rare, ditto "is cookie-cutter in". The [//books.google.com/ngrams/info documentation] says Ngram Viewer supports searching for the end of a sentence (_END_), but I either did it wrong or "is cookie-cutter _END_" is too rare to be plotted. The Ngrams of "is cookie-cutter" and "are cookie-cutter" [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=is+cookie-cutter%2C+are+cookie-cutter&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cis%20cookie%20-%20cutter%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Care%20cookie%20-%20cutter%3B%2Cc0 look like this], but this could conceivably also be matching non-predicative use like "his proposal is cookie-cutter houses for the poor".

:::: Sche, if you choose American English or British English from the drop down Ngram menu, you see that predicative use of ''key'' took off in America as you said in the 1960s-1970s, and in the UK in the 1990s-2000s. So it seems younger native speakers of British English are speaking a more mid-Atlantic dialect. When I worked as a subeditor for a publishing house (publishing on global politics and economics), the house style was to strip out predicative ''key'', but it seemed to become harder and harder for the company to hire young subeditors who grasped the house style quickly.[[Special:Contributions/86.144.23.105|86.144.23.105]] 11:05, 22 December 2020 (UTC)

You have done assiduous research to prove.... da daa.... drum roll.... that some native speaker do use all such words predicatively. Which I knew. As I have stated in other threads in the December Tea Room, descriptivism is valid, and will eventually drive the development of the language, although for social and cultural reasons (and given our ageing demographic profile where relatively large numbers of people are still alive who don't accept all the new usages), companies, including publishing houses, may wish to maintain more conservative house styles, prescribing some less progressive uses for use in their publications. I think for foreign learners of English, the debate is uninteresting, as they will simply prefer to learn the way younger people speak and the way most native speakers speak, which means in most instances learning US English, or mid-Atlantic forms of British English. But it is worth noting with words like ''key'' that there is a debate over ''correct'' usage, as people over 40 aren't dead yet.

It can't be rephrased as "Go ahead and start in the name of me(?); ... . ."

By that criterion there should be both [[in the opinion of]] (from "in the opinion of the court") and [[in someone's opinion]].

: {{reply to|Lambiam}} Postpositive ''nach'' is used predominantly with possessive pronouns in this idiom, originally this contrasted with the usage with terms other than pronouns: ''nach Xs Meinung''; that the postpositive use has spread to this cases is a secondary analogical development and therefore still unusual in many cases. With personal names it's almost standard (''Herrn Cifcis Meinung nach'', ''Charlies Meinung nach'', although ''nach Xs Meinung, nach Meinung Xs'' are still possible), but ''jemandes Meinung nach'' sounds wrong to my ears (the wording ''nach jemandes Meinung'' sounds smoother) and it would imply that every term in the genitive could be used which is not the case (expressions as ''**der Kanzlerin Meinung nach, **des/eines Lehrers Meinung nach'' aren't in use, it would almost always be ''nach Meinung des/der/eines/einer X''). Besides, in the expression ''[[meines Erachtens|meines, deines, seines Erachtens]]'' you can't fill in other terms than possessive pronouns, I can't imagine that searching for ''jemandes Erachtens'' vel sim would yield any results. The best way to lemmatise this is indeed as is done here [[meines Erachtens]] for various reasons (gender, ''first'' person, usage), but a usage note should explain that ''meines'' can be replaced by the other possessive pronouns. And if we need an entry [[meines Erachtens]], [[meiner Meinung nach]] could follow this precedent. --[[User:Akletos|Akletos]] ([[User talk:Akletos|talk]]) 07:51, 26 December 2020 (UTC)

== Purported Proto-Austronesian term ''S…ômay''? ==

I was exploring some of [[w:Martine Robbeets]]' claims mentioned over at [[w:Altaic_languages#Shared_lexicon]].  She derives {{cog|ja|Á±≥|tr=kome||uncooked rice}} from Proto-Austronesian ''Semay''.  This seems extremely unlikely to me, and I was curious about this, so I had a look at [[rice#Translations]], and ... found no apparent cognates in any of the daughter languages.  Most have some variant of ''[[nasi]]'' for "cooked rice", and ''[[beras]]'', ''[[begas]]'', ''[[bugas]]'' for "uncooked rice".  I found our entry at [[Reconstruction:Proto-Austronesian/S…ômay]], which has zero descendants.

That entry was created by Malay speaker {{user|Amir Hamzah 2008}} in 2012, and basically left untouched since (one move, one bot, no substantive edits to the entry).

Reconstructions of proto forms that have no descendants seem ... of dubious utility, at best.

A person who jockeys for higher position inside a bank, without ever running for political office, would not normally be called a "politician" AFAIK, but can apparently be a politicker.

The verb ''politick'' arose as a backformation, now exclusively with the negative sense. The original verb ''politic'' essentially fell into disuse; people still using it basically mean ''politick'' in the negative sense but use an archaic spelling of the verb.

== [[unitaire]] ==
Does this also have a religious meaning like the English adjective [[Unitarian]]? I'm looking at a text which says the following:

I feel like it implies use as an adjective meaning "Unitarian", seeing as [[d√©iste]], [[positiviste]] correlate with theological definitions, and [[Saint-Simonist]] is an adj in English. I'm not confident enough in French to add new definitions without some confirmation from better speakers. ‚Äî[[User:Jakeybean|Jakeybean]]<sup>'''[[User talk:Jakeybean|TALK]]'''</sup> 01:25, 25 December 2020 (UTC)

== [[donor fatigue]] ==

The current definition seems insufficiently specific: "A phenomenon in which people no longer give to charities, although they have [done so/given to them] in the past." [https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/donor_fatigue Lexico adds] "resulting from the frequency of such appeals", but perhaps the exhaustion of compassion or empathy is more important to mention. Checking on Google Books suggests that this term does not only apply to people giving to charities but also to donor countries giving to charities, projects, relief efforts or directly to developing countries. <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  18:30, 27 December 2020 (UTC)

== Sectionals, regionals, nationals, championships ==

In America, I often hear [[sectionals]] and [[regionals]] being used to refer to competitions as in, "She won first place at regionals, so she'll be going to sectionals!" I do not think that this sense is adequately covered in the entries for [[sectionals]] and [[regionals]], which simply state "plural of (regional or sectional)". Certainly, the entries for the singular [[sectional]] and [[regional]] cover the sense of "A tournament or match held at the ... level" (though regional does this in a roundabout - should a more specific sense be added?), but "sectionals" and "regionals" do not always refer to multiple competitions. If I say "Our team swept at regionals.", I am not saying "Our team swept at the regional competitions." but "Our team swept at the regional competition." Perhaps an argument could be made that since there are typically multiple regionals/sectionals, this plural form is being used to express several separate competitions that form a level of competition. However, you also must contend with the adjacent forms "nationals" and "championships"; saying "She is a qualifier for nationals" cannot refer to multiple competitions in any sense because there is almost always only one competition at the national level (same thing goes with "championships"). I suggest that [[regionals]], [[sectionals]], [[championships]], and [[nationals]] be updated to reflect this usage of the plural form to refer to single events. <b style="line-height:1.1;display:inline-block;transform:skew(-14deg);border-radius:2em;border:solid#34c 1px;overflow:hidden">[[User:Mysterymanblue|<b style="color:#fff;background:#34c">‚ÄÑMysteryman</b>]][[User talk:Mysterymanblue|blue‚ÄÑ]]</b> 03:04, 28 December 2020 (UTC)
:In the case of "regional(s)", I'm not entirely convinced that this sense isn't already covered in the existing definition: "An entity or event with scope limited to a single region." A competition is an event and the a regional would be limited to a single region. Instead of adding a new definition I'd vote for adding example sentences with this and other possible usages. Note that different types of competitions are organized in different ways, and the corresponding governing bodies may use different terminology, or the same terminology may be used to refer to different things. I'm not sure "sectional" is used in thus way, see [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=win+the+regionals%2Cwin+the+sectionals%2Cwin+the+nationals%2C&year_start=1919&year_end=2019&corpus=28&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cwin%20the%20regionals%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwin%20the%20nationals%3B%2Cc0]. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 17:23, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

== [[down with]] ==

Interjection senses:

# {{n-g|Expressing disapproval of or encouraging actions against a person, organization, practice, belief, etc., typically in a public [[protest]].}}
#: '''''Down with''' the government!''
# [[away|Away]] with...!, [[cease]]! {{rfex|en}}
#: '''''Down with''' that noise!''

Don't really understand usex #2. To me it seems an odd thing to say, and the only way I would interpret it is as "Turn/Keep the noise down!", which seems broadly analogous to saying e.g. "Down with the flag!" meaning "Lower the flag!", i.e. open-ended SoP and hardly deserving of an entry. Does anyone else see something else in it? Or, alternatively, can anyone come up with a better example for #2 (that is clearly distinct from #1)? Also not convinced about the PoS, btw.

== [[a God's name]] ==

The entry was created last month with an {{temp|rfdef}} and two citations.

I also see an occurrence of these words in ''The Shoemaker's Holiday'' in ''Elizabethan Drama: Eight Plays'', page 492 (published 1990), where "a" also makes sense as rendering "in": "Will I, quotha? At whoe suit? By my troth, yes, I'll go. A cambric apron, gloves, [...] I'll sweat in purple, mistress, for you; I'll take anything that comes a God's name."; other editions of that work have "a'" with an apostrophe.

== [[fai pure]] ==

Italian interjections like this have different forms depending on who the listener is or the number of listeners ([[fai pure]] for the informal "tu", [[faccia pure]] for the more formal "lei", [[fate pure]] for the plural "voi", and so on). As it happens, we have quite a few of these in [[:Category:Italian interjections]]. Take as a sampling: [[beato te]], [[che ti √® preso]], [[chi ti credi di essere]]. How should we treat this - by making separate entries for each, deleting them all, adding a usage note, etc.? And what should we regard as the "base form" - the more formal version or the informal one?  [[User:Imetsia|Imetsia]] ([[User talk:Imetsia|talk]]) 17:02, 29 December 2020 (UTC)
* The first two Treccani entries I checked (''beato'' and ''prendere'') use the ''tu'' forms in derived expressions so I weakly vote for that.  Some of these are more likely to be used in contexts where I expect familiarity.  (Disclaimer: My native language lacks a T-V distinction and I'm sure I didn't recognize all the subtleties of ''tu'' vs. ''vous'' in the French literature I studied any more than I got Shakespeare's use of ''thou''.)

== [[syne]] pronunciation ==

TLDR: Is /s…ôin/ a possible English pronunciation?

I resolved an rfp by copying pronunciation from NED (OED first edition published 1919) to {{m|en|syne}}. [[User:Kilo Lima Mike]] thinks /s…ôin/ looks weird.  The NED is older than the IPA so it may use symbols differently.  A comment in the dictionary notes of ''syne'', {{m|en|hyne}}, {{m|en|thyne}}, and {{m|en|whyne}}, "The northern-English spellings with ''-ei- (-ey-)'', riming with ''ƒ´'', are common to all four words; their phonological significance is obscure."

[[User:Vox Sciurorum|Vox Sciurorum]] ([[User talk:Vox Sciurorum|talk]]) 22:16, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
: {{IPAchar|/s…ôin/}} is the correct pronunciation for both Scots and Scottish English, where {{IPAchar|/…ôi/}} and {{IPAchar|/a…™/}} are separate phonemes. For RP and General American, which do not have two separate phonemes in this area, I would prefer the transcription {{IPAchar|/sa…™n/}}. I think in all accents of English it's a homophone of {{m|en|sign}} at any rate, and how to transcribe the vowel phoneme is a matter of preference and convention. Some dictionaries write it {{IPAchar|/s å…™n/}}; other possibilities include {{IPAchar|/sain/}} and {{IPAchar|/sajn/}} as well as various non-IPA conventions like /sayn/ or /sƒ´n/. ‚Äî[[User:Mahagaja|MahƒÅgaja]] ¬∑ [[User talk:Mahagaja|''talk'']] 22:50, 30 December 2020 (UTC)

One of the usage notes is: "[T]here are some religious groups that identify themselves as part of Judaism, but that other Jewish groups might not; hence, use of the term ''Jew'' often depends on the speaker's opinions." I want to know what other people think about whether or not it makes sense to bother saying that. It's not wrong, it's just...true of any religious or ethnic group big enough to have factions, isn't it? Should we mention in ''[[Christian]]'' and ''[[Muslim]]'' that some groups like Mormons identify themselves as Christians but other Christian groups historically have not, and that some groups like {{w|Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi}}s consider themselves Muslims but other Muslims often don't?

:: I do not know whether it is true of any sufficiently large ethnic or religious group, but it is indeed true to varying degrees for each of the big five. But to be a devil's advocate for the usage note: ''Jew'' is prominently used in both a religious and an ethnic/cultural sense so that both a non-practicing Jewish atheist and a convert without any Jewish ancestry can lay claim to the term; ''in the West'' it is rather unusual to have such a distinct ethnic/cultural/demographic component: even if a religion had a sharply defined subculture, if one leaves a religion you also leave the demographic/subculture. The question of who is a Jew is historically important and much discussed in Judaism; in some religions the analogous question is considered close to pointless. Then you have edge cases like Ethiopean Jews (MacCulloch considers them to be an Ethiopean development without Jewish ancestry), Messianic Jews (often groups mostly made up of gentiles with a naff fascination with Judaism who were already Evangelical before 'converting'), Hispanics with possible but often nebulous Jewish ancestry reclaiming their Jewishness (potentially in ways quite distinct from any conventionally Jewish group). I think there is a justification for having a usage note addressing this, despite the shortcomings of the current one. I'm not really sure how to improve it.
:: I don't think the need for usage notes at the other entries is justified to the same degree. <small>If you wanted to add a usage note to ''Christian'' I would simply add that Trinitarianism is often considered an essential doctrine by the uninitiated, but I note that historically non-Trinitarian groups were regarded as ''heretics'' (therefore they could be legally burned at the stake), not infidels: at least socially they were regarded as Christians of some kind.</small> <s>‚Üê‚Ç∞-‚Üí</s> [[User:Lingo Bingo Dingo|<small>Lingo</small> <sup>Bingo</sup> <sub>Dingo</sub>]] ([[User talk:Lingo Bingo Dingo|talk]])  15:33, 2 January 2021 (UTC)

[[File:Veƒæk√° jasky≈àa v Dolnom Sokole (2004).jpg|thumb|250px|Ala (1)]]
[[File:Rabbit hole - geograph.org.uk - 1284436.jpg|thumb|175px|Tru≈°u ala (2)]]

===Etymology===
The usual theory considers {{m|lv||ala}} to be borrowed from {{bor|lv|gml|hol|t=depth, hole, cave}}, or maybe from the same form in {{der|lv|dum|-}} or {{der|lv|nds-de|-}} (East Frisian); cf. {{cog|de|H√∂hle|t=cave}}.

A different view suggests that {{m|lv||ala}} could also reflex of an old {{der|lv|ine-pro|-}} stem {{m|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÅel-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*ol-}}, {{m|ine-pro|*al-|t=to flow, to drain}} with various {{cog|bat}} reflexes: dialectal {{m|lv|alots}}, {{m|lv|alogs}}, standard {{m|lv|avots|t=(water) source}}, {{m|lv|alksna}}, {{m|lv|aluksna|t=miry, swampy place}} (cf. place names like {{m|lv|Al≈´ksne}}, {{m|lv|Al≈´kstes}}), {{cog|lt|alƒóÃÅti|t=to flow, to drip}}. The original meaning of {{m|lv||ala}} would thus have been ‚Äú(water) source‚Äù, from which ‚Äúplace (e.g., cave, rift, pit) from which water springs‚Äù and finally simply ‚Äúcave,‚Äù possibly under the influence of the aforementioned {{cog|gem}} words.<ref>{{R:lv:LEV}}</ref>

* '''''Als''''' in the sense of ‚Äúas, like‚Äù is claimed by some traditional grammars to require the nominative case: ''Er verkleidet sich als spanisch'''er''' Stierk√§mpfer.'' (‚ÄúHe dresses himself up as a Spanish bullfighter.‚Äù) This may indeed be the most common usage in reflexive constructions, such as in the example given (although ''als spanisch'''en''' Stierk√§mpfer'' is acceptable). The mechanical use of the nominative, however, is often ungrammatical by any standards of common usage: ''Sie kannte ihn schon als jung'''en''' Mann'' (‚ÄúShe knew him already as a young man‚Äù; the nominative ''als *junger Mann'' would be odd and indeed would suggest the meaning that she knew him when ''she'' was a young man). Thus, the same general rule applies as given above.

Page 110 aufh√∂ren: Found match for regex: =
Page 110 aufh√∂ren: -------- begin text ---------
==German==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|de|gmh|≈´fh≈ìren|t=to stop}}, equivalent to {{prefix|de|auf|t1=up|h√∂ren|t2=to hear, listen, obey}}. The sense is explained as a generalisation from ‚Äúto obey a prohibition and desist‚Äù. Compare archaic {{cog|nl|ophoren}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/Ààa äÃØfÀåh√∏Àêr…ôn/|[Àà îa äÃØfÀåh√∏Àê Å…ôn]|[-Àåh√∏Àê.…ên]|[-Àåh√∏Àê…êÃØn]|[-Àåh≈ì…êÃØn]}}
* {{audio|de|De-aufh√∂ren.ogg|Audio}}

===Verb===
{{de-verb|auf.h√∂ren}}

# {{lb|de|with {{m|de|mit}} + noun or {{m|de|zu}} + infinitive}} to [[stop]]; to [[quit]]; to [[cease]]
#* '''1960''', {{w|Marie Luise Kaschnitz}}, ‚ÄòGespenster‚Äô:
#*: {{quote|de|Aber wir waren beide sehr m√ºde und darum '''h√∂rten''' wir bald '''auf''' zu sprechen.|But we were both very tired, and we soon stopped talking about it.}}
#: {{uxi|de|Der Regen '''h√∂rt''' bestimmt gleich '''auf'''.|Surely the rain will stop soon.}}
#: {{uxi|de|'''H√∂r''' damit '''auf''' und komm her!|Stop that and come here!}}
#: {{uxi|de|Sie hat '''aufgeh√∂rt''' zu rauchen.|t=-}}
#: {{ux|de|Sie hat mit dem Rauchen '''aufgeh√∂rt'''.|She‚Äôs stopped smoking.}}
# {{lb|de|informal}} to stop talking about something {{+preo|de|von}}
#: {{ux|de|Kannst du nicht mal davon '''aufh√∂ren'''? Das ist Jahre her.|Can‚Äôt you stop bringing it up? This was years ago.}}

====Usage notes====
* When followed by another verb, the normal construction is with {{m|de|zu}} + infinitive. Alternatively, the nominal construction with {{m|de|mit}} + gerund (nominalised infinitive) can be used. Colloquially, a transitive construction is also possible: {{m|de||Sie hat das Rauchen aufgeh√∂rt.}} Compare the same in {{m|de|anfangen|t=to start}}.

* {{hyphenation|de|aus|spre|chen}}

===Verb===
{{de-verb|aus.sprechen<spricht#sprach,gesprochen,spr√§che>}}

# {{lb|de|transitive}} to [[pronounce]] {{gloss|sound a word, give it a pronunciation}}

#: {{ux|de|Ich habe mich mit ihr '''ausgesprochen''' und jetzt verstehen wir uns bestens.|I've '''talked things out''' with her and now we get along very well.}}

====Usage notes====
* Except in the sense ‚Äúto finish‚Äù, the German verb is never [[intransitive]]. Hence, for ‚Äúhe pronounces clearly‚Äù one will say: {{m|de||er spricht deutlich}}, or: {{m|de||er hat eine deutliche Aussprache.}} Neither can {{m|de||aussprechen}} be used for {{m+|en|speak out}}.

===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*b ∞uH-|*h‚ÇÅes-|*h‚ÇÇwes-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|been||to be}}. The various forms have three separate origins, which were mixed together at various times in the history of English.
* The forms beginning with ''b-'' come from {{inh|en|ang|bƒìon||to be, become}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*beunƒÖ||to be, exist, come to be, become}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*b ∞√∫Ht||to grow, become, come into being, appear}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*b ∞uH-}}. In particular:<!--moved from [[been]]-->
** Now-dialectal use of ''been'' as an infinitive of ''be'' is from {{inh|en|enm|been|t=to be}}.
** Now-obsolete use of ''been'' as a plural present tense (meaning "are") is from {{inh|en|enm|been}}, {{m|enm|be}} (present plural of {{m|enm|been|t=to be}}, with the ''-n'' leveled in from the past and subjunctive; compare competing forms {{m|enm|aren}}/{{m|enm|are}}).
** Use of ''been'' as a past participle is from {{inh|en|enm|been|}}, {{m|enm|ybeen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|ƒ°ebƒìon}}.
* The forms beginning with ''w-'' come from the aforementioned {{inh|en|ang|bƒìon}}, which shared its past tense with the verb {{m|ang|wesan}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wesanƒÖ}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÇwes-||to reside}}.
* The remaining forms are also from {{inh|en|ang|wesan||to be}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wesanƒÖ}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÅ√©sti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÅes-}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* When used copulatively with a pronoun, traditional grammar puts the pronoun in the [[subjective case]] ({{m|en||I}}, {{m|en||he}}, {{m|en||she}}, {{m|en||we}}, {{m|en||they}}) rather than the [[objective case]] ({{m|en||me}}, {{m|en||him}}, {{m|en||her}}, {{m|en||us}}, {{m|en||them}}), regardless of which side of the copula it is placed. For example, ‚Äú''I was the masked man''‚Äù and ‚Äú''The masked man was I''‚Äù would both be considered correct, while ‚Äú''The masked man was me''‚Äù and ‚Äú''Me was the masked man''‚Äù would both be incorrect. However, most colloquial speech treats the verb ''be'' as transitive, in which case the pronoun is used in the objective case if it occurs after the copula: ‚Äú''I was the masked man''‚Äù but ‚Äú''The masked man was me''‚Äù. This paradigm applies even if the copula is linking two pronouns; thus ‚Äú''I am her''‚Äù and ‚Äú''She is me''", and ‚Äú''Am I me?''‚Äù (versus the traditional ‚Äú''I am she''‚Äù, ‚Äú''She is I''‚Äù, ‚Äú''Am I I?''‚Äù). However, the use of ''whom'' with a copula, as in ‚Äú''Whom are you?''‚Äù, is considered a [[hypercorrection]].
* With the exception of senses 12, 13, and 22, this is generally a [[stative verb]] that rarely takes the continuous inflection. See [[:Category:English stative verbs]]

* The verb {{m|en||be}} is the most irregular non-defective verb in Standard English. Unlike other verbs, which distinguish at most five forms (as in {{m|en||do}}‚Äì{{m|en||does}}‚Äì{{m|en||doing}}‚Äì{{m|en||did}}‚Äì{{m|en||done}}), {{m|en||be}} distinguishes many more:
** {{m|en||Be}} itself is the plain form, used as the infinitive, as the imperative, and as the present subjunctive (though many speakers do not distinguish the present indicative and present subjunctive, using the indicative forms for both).
**:: ''I want to '''be''' a father someday.'' (infinitive)
**:: ''If that '''be''' true...'' (present subjunctive; ''is'' is common in this position)
**:: ''Allow the truth to '''be''' heard!'' (infinitive)<!--As it stood, "Let the truth be heard", it could have been interpreted just as validly as a subjunctive. This version eliminates the ambiguity.-->
**:: ''Please '''be''' here by eight o‚Äôclock.'' (imperative)
**:: ''The librarian asked that the rare books not '''be''' touched.'' (present subjunctive; speakers that do not distinguish the subjunctive and indicative would use an [[auxiliary verb]] construction here)
**: {{senseid|en|dynamic conjugation}}{{m|en||Be}} is also used as the present tense indicative form in the alternate, dynamic / lexical conjugation of ''be'':
**:: ''What do we do? We '''be''' ourselves.'' (first-person plural present indicative, lexical be)
**:: but: ''Who '''are''' we? We '''are''' human beings.'' (first-person plural present indicative, copula be)
**: It is also an archaic alternative form of the indicative, especially in the plural[http://books.google.fr/books?id=q3QSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA357&lpg=PA357&dq=mood+tense+of+be+in+%22I+be%22&source=bl&ots=mjI9wpNsbf&sig=mCMwoBB65B9i6GvFTaOhErLON78&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZUogT7TkGKaksQLgyoSTDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mood%20tense%20of%20be%20in%20%22I%20be%22&f=false]:
**:: ''The [[powers that be|powers that '''be''']], are ordained of God.'' (Romans 13:1, Tyndale Bible, 1526)
**:: ''We are true men; we are no spies: We '''be''' twelve brethren...'' (Genesis 42:31-2, King James Version, 1611)
**:: ''I think it '''be''' thine indeed, for thou liest in it.'' (Hamlet, Act V, Scene 1, circa 1600)
** {{m|en|am|Am}}, {{m|en|are}}, and {{m|en|is}} are the forms of the present indicative. {{m|en||Am}} is the first-person singular (used with {{m|en||I}}); {{m|en||is}} is the third-person singular (used with {{m|en||he}}, {{m|en||she}}, {{m|en||it}} and other subjects that would be used with {{m|en||does}} rather than {{m|en||do}}); and {{m|en||are}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{m|en||we}}, {{m|en||you}}, {{m|en||they}}, and any other plural subjects).
**: '''''Am''' I in the right place?'' (first-person singular present indicative)
**: ''You '''are''' even taller than your brother!'' (second-person singular present indicative)
**: ''Where '''is''' the library?'' (third-person singular present indicative)
**: ''These '''are''' the biggest shoes we have.'' (plural present indicative)
** {{m|en|was|Was}} and {{m|en|were}} are the forms of the past indicative and past subjunctive (like {{m|en||did}}). In the past indicative, {{m|en||was}} is the first‚Äì and third-person singular (used with {{m|en||I}}, as well as with {{m|en||he}}, {{m|en||she}}, {{m|en||it}} and other subjects that would be used with {{m|en||does}} rather than {{m|en||do}}), and {{m|en||were}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{m|en||we}}, {{m|en||you}}, {{m|en||they}}, and any other plural subjects). In the traditional past subjunctive, {{m|en||were}} is used with all subjects, though many speakers do not actually distinguish the past subjunctive from the past indicative, and therefore use {{m|en||was}} with first‚Äì and third-person singular subjects even in cases where other speakers would use {{m|en||were}}.
**: ''I '''was''' out of town.'' (first-person singular past indicative)
**: ''You '''were''' the first person here.'' (second-person singular past indicative)
**: ''The room '''was''' dirty.'' (third-person singular past indicative)
**: ''We '''were''' angry at each other.'' (plural past indicative)
**: ''I wish I '''were''' more sure.'' (first-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also common, though considered less correct by some)
**: ''If she '''were''' here, she would know what to do.'' (third-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also common, though considered less correct by some)
** {{m|en|being|Being}} is the gerund and present participle, used in noun-like constructions, in the progressive aspect, and after various verbs (like {{m|en||doing}}). (It‚Äôs also used as an actual noun; for those senses, see the entry for {{m|en|being}} itself.)
**: ''I don‚Äôt like '''being''' here.'' (gerund)
**: ''All of a sudden, he‚Äôs '''being''' nice to everyone.'' (present participle in the progressive aspect)
**: ''It won‚Äôt stop '''being''' a problem until someone does something about it.'' (present participle in the progressive aspect)
** {{m|en|been|Been}} is the past participle, used in the perfect aspect. In Middle English, it was also the infinitive.
**: ''It‚Äôs '''been''' that way for a week and a half.''
* In archaic or obsolete forms of English, with the pronoun {{m|en|thou}}, the verb {{m|en||be}} has a few additional forms:
** When the pronoun {{m|en||thou}} was in regular use, the forms {{m|en|art}}, {{m|en|wast}}, and {{m|en|wert}} were the corresponding present indicative, past indicative, and past subjunctive, respectively.
** As {{m|en||thou}} became less common and more highly marked, a special present-subjunctive form {{m|en|beest}} developed (replacing the regular present subjunctive form {{m|en||be}}, still used with all other subjects). Additionally, the form {{m|en||wert}}, previously a past subjunctive form, came to be used as a past indicative as well.
* The forms {{m|en||am}}, {{m|en||is}}, and {{m|en||are}} can contract with preceding subjects: {{m|en|I'm|I‚Äôm|I am}}, {{m|en|'s|‚Äôs|is}}, {{m|en|'re|‚Äôre|are}}. The form {{m|en||are}} most commonly contracts with personal pronouns ({{m|en|we're|we‚Äôre|we are}}, {{m|en|you're|you‚Äôre|you are}}, {{m|en|they're|they‚Äôre|they are}}), but contractions with other subjects is possible; the form {{m|en||is}} contracts quite freely with a variety of subjects. These contracted forms, however, are possible only when there is an explicit, non-preposed complement, and they cannot be stressed; therefore, contraction does not occur in sentences such as the following:
*: ''Who‚Äôs here? ‚ÄîI '''am'''.''
*: ''I wonder what it '''is'''.''
*: ''I don‚Äôt want to be involved. ‚ÄîBut you '''''are''''' involved, regardless.''
* Several of the finite forms of {{m|en||be}} have special negative forms, containing the suffix {{m|en|-n't|-n‚Äôt}}, that can be used instead of adding the adverb {{m|en|not}}. Specifically, the forms {{m|en||is}}, {{m|en||are}}, {{m|en||was}}, and {{m|en||were}} have the negative forms {{m|en|isn't|isn‚Äôt}}, {{m|en|aren't|aren‚Äôt}}, {{m|en|wasn't|wasn‚Äôt}}, and {{m|en|weren't|weren‚Äôt}}. The form {{m|en||be}} itself does not, even in finite uses, with ‚Äúnot be‚Äù being used in the present subjunctive and ‚Äúdo not be‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be‚Äù (or, in dated use, ‚Äúbe not‚Äù) being used in the imperative. The form {{m|en||am}} has the negative forms {{m|en|aren't|aren‚Äôt}}, {{m|en|amn't|amn‚Äôt}}, and arguably {{m|en|ain't|ain‚Äôt}}, but all of these are in restricted use; see their entries for details.
* Outside of Standard English, there is some variation in usage of some forms; some dialects, for example, use {{m|en||is}} or {{m|en||‚Äôs}} throughout the present indicative (supplanting, in whole or in part, {{m|en||am}} and {{m|en||are}}), and/or {{m|en||was}} throughout the past indicative and past subjunctive (supplanting {{m|en||were}}).

==German==

===Etymology===
From {{der|de|gml|binnen||within}}, ultimately from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*bi-||by, at}} + {{m|gem-pro|*innan}} << {{m|gem-pro|*in||in}}. The form is also [[Central German]] in {{inh|de|gmh|binnen}} (compare {{cog|lb|bannen}}). It is originally an adverb meaning ‚Äúwithin, inside‚Äù chiefly in local sense, equivalent to German {{m|de|innen}}. ''Binnen'' was adopted in modern standard German as a temporal preposition, while the prefix {{m|de|binnen-}} takes on the local sense of the word. Cognate with {{cog|nl|binnen}}.

====Usage notes====
* {{sense|masculine}} Three territories must be distinguished: 1.) [[Ripuarian]], in which the accusative takes the form of the nominative; 2.) western [[Moselle Franconian]], in which the nominative takes the form of the accusative; 3.) eastern Moselle Franconian, in which nominative and accusative are distinct.
:: 1.) In Ripuarian, the reduced masculine article in nominative and accusative is '''''de''''' only in a few places, including [[w:Bonn|Bonn]]; most dialects have {{m|gmw-cfr|der}}. The full form is always {{m|gmw-cfr|d√§}}.
:: 2.) In western Moselle Franconian, the form is '''''de''''', but becomes {{m|gmw-cfr|den}} before vowels, ''h-'', and dental consonants. The full form is {{m|gmw-cfr|d√§n}}.
:: 3.) In eastern Moselle Franconian, the reduced masculine article in the nominative is '''''de''''' in many dialects, ''der'' in others. The full form is {{m|gmw-cfr|d√§r}}. The accusative takes ''den'' (full form: ''d√§n'').
* {{sense|feminine}} Virtually all dialects use '''''de''''' as the reduced feminine article in nominative and accusative. The full form is {{m|gmw-cfr|die}}. In the dative, '''''de''''' is used in a few dialects of Ripuarian; the general form is ''der''. The full form may be {{m|gmw-cfr|d√§r}} or ''d√§''.
* {{sense|plural}} Virtually all dialects use '''''de''''' as the reduced plural article in nominative and accusative. The full form is ''die''. In the dative, '''''de''''' is used in most dialects of Ripuarian. In Moselle Franconian the form is the same as the masculine accusative (see above). The full form of the dative plural may be ''d√§, d√§n,'' or {{m|gmw-cfr|d√§ne}}.
* Westernmost Ripuarian has no case distinction whatsoever. Only the nominative forms are relevant for these dialects.

=====Usage notes=====
* {{m|la|de|Dƒì}} denotes the [[go out|going out]], [[departure]], [[removal]], or [[separation|separating]] of an object from any fixed point (it occupies a middle place between {{m|la|ab|t=away from}} which denotes a mere external departure, and {{m|la|ex|t=out of}} which signifies from the interior of a thing. Hence verbs compounded with {{m|la|dƒì}} are constructed not only with {{m|la|dƒì}}, but quite as frequently with {{m|la|ab}} and {{m|la|ex}}; and, on the other hand, those compounded with {{m|la|ab}} and {{m|la|ex}} often have the {{m|la|terminus a quo}} indicated by {{m|la|dƒì}}.

* There is the only plural article and like English 'the' is used for nouns of every gender and class. Indefinite nouns in plural are used without article, again as in English.

===Article===
{{head|sv|article}}

# [[the]], a definite article used in the beginning of noun phrases containing attributive adjectives and nouns '''in the plural'''. This article is used '''together''' with the definite suffix of the noun to indicate the definiteness of the noun phrase.
#: {{ux|sv|'''de''' gr√∂na bilar'''na'''|the green cars|inline=1}}
# {{lb|sv|colloquial|text messaging|Internet}} {{pronunciation spelling of|sv|det}}

====Usage notes====
The same type of noun phrases with singular nouns instead use [[den]] (common gender) or [[det]] (neuter) for this function. Some definite noun phrases with attributive adjectives may skip these preceding articles. This is the case especially for many lexicalized noun phrases and also for many noun phrases working as proper names of organisations, geographical places, TV shows, events and similar.
: ''Brittiska √∂ar'''na'''''
:: The British Isles

While the personal pronoun ''de'' has an object form and a genitive form, the definite article ''de'' is unaffected by the syntactic role of the noun phrase.

Page 216 die kalte Schulter zeigen: -------- begin text ---------
==German==

===Etymology===
Literally, "to show the cold shoulder", which uses the verb used in the first recorded use of the expression, which was in 1816 by Sir Walter Scott in Scots (‚ÄúThe Countess‚Äôs dislike didna gang farther at first than just showing o‚Äô the cauld shouther‚Äù.) This expression and its German equivalent are mistranslations of ''{{m|la|dederunt}} [[umerum]] [[recedentem]]'' from the Book of Nehemiah 9.29 from the [[Vulgate]] Bible, which actually means "stubbornly they turned their backs on you", which comes from the [[Septuagint]] Bible's equivalent {{m|grc|·ºîŒ¥œâŒ∫Œ±ŒΩ ŒΩ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ ·ºÄœÄŒµŒπŒ∏Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒ±}}. Latin ''umerus'' means both "shoulder" and "back".

# {{lb|de|transitive|colloquial|rare}} to [[remember]] {{+obj|de|acc}}

====Usage notes====
* That which is remembered was predominantly indicated by a genitive object in older usage (until ca. 1940-1950 in writing), nowadays this is restricted to elevated style. It had also been possible to express that which is reminded with a genitive object, but this usage has been archaic for one or two centuriesÀê
:: {{ux|de|Er erinnerte mich '''dieses Tages'''.|He reminded me of that day.}}
:: {{ux|de|Ich erinnere mich '''dieses Tages'''.|I remember that day.}}

* Today both senses are generally indicated with {{m|de|an}} + accusative:
:: {{lang|de|''Er erinnerte mich '''an diesen Tag'''.''}}
:: {{lang|de|''Ich erinnere mich '''an diesen Tag'''.''}}

* Occasionally, the reflexive verb is replaced with a simple verb + accusative object. Sometimes associated with Northern German, this usage is much less common:
:: {{ux|de|Ich erinnere '''diesen Tag'''.|I remember that day.}}
:But if a passive is desired such use is inevitable, though passive constructions are avoided altogether:
:: {{quote-book|de|last=Sebald|first=Winfried Georg|authorlink=W. G. Sebald|year=2001|title={{w|Austerlitz (novel)|Austerlitz}}|isbn=978-3-596-14864-6|publisher=S.

==German==

===Etymology===
From {{affix|de|gegen√ºber|stehen}}.

===Verb===
{{de-verb|gegen√ºber.stehen<stand,gestanden,st√§nde:st√ºnde.haben,sein>}}

# to [[face]], to [[stand]] [[face-to-face]] with {{+obj|de|dative}}
# {{lb|de|reflexive}} to [[contradict]] [[each other]] {{i|e.g. of viewpoints}}
# {{lb|de|reflexive|sports}} to [[face]] [[each other]], to [[play against]] [[each other]]
# to [[contrast]] {{+obj|de|dative|means=with}}

Only the auxiliary {{m|de|haben}} is used in northern and central Germany. In southern Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, {{m|de|sein}} is common in the vernacular and also, alternatively, in standard usage.

====Conjugation====
{{de-conj|gegen√ºber.stehen<stand,gestanden,st√§nde:st√ºnde.haben,sein>}}

==German==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|de|geh'n}}
* {{l|de|gehn}} {{qualifier|dated in formal prose, but still common informally and poetically}}

===Etymology===
{{root|de|ine-pro|*«µ ∞eh‚ÇÅ-|*«µ ∞eng ∞-}}
From {{inh|de|gmh|gƒÅn}}, {{m|gmh|gƒìn}}, from {{inh|de|goh|gƒÅn}}, {{m|goh|gƒìn}}, from {{inh|de|gmw-pro|*gƒÅn}}, from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*gƒÅnƒÖ}}, from {{der|de|ine-pro|*«µ ∞eh‚ÇÅ-||to leave}}. 

Cognate with {{cog|nl|gaan}}, {{cog|nds|gan}}, {{m|nds|gahn}}, {{cog|en|go}}, Swedish and Danish {{m|sv|g√•}}. 

The form ''gƒìn'' instead of ''gƒÅn'' is of Bavarian origin, but many dialects of Central and Low German have ''-e-'' (from earlier ''-ei-'') or ''ei'' in the 2nd and 3rd person singular present, in keeping with the Proto-Germanic irregular conjugation. The ''-h-'' was introduced into the spelling by analogy with {{m|de|sehen}}, in which it had become mute but was retained in spelling.

====Usage notes====
Unlike English ''to go'', German ''gehen'' does not mean "to travel somewhere" in general. A distinction must be made between ''gehen'' (walk), {{m|de|fahren}} (go by bike, car, train, or ship), and {{m|de|fliegen}} (go by plane). If used with a place one cannot or would not commonly walk to, ''gehen'' often implies that one intends to stay there permanently, e.g.: ''Ich '''gehe''' nach New York.'' ‚Äì I''''m going to live''' in New York.

====Conjugation====
{{de-conj|gehen<ging,gegangen.sein>}}
'''Note:''' The 2nd person plural imperative can also be {{m|de|gehet}}, now in archaic or poetic style.

It must have been tied to a line, and this stone '''gorge''' was covered with a bait; the fish swallowed it, and, the '''gorge''' coming crosswise with the gullet, the fish was captured.

# [[and]] (switching)
#: {{ux|pjt|Watingku ma·∏ªu nyangu '''ka''' wirtjapaka·πâu.|The man saw the kangaroo and the kangaroo ran away.}}

====Usage notes====
* ''Ka'' is a switching conjunction. When it links two clauses or sentences, it conveys that the second clause has a different subject from the first. In cases where the subject remains the same, the conjunction {{l|pjt|munu}} is used. In the example above, the subject of the second clause need not be "the kangaroo", although that seems the most likely possibility from context. The ''ku'' simply tells us that someone or something other than ''wati'' (the subject of the first clause) ran away.
* Although ''ka'' is spelt with a short ''a'', the vowel is actually long (''kaa''). The misleading spelling exists for historical reasons.

*The verb ''Machen'' can be combined with a number of different to create various expressions. These can often be translated into English with [[make]] or [[take]]. For many of these expressions, a more specific verb is available and is usually preferred in formal or written language.

# {{lb|en|obsolete}} {{en-past of|mete}} {{gloss|to measure}}

===Etymology 3===
From {{inh|en|enm|meten||to dream, see in a sweven}}, from {{inh|en|ang|m√¶tan||to dream}}.

# {{lb|en|obsolete}} To [[dream]].
#* '''c. 1653''', {{w|William Cartwright}}, ''The Ordinary''
#*: All night me '''met''' eke that I was at Kirke.

=====Usage notes=====
* ''Met'' is a defective, impersonal verb, and as such it only occurs in the past tense, for example:
: ''Me '''met''' that I was walking in a wondrous wood where a thousand wild wolfins live''. (I '''dreamt''' that I was walking in a wondrous forest where a thousand wild she-wolves live)
* In Old English and Middle English this verb was not defective and was used both personally and impersonally. However, in northern rural dialects, where it is still in use<!-- when? sounds unlikely!! -->, this verb only occurs in the past tense and in impersonal constructions.

From {{etyl|nds-de|de}}. The verb originally means ‚Äúdo business‚Äù and pertains to {{m|de|Makler||broker}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* {{sense|belonging to or associated with}} When applied to a person or persons, the possessive is generally used instead.
* {{sense|containing, comprising{{,}} or made from}} {{m|en||Of}} may be used directly with a verb or adjectival phrase.
* When modifying a noun, modern English increasingly uses [[noun adjunct]]s rather than '''''of'''''. Examples include ''[[part of speech]]'' (16th century) vs. ''[[word class]]'' (20th century), ''{{w|Federal Bureau of Investigation}}'' (1908) vs. ''{{w|Central Intelligence Agency}}'' (1947), and ''affairs of the world'' (18th century) vs. ''world affairs'' (20th century).
* The use of {{m|en|of}} to link nouns to attributive adjectives modified by certain adverbs is always optional; omitting {{m|en|of}} in such instances is always permissible and does not alter the meaning of the expression. Adverbs that may be used with this construction include {{m|en|too}}, {{m|en|so}}, {{m|en|how}}, {{m|en|as}}, {{m|en|more}}, {{m|en|less}}, {{m|en|this}}, and {{m|en|that}}.

From {{inh|lb|gmh|af}}, {{m|gmh|ave}}, from {{inh|de|goh|ava}}, northern variant of {{m|gmh|aba}}, from {{inh|lb|gem-pro|*ab}}. Cognate with {{cog|de|ab}}, {{cog|nl|af}}, {{cog|en|of}} and {{m|en|off}}. The expected Luxembourgish forms are {{m|lb|af}} (< {{m|gmh||af}}) and {{m|lb|uef}} (< {{m|gmh||ave}}).

====Usage notes====
* ''Of'' does not mean "of," even though it's where the word "of" comes from. Instead, the Anglo-Saxons mostly used the [[genitive case]] where we would say "of": ''<u>Dƒìa√∞es</u> god man sƒãeal ofslƒìan'' ("The god <u>of death</u> must be killed"), ''Iƒã hine huntiƒ°e o√æ <u>eor√∞an</u> endas'' ("I'll hunt him to the ends <u>of the Earth</u>"). Even the occasional instances where "of" translates ''of'' are a survival of its original sense "from" or "out of": ''sƒì weall is ƒ°eworht <u>of</u> tiƒ°elan and eor√æteorwe'' ("the wall is made <u>of</u> brick and asphalt"), ''Sƒì H«£lend sƒãolde bƒìon <u>of</u> f«£mnan ƒ°eboren'' ("Jesus was supposedly born <u>of</u> a virgin").

* Note also that ''of'' never means "about." Phrases like "to think of" and "to speak of" are rendered with {{m|ang|be}} or {{m|ang|ymb}}.

* For doing something "out of" an emotion, {{m|ang|for}} is typically used instead of ''of'': ''√û√¶tte <u>for</u> lufum ƒ°ed≈çn bi√æ √æ√¶t ƒ°ewier√æ simle beƒ°eondan g≈çde and yfele'' ("What is done <u>out of</u> love always takes place beyond good and evil").

==Central Franconian==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|gmw-cfr|un}} {{qualifier|widely in free variation}}
* {{l|gmw-cfr|en}} {{qualifier|some western dialects}}

===Etymology===
The native form in most dialects was {{inh|gmw-cfr|goh|indi}}, whence the variant {{m|gmw-cfr||en}}. In parts of the Eifel, this {{m|goh||indi}} regularly becomes {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} (compare {{cog|lb|an}}). In southern and eastern dialects, on the other hand, {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} may have been inherited from the Old High German variant {{m|goh|unde}} ({{m|goh|unti}}). From these two groups of dialects, the form will have spread, without doubt under influence of {{der|gmw-cfr|de|und}}.

===Pronunciation===

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|fr|l'on}} {{qualifier|formal}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|fr|fro|hom}}, {{m|fro|om}} (nominative form), from {{inh|fr|la|hom≈ç||human being}} (compare {{m|fr|homme}} from the Old French oblique form {{m|fro|home}}, from the Latin accusative form {{m|la|hominem}}). Its pronominal use is of {{cog|gem}} origin. Compare {{cog|ang|man||one, they, people}}, reduced form of {{cog|ang|mann||person}}; {{cog|ca|hom}}; {{cog|de|man||one, they, people}}; {{cog|nl|men||one, they, people}}.

==German==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|de|gmh|swermen||to swarm}}, from {{inh|de|goh|swermen||to swarm}}, derived from {{m|goh|swarm||swarm of bees}}, whence modern {{cog|de|Schwarm||swarm; flock of birds}}. The figurative senses developed in early modern German from a sense ‚Äúto deviate from the established dogma or school of thought‚Äù.

===Verb===
{{de-verb|schw√∂ren<schwor:schwur[archaic],geschworen,schw√∂re:schw√ºre>}}

# {{lb|de|intransitive|or|transitive}} to [[swear]]; to take an [[oath]]
#: {{ux|de|Du brauchst nicht zu '''schw√∂ren'''. Ich glaube es dir auch so.|You don‚Äôt need to '''swear'''. I believe you already.}}

#: {{ux|de|Meine Nachbarin '''schw√∂rt auf''' dieses Duschbad.|My neighbour '''swears by''' this shower gel.}}

====Usage notes====
* That which is invoked during the oath is given with the prepositions {{m|de|bei|t=by}} or {{m|de|auf|t=on}}. The latter is chiefly used with something one holds or touches while swearing, e.g. {{m|de||auf die Bibel|t=on the Bible}}. Otherwise {{m|de||bei}} is commoner and only it is generally appropriate with persons or living beings, e.g. {{m|de||bei Gott|t=by God, to God}}.
* The subject or topic of the oath is given with the preposition {{m|de|auf}}, e.g. {{m|de||ich w√ºrde nicht darauf schw√∂ren|t=I wouldn‚Äôt swear on it}}. Only this preposition is also used in the idiom ‚Äúto swear by‚Äù. Hence, the German idiom may mean that one vouches for the quality or effectiveness of something, rather than that one cherishes it so much as to invoke it in one‚Äôs oaths.

Page 768 vergattern: -------- begin text ---------
==German==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/f…õ…êÃØÀà…°at…ên/|/f…ê-/}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|de|gmh|vergatern||to assemble}}, a chiefly [[Central German]] word alongside {{cog|gml|gƒÅderen}}. Cognate to {{cog|nl|vergaderen}}, {{cog|en|forgather}}. In a military context the word originally meant ‚Äúto line up troops and issue the orders‚Äù. It may later have been associated with {{m|de|Gatter||grating, fence}}, thus ‚Äúto give someone a boundary that must not be transgressed‚Äù. Compare etymology 2 below.

====Verb====
{{de-verb}}

# {{lb|de|military|transitive}} to officially [[commit]] a soldier to [[sentry]] duty and to the respective [[regulation]]s
#: {{ux|de|Nachdem der Soldat '''vergattert''' worden ist, muss er sich unter allen Umst√§nden an die Wachbefehle halten.|When a soldier has been '''officially committed to sentry duty''', he must observe the orders to sentry under any circumstances.}}
# {{lb|de|colloquial|transitive}} to [[impose]] a [[duty]] or [[punishment]] on someone {{+preo|de|zu}}
#: {{ux|de|Meine Mutter '''vergattert''' mich immer zum Rasenm√§hen.|My mother always '''makes''' me mow the lawn.}}

=====Conjugation=====
{{de-conj}}

====Derived terms====
* {{l|de|Vergattern}}
* {{l|de|Vergatterung}}

===Etymology 2===
From {{der|de|gmh|vergetern}}, derived from {{m|gmh|gater||grating, fence}}, whence modern {{m|gmh|Gatter||idem}}. The modern verb form without [[umlaut]] was derived through adaptation to the noun.

====Verb====

# {{lb|de|transitive}} to [[barricade]]; to [[separate]] with a [[grating]] or [[fence]]

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/f…õ ÅÀà…°eÀêb…ôn/|/f…ê-/|[f…õ…êÃØÀà…°eÀêb…ôn]|[f…êÀà…°eÀêb…ôn]|[-Àà…°eÀêbmÃ©]}}

#: {{ux|de|Wir haben den Auftrag an ein Drittunternehmen '''vergeben'''.|We have '''awarded''' the contract to an external company.}}

====Usage notes====
* ''Vergeben'' implies a greater degree of moral guilt than {{m|de|verzeihen}}. It is used in the context of sin or crime, or otherwise of severe misbehaviour, such as acts of violence, insult, humiliation, deceit, and the like.
* The noun corresponding to the sense ‚Äúto forgive‚Äù is {{m|de|Vergebung}}, while that corresponding to the sense ‚Äúto assign‚Äù is {{m|de|Vergabe}}.

{{also|Wag|WAG|w√§g}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|waggen}}, probably from {{inh|en|ang|wagian|t=to wag, wave, shake}} with reinforcement from {{der|en|non|vaga|t=to wag, waddle}}; both from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wag≈çnƒÖ|t=to wag}}. Related to {{cog|en|way}}.

The verb may be regarded as an [[iterative]] or emphatic form of {{doublet|en|waw|nocap=1|notext=1|pos1=verb}}, which is often nearly synonymous; it was used, e.g., of a loose tooth. Parallel formations from the same root are the [[Old Norse]] ''vagga'' feminine, cradle (Swedish ''vagga,'' Danish ''vugge''), Swedish {{m|sv|vagga||to rock a cradle}}, Dutch {{m|nl|wagen||to move}}, early modern German ''waggen'' (dialectal German ''wacken'') to waver, totter. Compare [[waggle]], verb

===Verb===

# to be (something)

====Usage notes====
* It cannot be used by itself and must always have a preceding noun that names what it or the person "is".
* It can only be used with a Class II subject marker.
* '''Ya''' is never used with N prefixes.
* It can be used with verb suffixes such as '''[[-tok]]''', '''[[-taam]]''', '''[[-a'chi]]''', etc.
* For sentences where a Class II subject marker is not needed or cannot be used, then the verb root '''[[oo]]''' can be used instead.
* For the future tense, '''[[a'chi]]''' can be used as a standalone word rather than a suffix completely replacing the use of a verb and having the meaning "will be".  Similarly, '''[[a'ni]]''', "might be" could possibly work in a similar fashion, replacing the presence of an explicit verb as well, although it is not normally used in sentences expressing being something.
* The prefix '''[[hoo-]]''' is never used with any forms of the verb "to be" ('''[[ya]]''', '''[[oo]]''', '''[[a'chi]]''').
* To ask questions such as "Is it a/an....", see the entries for the noun suffixes '''[[-toÃ†]]''' (used after consonants) and '''[[-htoÃ†]]''' (used after vowels).

=====Usage notes=====
* The [[genderqueer]] community are the primary proponents of {{m|en||ze}}. One refers to a person with ''ze'' and {{m|en|hir}} or {{m|en|zir}} typically (a) when their gender is unknown, and one wishes to avoid assuming their gender, or (b) when they are neither male nor female in gender, making {{m|en|he}} and {{m|en|she}} (and also either/or terms like {{m|en|s/he}} or {{m|en|(s)he}}) inappropriate and potentially hurtful.

=====Synonyms=====
* ''see'' [[Appendix:English third-person singular pronouns]]

:: {{ux|nl|Ik wist de waarheid niet en ik wilde '''ze''' ook niet weten.|I didn‚Äôt know the truth and didn‚Äôt wish to know '''it''' either.}}
: It is often avoided by using the reduced form {{m|nl|h'r}} or the masculine form {{m|nl|hem}} or the neuter form {{m|nl|het}} or, in formal style, the full form {{m|nl|haar}}.
* In Belgium, ''ze'' is usual as a reduced form of ''haar'' even when referring to persons (as in the example further above).
* ''Ze'' is used in certain short and idiomatic phrases in the imperative wishing one good luck, the most common by far being {{m|nl|werk ze|t=good luck at work!}}.

===Etymology===
{{root|grc|ine-pro|*krey-}}
From {{inh|grc|grk-pro|*kr√≠≈à≈à≈ç}}, from {{der|grc|ine-pro|*kriny√©ti|*kri-n-ye-}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*krey-}}. Cognates include {{cog|en|rinse}}, {{cog|la|cern≈ç||I separate, discern}}, and {{cog|cy|gogrynu}}.

The root of the verb was originally short, but the Attic&ndash;Ionic&ndash;Doric present tense {{m-self|grc|Œ∫œÅ·øëÃÅŒΩœâ}} has a long {{m|grc||·øë}} because the vowel of the root was [[compensatory lengthening|compensatorily lengthened]] after the shortening of Proto-Hellenic {{m|grk-pro||*≈à≈à}}, and the [[aorist]] {{m|grc|·ºîŒ∫œÅ·øëŒΩ·æ∞}} has long {{m|grc||·øë}} because of compensatory lengthening after the loss of the aorist tense-marker {{IPAchar|/s/}} in the original form {{IPAchar|/ekrin-sa/}}. The Aeolic present {{m|grc|Œ∫œÅ·øêÃÅŒΩŒΩœâ}} and aorist {{m|grc|·ºîŒ∫œÅ·øêŒΩŒΩŒµ}} have a short {{m|grc||·øê}} and doubled {{m|grc|ŒΩŒΩ}} because the consonant {{m|grc||ŒΩ}} was compensatorily lengthened instead of the vowel.

==Ancient Greek==

===Etymology===
{{root|grc|ine-pro|*d ∞ewg ∞-}}
From the {{der|grc|ine-pro|-}} root {{m|ine-pro|*d ∞ewg ∞-}}, from which also {{m|grc|œÑŒµœçœáœâ||produce}}.

The present stem {{m|grc|œÑœÖŒ≥œáŒ¨ŒΩœâ}} is a zero-grade form of the root with nasal infix and nasal suffix, like {{m|grc|ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩœâ||take}} and {{m|grc|ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩœâ||do secretly}}. The aorist stem {{m|grc|·ºîœÑœÖœáŒøŒΩ}} is zero-grade with no suffix, and {{m|grc|·ºêœÑœçœáŒ∑œÉ·æ∞}}, and {{m|grc|œÑŒµœÑœçœáŒ∑Œ∫·æ∞}} are zero-grade with regular first-aorist and perfect suffixes. The future {{m|grc|œÑŒµœçŒæŒøŒºŒ±Œπ}} and perfect {{m|grc|œÑŒ≠œÑŒµœÖœá·æ∞}} and {{m|grc|œÑŒ≠œÑŒµœÖŒ≥ŒºŒ±Œπ}} are ''e''-grade. Related to {{m|grc|œÑŒµœçœáœâ}}, which is from a different present stem and with which it shares some forms.

=====Usage notes=====
In writing, '''–≤—ä–≤''' is used in front of words starting with ''–≤'' or ''—Ñ'' and '''–≤''' is used elsewhere. In speech, '''–≤''' and '''–≤—ä–≤''' are used interchangeably. In writing and in speech, '''–≤—ä–≤''' is also used as a stressed form of '''–≤''', even before words not beginning with ''–≤'' or ''—Ñ'', as in
:{{ux|bg|–¢—è –µ '''–≤—ä–≤''' –∫—ä—â–∞—Ç–∞, –∞ –Ω–µ –æ—Ç–≤—ä–Ω.|She is '''in''' the house, not outside.}}
In verse, '''–≤—ä–≤''' can also be used in front of words not starting with ''–≤'' or ''—Ñ'' in order to maintain the syllable structure of the line.

[[File:Triticum turgidum L. Bajuwarenhof Kirchheim 2012-08-05.jpg|thumb|right|{{lang|ar|ÿ®Ÿèÿ±Ÿë}}|upright=1.25]]
Probably one of the words Yemenite expatriates picked up in the {{w|Byzantine Empire}}, from {{bor|ar|grc|œÄœÖœÅœåœÇ}}, similar to {{m|ar|ŸÅŸêÿ±Ÿíÿ≥ŸêŸÉ|t=peach}}, if it is correct that one has to posit for {{der|ar|ine-pro|*p√©h‚ÇÇwrÃ•}}¬†a meaning ‚Äúspelt‚Äù. Another word for spelt or dinkel wheat is borrowed from Ancient Greek: {{m|ar|ÿÆŸÜÿØÿ±Ÿäÿ≥|ÿÆŸéŸÜŸíÿØŸéÿ±ŸèŸàÿ≥}}.

The similar {{cog|he|◊ë÷∏÷º◊®|tr=bƒÅr|t=grain, corn}} may be instead from the same derivation as the etymon of {{m|ar|ÿ®Ÿéÿ≤Ÿíÿ±|t=seed}}. The similarity to {{cog|sla-pro|*b—är—ä|t=foxtail millet}} is also likely a coincidence.

====Usage notes====
* Like all copulative verbs in Arabic, {{m|ar|ŸÉŸéÿßŸÜŸé}} takes a predicate in the accusative case. This contrasts with old Indo-European languages such as Latin and Greek, in which the predicate of a copulative verb is in the nominative case.
*: {{ux|ar|'''ŸÉŸéÿßŸÜŸé''' ÿ¨ŸéŸÖŸéÿßŸÑŸå ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØŸè Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸéŸëÿßÿµŸêÿ±Ÿê '''ÿ±Ÿéÿ¶ŸêŸäÿ≥Ÿé''' ÿ¨ŸèŸÖŸíŸáŸèŸàÿ±ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©Ÿê ŸÖŸêÿµŸíÿ±Ÿé Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©Ÿê.|t=Gamal Abdel Nasser '''was the president''' of the Arab Republic of Egypt.}}
* In the present indicative, ‚Äúto be‚Äù is most often expressed by a [[w:Nominal sentence|nominal sentence]] ({{m|ar|[[ÿ¨ŸèŸÖŸíŸÑŸéÿ©]] [[ÿßÿ≥ŸÖŸä|ÿßŸêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©]]|tr=jumla ismiyya}}) with no verb. In this case, the predicate is in the nominative case.
*: {{ux|ar|ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØŸè ÿßŸÑŸíŸÅŸéÿ™ŸéŸëÿßÿ≠Ÿê Ÿ±ŸÑÿ≥ŸêŸëŸäÿ≥ŸêŸä (ŸáŸèŸàŸé) '''ÿ±Ÿéÿ¶ŸêŸäÿ≥Ÿè''' ÿ¨ŸèŸÖŸíŸáŸèŸàÿ±ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©Ÿê ŸÖŸêÿµŸíÿ±Ÿé Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©Ÿê.|t=Abdel Fattah el-Sisi '''is the president''' of the Arab Republic of Egypt.}}
* Imperfect forms of {{m|ar|ŸÉŸéÿßŸÜŸé}} are not rare, however:
** They occur after certain conjunctions that must always be followed by a verb:
**: {{ux|ar|ÿ£Ÿèÿ±ŸêŸäÿØŸè '''ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸí ÿ£ŸéŸÉŸèŸàŸÜŸé''' ÿ∫ŸéŸÜŸêŸäŸãŸëÿß.|I want '''to be''' rich.}}
** They are sometimes used instead of a nominal sentence to provide for a clearer sentence structure.{{attention|ar|please provide examples}}
* The jussive forms that end in sukun, sometimes drop the final {{m|ar|ŸÄŸÜ}}, giving: {{m|ar|ŸäŸéŸÉŸè}}, {{m|ar|ÿ™ŸéŸÉŸè}}, {{m|ar|ÿ£ŸéŸÉŸè}}, {{m|ar|ŸÜŸéŸÉŸè}}.

==Moroccan Arabic==

===Etymology===
{{ary-rootbox|ŸÑ Ÿà ÿ≠}}
From {{inh|ary|ar|ŸÑŸéÿßÿ≠Ÿé}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|ary|/laÀêƒß/}}

===Verb===
{{ary-verb|I|tr=lƒÅ·∏•|np=ŸäŸÑŸàÿ≠|nptr=yl≈´·∏•}}

Page 1123 ŸÑÿßÿ∑: -------- begin text ---------
==Arabic==

===Etymology===
From the root {{ar-root|ŸÑ|Ÿà|ÿ∑}}. The sense of "anal sex" derives directly from {{m|ar|ŸÑŸèŸàÿ∑|t=Lot}}, with the meaning of "to do as Lot's people did", and was subsequently leveled to the root by analogy. For formation, compare {{noncog|en|sodomize}}

===Pronunciation===
* {{ar-IPA|ŸÑŸéÿßÿ∑Ÿé}}

===Verb===
{{ar-verb|I|a|u}}

# {{lb|ar|intransitive|obsolete}} to [[stick]] to or in {{+preo|ar|ÿ®Ÿê}} (something)
#: {{syn|ar|ŸÑŸéÿµŸéŸÇŸé}}
## {{lb|ar|transitive|obsolete}} to [[stick]] (something) into {{+preo|ar|ÿ®Ÿê}} (something)

====Conjugation====
{{ar-conj|I|a|u|vn=ŸÑŸéŸàŸíÿ∑}}

===Verb===
{{ar-verb|I|a|u}}

# {{lb|ar|intransitive|Islam|derogatory|dated}} to have [[anal]] [[sex]] with {{+preo|ar|ÿ®Ÿê}} (a man), to [[sodomize]]
#: {{hyper|ar|ÿ®Ÿéÿßÿ¥Ÿéÿ±|ŸÜŸéÿßŸÉŸé|q1=largely euphemistic, archaic|q2=vulgar}}

====Conjugation====
{{ar-conj|I|a|u|passive=n?|vn=ŸÑŸéŸàŸíÿ∑}}
{{ar-conj|I|a|u|passive=n?|vn=ŸÑŸêŸàŸéÿßÿ∑}}

====Usage notes====
* Because the verb derives from the name of the Islamic figure himself (unlike {{noncog|en|sodomize}}, which derives from the biblical name of the city), some have come to scruple about or even vehemently denounce the use of words thus derived to refer to homosexual intercourse, instead favoring euphemistic terms and expressions.
* All the other uses of the verb are completely obsolete, as the form has come to be associated solely with sodomy.

===Pronunciation===
* {{hi-IPA}}

===Verb===
{{hi-verb|ur=ÿ®ŸàŸÑŸÜÿß|i}}

# to [[speak]], [[say]]

====Usage notes====
{{m|hi|‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡§®‡§æ}} is an intransitive verb, meaning that its subject does not take the ergative marker in the perfective tenses, instead always being unmarked. Interestingly, the derivatives of {{cog|sa|‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç}} were also intransitive; this phenomenon may be a continuation of that.

From {{pre|sa|‡§µ‡§ø|tr1=v√≠|}}, plus an uncertain second element which has been theorized to be a [[fossilized]] {{der|sa|ine-pro|-}} [[ablative]] suffix {{m|ine-pro|*-neh‚ÇÅ}}, related to {{cog|gem-pro||*-nƒì}} (cf. {{m|gem-pro|*-anƒì}}, {{m|gem-pro|*fanƒì}}) and perhaps {{cog|la||*-nƒì}} in {{m|la|supernƒì}}. {{etystub|sa}}

====Usage notes====
The word preceding {{m|hi|‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ}} is usually inflected in instrumental case.

==Ancient Greek==

===Etymology===
{{root|grc|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÇew-|*h‚ÇÇe·∏±-|id1=perceive}}
From {{inh|grc|grk-pro|*akouh≈ç}}, from {{inh|grc|ine-pro|*h‚ÇÇ·∏±h‚ÇÇowsy√©ti}}, and cognate with {{cog|en|hear}}, {{m|en|hark}} and {{m|en|harken}}. In this word, the diphthong {{m|grc||ŒøœÖ}} is genuine (see {{w|spurious diphthong}} on Wikipedia for an explanation).

===Pronunciation===
{{grc-IPA|·æ∞Œ∫Œøœçœâ}}

===Verb===
{{grc-verb|·æ∞ÃìŒ∫Œøœçœâ}}

====Usage notes====
Usually, the object which is heard takes the [[accusative]] case, while the speaker, when present, takes the [[genitive]]. Sometimes the object is in the genitive, or the person is introduced with a preposition.

====Inflection====
Attic uses the future middle {{m|grc|·ºÄŒ∫ŒøœçœÉŒøŒºŒ±Œπ}}, while future active {{m|grc|·ºÄŒ∫ŒøœçœÉœâ}} appears in Koine.

===Etymology===
If the nasal is originally a present marker, as in {{m|grc|Œ∫ŒªŒØŒΩœâ}} and {{m|grc|œÄŒªœçŒΩœâ}}, we have a root ''·ºÄŒºœÖ-'', which may be found in {{m|grc|·ºÄŒºŒµœçŒøŒºŒ±Œπ||to surpass, outstrip}}, but the semantics are {{unk|grc|title=not quite clear}}.

Generally, the object being protected received the accusative case, while the offending object receives the dative. The second sense, "avenge" is more common in the middle voice.

===Etymology===
{{root|grc|ine-pro|*sek ∑-|id=follow}}
Present stem from ''e''-grade of {{der|grc|ine-pro|*sek ∑-}}. The nonfinite aorist stem {{m|grc||œÉœÄ-}} is from the zero-grade {{m|ine-pro||*sk ∑-}}, and the finite aorist stem {{m|grc||·ºëœÉœÄ-}} was formed by adding a rough breathing {{m|grc|·øæ}} to the augment {{m|grc|·ºê-}}, by analogy with the present stem. Cognates include {{cog|sa|‡§∏‡§ö‡§§‡•á|tr=s√°cate}}, {{cog|ae|ê¨µê¨Äê¨óê¨Äê¨åê¨ôê¨â}}, and {{cog|la|sequor}}.
