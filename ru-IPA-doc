{{documentation subpage}}
This template automatically generates pronunciation for Russian words, relying on [[Module:ru-pron]].

Parameters:
; {{para|1}}
: Word or phrase, including accent marks. If omitted, defaults to the page name (only useful when the word is one syllable or includes ё, or when {{para|phon}} is used). Can be either in Cyrillic or transliteration.
; {{para|phon}}
: Phonological respelling of the word or phrase; use in place of {{para|1}}. If used, this should be Cyrillic. This is used, for example, when a written е is pronounced э. Do not use for indicating gemination or lack thereof, or for indicating the pronunciation of final -е, or for г pronounced [ɣ].
; {{para|adj}}
: Indicate that final -го should be pronounced /vo/, as in the genitive of adjectives.
; {{para|gem}}
: If <code>y</code>, force gemination to be preserved in places it otherwise wouldn't. If <code>n</code>, force degemination in places it otherwise would be preserved. If <code>opt</code>, force optional gemination, including in places it wouldn't normally be preserved. See below.
; {{para|pos}}
: Part of speech code for controlling phonological outcomes that depend on the grammatical role of the word or words in question. Currently used only for final unstressed -е. See below.
; {{para|raw}}
: Render the result "raw", e.g. {{ru-IPA|вода́|raw=y}} instead of {{ru-IPA|вода́}}.
; {{para|bracket}}
: Control whether brackets appear around the generated IPA. Default is yes. Use {{para|bracket|n}} or {{para|bracket|}} to suppress the bracket.

==Accent marks==
* Indicate primary stress with an acute accent, e.g. е́ or ы́.
* Indicate secondary stress with a grave accent, e.g. ѐ or ы̀.
* Indicate "tertiary" stress with a circumflex or double grave accent, e.g. е̂ or ы̂ or е̏ or ы̏ (i.e. where a vowel is to be treated as stressed but should not be marked as possessing either primary or secondary stress).
* Force the reduced pronunciation of a vowel that would otherwise be stressed (e.g. in a single-syllable word) with a dot above, e.g. е̇ or ы̇.

==Part of speech codes==
The value of the {{para|pos}} parameter can be either a single part of speech code or a series of such codes separated by slashes. In the former case, the same part of speech applies to all words in a multi-word phrase. In the latter case, there should be as many codes as there are ''phonological words'' (otherwise, an error will result, tell you the expected number of words). Rules for phonological words:
* Both spaces and hyphens separate phonological words. Hence ка-гэ-бэ is three phonological words.
* A comma, en dash (–) or em dash (—) counts as a phonological word.
* Unstressed [[clitic]] particles that phonologically join to an adjacent word (indicated by a ‿ sign between the words on output) do ''not'' count as separate phonological words, even if separated from the adjacent word by a space or hyphen in the input. Examples are prepositions such as с, к, о, на, без, перед and post-particles such as же, ли, либо, нибудь, but only when these particles have no stress mark on them or are explicitly joined to the adjacent word using the ‿ sign. When in doubt, the IPA output should clarify things: Each phonological word is separated by a space, and each space delimits a phonological word.

As mentioned above, part of speech codes are currently only used for determining the correct pronunciation of unstressed final -е (which may be pronounced [ə], [e], [ɪ] or [ɨ], depending on part of speech and the preceding letters).

The possible part of speech codes are:
* ''omitted'' or <code>def</code> = Default ([ə] in the ending -ое, else same as <code>mid</code>)
* <code>n</code> or <code>noun<code> = Neuter noun in the nominative/accusative  (but not ending in adjectival -ое or -ее; those should be considered as adjectives)
* <code>pre</code> = prepositional case singular
* <code>dat</code> = dative case singular (treated same as prepositional)
* <code>voc</code> = vocative case (currently treated as <code>mid</code>)
* <code>nnp</code> = noun nominative plural in -е (гра́ждане, боя́ре, армя́не); not adjectival plurals in -ие or -ые, including adjectival nouns (да́нные, а́вторские)
* <code>inv</code> = invariable noun or other word (currently treated as <code>mid</code>)
* <code>a</code> or <code>adj</code> = adjective or adjectival noun (typically either neuter in -ое or -ее, or plural in -ие, -ые, or -ье, or short neuter in unpaired sibilant + -е)
* <code>c</code> or <code>com</code> = comparative (typically either in -ее or sibilant + -е)
* <code>adv</code> = adverb
* <code>p</code> = preposition (treated same as adverb)
* <code>v</code>, <code>vb</code>, <code>verb</code> = verbal ending (usually 2nd-plural in -те); not participle forms, which should be treated as adjectives
* <code>pro</code> = pronoun (кое-, какие-, ваше, сколькие)
* <code>num</code> = number (двое, трое, обе, четыре; currently treated as <code>mid</code>)
* <code>pref</code> = prefix (treated as <code>high</code> because integral part of word)
* <code>hi</code> or <code>high</code> = force high values ([ɪ] or [ɨ])
* <code>mid</code> = force mid values ([e] or [ɨ])
* <code>lo</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>schwa</code> = force low/schwa value ([ə])

==Special phonetic symbols and rules==
* In Cyrillic, use h or ɣ to indicate [ɣ] (the voiced fricative pronunciation of the letter г), and ӂ to indicate [ʑ] (the soft pronunciation of ж, as in words like {{m|ru|съе́зжая}}, {{m|ru|вожжа́}} or {{m|ru|дро́жжи}}).
* Use щч or ɕч to force the pronunciation [ɕt͡ɕ]. By default, some instances of сч are pronounced [ɕt͡ɕ] and some are pronounced [ɕː], according to the following rules:
*# [зж]ч and [сзшж]щ are pronounced [ɕː], like щ.
*# сч at the beginning of a word and in the sequence счёт (unless preceded by [дтц]) is pronounced [ɕː]: hence счита́ть {{ru-IPA|счита́ть|raw=y}}, просчёт {{ru-IPA|просчёт|raw=y}}, подсчёт {{ru-IPA|подсчёт|raw=y}}.
*# Other сч are pronounced [ɕt͡ɕ].
* Use / to force a syllable boundary before a consonant. This also forces the "long" pronunciation [t͡ss] of тс, and similarly [d͡zz] for дз, and is useful particularly when another consonant follows, because otherwise the "short" pronunciations [t͡s] and [d͡z] would be used; an example is ветслу́жба, which should be written вѐт/слу́жба. The exact rules for when the short and long pronunciations are used is as follows:
*# [дт] с and [дт] з across a word boundary use the long pronunciation, as do [дт]/с and [дт]/з with explicitly written slash.
*# [дт]с + vowel and [дт]з + vowel use the long pronunciation.
*# [дт]ьс and [дт]ьз use the long pronunciation, with palatalized tʲ͡sʲ and dʲ͡zʲ.
*# Word-initial отс-, подс- use the long pronunciation, because there is a morpheme boundary involved.
*# Other [дт]с and [дт]з use the short pronunciation.
*# [дт]ш and [дт]ж, including with an intervening ь, always use the long pronunciations t͡ʂʂ and d͡ʐʐ (possibly with the first part palatalized).
* Use ‿ to force close juncture between words (treat the combination as a single word). Examples: {{temp|ru-IPA|не́‿за‿што}} becomes {{ru-IPA|не́‿за‿што|raw=y}}, {{temp|ru-IPA|гра̂д‿идёт}} becomes {{ru-IPA|гра̂д‿идёт|raw=y}}.
* Comma and em/en dashes (– and —) are converted to foot boundaries ( | ).

==Gemination==
Geminated consonants (including cases like зж that become geminated after assimilation) may or may not be rendered with gemination. Use {{para|gem}} to override the defaults, e.g.:
# {{temp|ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=y}} becomes {{ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=y|raw=y}}
# {{temp|ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=n}} becomes {{ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=n|raw=y}}
# {{temp|ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=opt}} becomes {{ru-IPA|да́нный|gem=opt|raw=y}}
As an exception, щ is always rendered [ɕː], and ӂӂ is always rendered [ʑː], regardless of {{para|gem}}. The same thing applies to combinations that are pronounced as щ (e.g. some сч, see above), regardless of {{para|gem}}.

Optional gemination can also be forced by writing ''C(C)'', e.g. {{temp|ru-IPA|да́н(н)ый}} becomes {{ru-IPA|да́н(н)ый|raw=y}}.

By default, gemination is normally preserved:
* When occurring directly after the stress and between vowels, except for лл.
* In the combinations йя, йе, йи, йьо, йю when occurring directly after the stress and between vowels; these are treated as containing /jj/.
* When occurring at the beginning of a word in вв-, сс-, жж-, зз-, шш- and combinations pronounced the same (e.g. сз-).
* Whenever the pronunciation [ɕː] (e.g. from щ and initial сч-) and [ʑː] (from ӂӂ) occurs. As mentioned above, this cannot be overridden by {{para|gem}}.
* In the combinations жж and зж when occurring between vowels anywhere in a word.
* In the combination нн when occurring between vowels before the stress.
* In the combination сск when occurring directly after the stress.
* At boundaries between certain prefixes and roots (e.g. рас-, раз-, ис-, из-, под-, от-, в-, с-, нис-, низ-, контр-; also the same when additionally prefixed by не-).

By default, gemination is normally rendered as optional:
* In the combination нн when occurring between vowels after but not directly after the stress: {{temp|ru-IPA|жа́ренный}} becomes {{ru-IPA|жа́ренный|raw=y}}.

By default, gemination is normally not preserved in all other circumstances. Note that this includes most occurrences of gemination not between vowels, e.g. {{temp|ru-IPA|финн}} becomes {{ru-IPA|финн|raw=y}}.
