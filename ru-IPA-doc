{{documentation subpage}}
This template automatically generates pronunciation for Russian words, relying on [[Module:ru-pron]].

Parameters:
; {{para|1}}
: Word or phrase, including accent marks. If omitted, defaults to the page name (only useful when the word is one syllable or includes ё, or when {{para|phon}} is used). Can be either in Cyrillic or transliteration.
; {{para|phon}}
: Phonological respelling of the word or phrase; use in place of {{para|1}}. If used, this should be Cyrillic. This is used, for example, when a written е is pronounced э. Do not use for indicating gemination or lack thereof, or for indicating the pronunciation of final -е, or for г pronounced [ɣ].
; {{para|adj}}
: Indicate that final -го should be pronounced /vo/, as in the genitive of adjectives.
; {{para|gem}}
: If <code>y</code>, force gemination to be preserved in places it otherwise wouldn't. If <code>n</code>, force degemination in places it otherwise would be preserved. If <code>opt</code>, force optional gemination, including in places it wouldn't normally be preserved. See below.
; {{para|pal}}
: Force palatalizaiton of consonants where not indicated by spelling. Not currently used anywhere.

==Accent marks==
Indicate primary stress as e.g. е́ or ы́. Indicate secondary stress as e.g. ѐ or ы̀. Indicate "tertiary" stress as e.g. е̂ or ы̂ (i.e. where a vowel is to be treated as stressed but should not be marked as possessing either primary or secondary stress).

==Nonstandard phonetic symbols==
In Cyrllic, use ɣ to indicate [ɣ] (the voiced fricative pronunciation of the letter г), and ӂ to indicate [ʑ] (the soft pronunciation of ж, as in words like {{m|ru|съе́зжая}}, {{m|ru|вожжа́}} or {{m|ru|дро́жжи}}).

==Gemination==
Rules for when gemination is preserved:
* Gemination is normally preserved directly after the stress; also elsewhere when a double н. Use {{para|gem}} to override.
* Gemination is normally preserved at boundaries between certain prefixes and roots (e.g. рас-, раз-, ис-, из-, под-, от-, в-, с-, нис-, низ-, контр-; also the same when prefixed by не-).
* However, gemination is normally not preserved before another consonant, except at prefix boundaries or in the combinations сск or зск.
* Gemination is always preserved in щ or combinations that are pronounced the same (e.g. сч), regardless of {{para|gem}}.
