-- This array consists of category match specs. Each spec contains one or more properties, whose values are (a) strings
-- that may contain references to other properties using the {{{PROPERTY}}} syntax; (b) functions of one argument, an
-- `items` table of the same properties that are accessible using the {{{PROPERTY}} syntax. Each such spec should have
-- at least a `regex` property that matches the name of the category. Capturing groups in this regex can be referenced
-- in other properties using {{{1}}} for the first group, {{{2}}} for the second group, etc. (or using keys "1", "2",
-- etc. in functions). Property expansion happens recursively if needed (i.e. a property can reference another property,
-- which in turn references a third property).
--
-- If there is a `language_name` propery, it specifies the language name (and will typically be a reference to a
-- capturing group from the `regex` property); if not specified, it defaults to "{{{1}}}" unless the `nolang` property
-- is set, in which case there is no language name derivable from the category name. The language name must be the
-- canonical name of a recognized regular language, or an error is thrown; however, if the `etym_lang_only`
-- property is set, the language name must be the canonical name of an etymology-only language, or the category spec
-- entry will be skipped. Based on the language name, the `language_code` and `language_object` properties are
-- automatically filled in. If `language_name` is an etymology-only language, additional properties
-- `parent_language_name`, `parent_language_code` and `parent_language_object` are set for the parent regular language
-- of the etymology-only language.
--
-- If the `regex` values of multiple category specs match, the first one takes precedence.
--
-- Recognized or predefined properties:
--
-- `pagename`: Current pagename.
-- `regex`: See above.
-- `1`, `2`, `3`, ...: See above.
-- `language_name`, `language_code`, `language_object`: See above.
-- `parent_language_name`, `parent_language_code`, `parent_language_object`: See above.
-- `nolang`: See above.
-- `etym_lang_only`: Language names must be etymology-only languages. See above.
-- `description`: Override the description (normally taken directly from the pagename).
-- `template_name`: Name of template which generates this category.
-- `template_sample_call`: Syntax for calling the template. Defaults to "{{{template_name}}}|{{{language_code}}}".
--    Used to display an example template call and the output of this call.
-- `template_actual_sample_call`: Syntax for calling the template. Takes precedence over `template_sample_call` when
--    generating example template output (but not when displaying an example template call) and is intended for a
--    template call that uses the |nocat=1 parameter.
-- `template_example_output`: Override the text that displays example template output (see `template_sample_call`).
-- `additional_template_description`: Extra text to be displayed after the example template output.
-- `parents`: Parent categories. Should be a list of elements, each of which is an object containing at least a name=
--    and sort= field (same format as parents= for regular raw categories, except that the name= and sort= field will
--    have {{{PROPERTY}}} references expanded). If no parents are specified, and the pagename is of the form
--    "Requests for FOO by language", the parent will be "Request subcategories by language" with FOO as the sort key.
--    Otherwise, the `language_name` property must exist, and the parent will be "Requests concerning LANGNAME" with
--    the pagename minus any initial "Requests for " as the sort key.
-- `umbrella`: Parent all-language category. Sort key is based on the language name.
-- `breadcrumb`: Specify the breadcrumb. If `parents` is given, there is no default (i.e. it will end up being the
--    pagename). Otherwise, if the pagename is of the form "Requests for FOO by language", "Requests for FOO in BAR",
--    or "Requests for FOO", it will be FOO.
-- `not_hidden_category`: Don't hide the category.
-- `catfix`: Same as `catfix` in regular labels and raw categories, except that request-specific {{{PROPERTY}}} syntax
--    is expanded.
-- `toc_template`, `toc_template_full`: Same as the corresponding fields in regular labels and raw categories, except
--    that request-specific {{{PROPERTY}}} syntax is expanded.
--
-- In general, properties can contain references to templates (e.g. {{tl}} and {{para}}), which will be appropriately
-- expanded (this expansion happens in the poscatboiler code, not in this module). The major exception is in the
-- `template_sample_call` and `template_actual_sample_call` properties, which are surrounded by <pre>...</pre> when
-- inserted, so template references are not expanded. Triple-brace property references are still expanded in these
-- properties; but beware that if any of those property references contain template references, they won't be expanded.
-- (This actually happens in the handlers for 'Request for SCRIPT script for LANG terms'; the sample call references
-- {{{script_code}}}, whose definition therefore cannot contain template references. The solution is to define this
-- property using a function.)

The purpose of this category is to tag entries that use headers with "Pronunciation" and a number.

While these headers and structure are sometimes used, they are not specifically prescribed by [[WT:ELE]]. No complete proposal has yet been made on how they should work, what the semantics are, or how they interact with multiple etymologies. As a result they should generally be avoided. Instead, merge the entries (possibly under multiple Etymology sections, if appropriate), and list all pronunciations, appropriately tagged, under a Pronunciation header.

[[User:KassadBot|KassadBot]] tags these entries (or used to tag these entries, when the bot was operational). At some point if a proposal is made and adopted as policy, these entries should be reviewed.
