{{maincat|Old English language}}

The aim of this page is to standardize the layout of [[Old English]] entries and explain the rationale behind that standardization.

==Diacritical marks==
Although they appeared in a few late manuscripts, by and large the Anglo-Saxons did not use diacritical marks to distinguish between short and long vowels.  Such marks are modern additions used in dictionaries and textbooks – that is why some editors use acute accents (´) and others use macrons (¯).  Consequently, Old English entries here should be '''without diacritical marks''' in the page title.  Within the entry itself, any necessary marks can and should be used with the word as given under the part-of-speech heading. The custom here is to use macrons for long vowels. In templates, both the macron and the dot above ''c'' and ''g'' to mark palatals will be displayed, but ignored for links, thus <code>&#123;{m|ang|ċēse}&#125;</code> will display as {{m|ang|ċēse}} but will link to [[[[cese#Old English]]]].

==G and C==
The Anglo-Saxons used the letter G for the hard {{IPAchar|/ɡ/}} sound as well as soft {{IPAchar|/j/}}.  Many modern editions distinguish between the two using diacritical marks.  On Wiktionary this is normally done with a superscript dot ({{lang|ang|ġ}}); on some (older) entries a yogh ({{lang|ang|ȝ}}) is used. '''Do not create Old English page titles using yoghs!'''  Contrary to what some people seem to think, the letter yogh did not exist until the Middle English period.  In actual fact, the letter used by the Anglo-Saxons is called ''[[w:Insular script|insular]] G'', and for reference it looked like this: {{lang|ang|ᵹ}}.  Although it is now in Unicode (because it's used in Irish phonetics), there is no point using it for OE entries, any more than using manuscript forms of R, S, and all the other letters which looked different back then.  Again, these marks are not used in page titles and can be piped in for links: {{lang|ang|<nowiki> [[gear|ġēar]] </nowiki>}}.

On similar lines, Old English '''C''' is used for both {{IPAchar|/k/}} and {{IPAchar|/tʃ/}}. For distinction in piped links, a {{lang|ang|<nowiki>ċ</nowiki>}} can be used - again, this should not be used in ''page titles'', only in head words.

==Þ and Ð==
These two letters (thorn and eth) were interchangeable in Old English.  In common with virtually all Old English dictionaries and grammars, entries here are given with '''þ'''. There is no reason why entries using '''ð''' should not exist as well; there is a lot of work waiting for someone if they want to start creating entries for the alternative forms with eths.

==Wynn==
Wynn was a character used by the Anglo-Saxons for {{IPAchar|/w/}}; it looks like this: {{lang|ang|'''ƿ'''}}. Wiktionary entries are acceptable both using wynn (as in most manuscripts) and using W (as in most modern editions).

==Typesetting==
Many browsers’ default fonts render Old English macrons and other special characters poorly. On Wiktionary, text marked as Old English therefore uses the special "Latinx" script code, which helps browsers choose the best font. {{temp|lang|ang|...}} tags text as Old English and applies this script formatting. It can be as a wrapper around Old English text:

 <nowiki>
#* {{circa|700}} ''Beowulf'':
#*: {{lang|ang|Hwæt! wē Gār-Dena in geār-dagum,}}
#*: {{lang|ang|þeod-cyninga, '''þrym''' gefrunon,}}
#*:: What! We [of] Gar-Danes(lit. spear-danes) in yore-days,
#*:: [of] people-kings, trim(glory) apried(have learned of by asking or "prying"),</nowiki>

#* {{circa|700}} ''Beowulf'':
#*: {{lang|ang|Hwæt! wē Gār-Dena in geār-dagum,}}
#*: {{lang|ang|þeod-cyninga, '''þrym''' gefrunon,}}
#*:: What! We [of] Gar-Danes(lit. spear-danes) in yore-days,
#*:: [of] people-kings, trim(glory) apried(have learned of by asking or "prying"),

Any template that requires a language code will apply the appropriate formatting to the text given to it automatically. This includes basic and widely used templates like {{temp|l}}, {{temp|m}}, {{temp|t}}, {{temp|head}} and so on. These templates also automatically strip macrons off vowels and dots off ''c'' and ''g'', so it is not necessary to list the forms with and without diacritics separately. For example, {{temp|m|ang|ġēar}} renders as {{m|ang|ġēar}}, which links to the diacritic-free [[[[gear#Old English]]]].

Why did you remove the notice of this from [[WT:ELE]]? It is still on the discussion page, but it is not as visible there as on the article itself.  BTW I also added a notice of the proposal to [[WT:BP]]. [[User:Facts707|Facts707]] 19:36, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
:It was misleading (only one editor that I can see) and badly formatted (such hatnotes, when necessary, are added in indented italics - ala {{temp|also}}). Additionally, it's not really necessary - particularly now it's mentioned on WT:BP too - the name of that page is one of the least serious faults with the page, so advertising more prominently advertised than the /editable version does seems to give the wrong impression.

:: Ahh, I see the problem. When I first proposed the rename, I suggested simply [[WT:Entry layout]]. This was also suggested earlier by another editor and disputed by yet others (I copied those entries into the new request). I later changed my request to [[WT:Entry layout guidelines]], but since that particular name was not suggested by another editor, I should have changed the rename notification to "An editor has proposed that this article be renamed to Entry layout guidelines, along with other suggestions from other editors.", which I have now done (but only on the talk page, not the actual page). But "badly formatted" because something is not in italics sounds a bit harsh. And other requests, such as for deletions, are not in italics. I would have used a template, but apparently there isn't one for moves as there are for deletions {{template|rfd}} or requests for verfications {{template|rfv}}.

Hi, Conrad.

== Not sure how feasible this is, buuut ==

So I've recently added the option for showing comparative forms of Persian adjectives in {{temp|fa-adj}}, and I was wondering if it would be possible to have these accelerated with transliteration. This will always be the transliteration of the main word + -tar for comparatives, + -tarin for superlatives. [[بلندتر]] is what the output should look like for comparatives, and [[بلندترین]] for superlatives. The only differences are the two letters in the tr= and c/s in the fa-adj-form template. Would it be possible for creation.js to read the tr= parameter of {{temp|fa-adj}} to automatically include tr= in the comparative/superlative forms' {{temp|fa-word}}? — <font face="Lucida console">[&#32;'''[[User:Opiaterein|R·I·C]]'''&#32;] <small>[[User talk:Opiaterein|opiaterein]]</small></font> — 21:18, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

== Readings question ==

Here's a wikipedia article [[w:Kanji#Readings]] for a more thourough explaination for the Japanese persepective. I'm unsure about the other languages, but in Japanese, a chinese character usually has more than one pronunciation, or 'reading'. So what the on-reading and kun-reading headings are signifiying is that the chinese characters listed can have the reading of the current page. For example, in [[なん]], which is ''nan'' written phonetically, it is saying that the listed characters can take the reading ''nan''. The lists are useful and the current headings are probably the best way to express them as most of the Japanese learing guides I have seen use this terminology. The format for these entries is defined at [[Wiktionary:About Japanese#Hiragana entries]].--[[User:Balloonguy|balloonguy]] 17:27, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

== Hungarian index - empty vowel pages ==

Hi Conrad, I've noticed that the vowel pages are empty in the latest index update (a, e, i, o, ö, u, ü). I also noticed that the two-letter links at each header contain the long vowels instead of the short ones as before, e.g. ká, ké, kó instead of ka, ke, ko. Have you made any change in the code? Thanks. --[[User:Panda10|Panda10]] 19:52, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
:Hi, yes - I was implementing the change suggested in Reverse Index above (do you still want that by the way?) to sort the long vowels the same as the short ones (except where the word is otherwise identical) - I've clearly put it the wrong way up in the headings though, sorry. Should be fixable. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 20:15, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
::Ok. So it seems that while one thing was fixed (short vowel = long vowel in sorting), there is something weird going on with the sorting but I don't understand the pattern. Here is an example: 
::* Current: odaad, odaát, oda-, oda, óda, odahív, odaliszk, -od, Odera-Frankfurt, -odik, -ódik
::* Should be: -od, oda, oda-, óda, odaad, odaát, odahív, odaliszk, Odera-Frankfurt, -odik, -ódik

Hi. I have been given your name by User:Sven70 as a neutral admin on Wiktionary. I would note that I recently initiated a discussion at the Beer parlour regarding the indef block of Sven70.

I have advised him that it may not ultimately change the way things are, but he is more concerned that he is properly understood. I have spoken to Sven on voip, and he is easy to understand (providing the line is good) and expresses himself well.

== Auto-creation of Ido plurals with hyphens ==

Hi there Conrad.  Can you change the automated creation of Ido plurals that have hyphens in them to not link the inflection line, but for multiple word entries, to link them?

Basically, what I am asking is this:

Say I have a word imprim-proburo.  Could you make the automated creation of imprim-proburi to ''not'' link imprim and proburi?
Say I have a word heleboro negro.  Could you make the automated creation of heleboro negro link heleboro and negro?

The reason for this is because if it links proburi and imprim (and imprim itself is not an Ido word), it makes more work for me because I have to unlink them manually.  Could you possibly make it so that it doesn't do that for just the words with hyphens?  Thanks, [[User:Razorflame|<b style="color:#00C">Raz</b><b style="color:#009">or</b>]][[User talk:Razorflame|<b style="color:#006">fl</b><b style="color:#003">am</b><b style="color:#000">e</b>]] 17:36, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

: I am not sure who benefits from things like this - is it just IE6 users or do other windowsy folk need them too? The code looks fine, and compared to the vast swathes of javascript we already force on people, it's not huge (we could even make it only load for those browsers that need it). There are a few minor javascript errors, but the general approach is fine: src() isn't defined where you use it first, so put "function src()" at the top. Then wrap the whole thing in addOnloadHook(function(){ ... }); so that it doesn't try and find the heading. Also declare "var i", and use .className += " " + scr() rather than .setAttribute("class"). One other thing that would seem to fail is for titles with spaces and punctuation - which presumably shouldn't count towards which script it is in - may cause it to fail completely; not sure the best way to fix that, maybe just sum  all the src() occurrence and chose the highest. I would be quite excited if we could make this work as an alternative to our current Xyzy approach too (either in Javascript or PHP).

== Nearby pages ==

If you're still working on finals (or still celebrating their completion), please feel free to not respond to or even read this until a more convenient time.  I was thinking that it should be possible to grab the nearby pages from the indices, at least those which are auto-generated.  This would have a few advantages, I think.  First, I would expect it to be faster, as, from what I can tell, hippietrail's approach actually munches data every time, instead of simply gathering it.  Also, this would keep all the code here, on the one project (as opposed to having to call toolserver).  Finally, this would allow any custom ordering concerns which go into the indices to be represented in the nearby pages.  My skills, while, I think, developing nicely, are still nowhere near up to the task of implementing such a thing, so all I can do is nag you to do it for me.  So, if you have better things to do, obviously feel free to do them instead.  I just thought I'd throw it by you, in case you hadn't already thought of it.  Oh, and when you do have more time, expect me to ambush you sometime on irc and force you to explain some of the stickier points of the translations editor.  You've made some excellent documentation, and so I'm making slow progress on my own, but I expect I'll still need some hand-holding on a few bits.

:Hey. I'm FINISSSHED! so will have time for this stuff as soon as I work out how not to sit around grinning like a maniac all day. I'm on IRC on-and-off depending on what else is up, so should be able to come across each other at some point. The idea behind hippietrail's script is to get all the information at once - and in every language - loading all the indices on pages like [[a]] will take a long time (and you'd still need to guess for languages with no indexes). I did talk to him about re-using the sorting code, but he couldn't find an easy way to integrate it all together, so tries to use the inbuilt locales. (He also does a lot of clever things to try and optimise retrieval of results in a single SQL query, if I remember correctly). I think that it should stay on the toolserver, but that we should probably move it to the [http://toolserver.org/~enwikt wiktionary shared account] so that when it has problems more people (currently just hippietrail and I) can try to fix them (want to join in?). Integrating sorting (and, more importantly I think, inflected-forms removal) from the indexing is definitely possible, but... :). (For what it's worth, the current problem is just that the pages are ISO 8859, but served with a utf-8 content type, I'm not sure whether that was caused by toolserver "upgrading" things or a mistake on hippietrail's part, but I can't edit his files so I can't fix it - I may try creating a clone at /~enwikt/, but he tends to rely on lots of perl modules, and I haven't worked out how to install them properly yet.

Hello Conrad, I think your bot is malfunctioning slightly. It is removing loads of good anagrams.

I suspect that it might have something to do with the fact that these anagram links don't have a #langname piped, because along with these removals I see it adding piped anagrams, but I could be wrong. --[[User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 13:47, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
:Gah. It's because it wasn't supposed to be doing Finnish - but I configured it wrong. Thanks for pointing it out. Should it do anagrams for Finnish in the future - if so how should it deal with ä and Ž etc.? I'll re-set it going with the problem solved, and then find the list of pages to revert.

::Well, if it can, wouldn't it improve Wiktionary? I don't know how it then should handle these letters. I don't speak Finnish and just stumbled upon your bot in action.

== board game piece ==

Hello, Conrad. I noticed that, while mentioning that "board game piece" is not a word, you removed it from a Wikisaurus list.

As you can see, the page [[WS:board game piece]] lists the hyponyms ''draught'' and ''stone'', among other words, which are also hyponyms of [[WS:board game]] and [[WS:game]]. Since I feel that all these WS pages would be rather incomplete without listing such types of game board pieces, I came to at least one possible conclusion: to list "board game piece" as an hyponym of "board game", thus logically resolving my concerns on incompleteness, by having ''draught'' as an hyponym of ''board game piece'', which is an hyponym of ''board game'', which is an hyponym of ''game''.

I've had one or more recent conversations on this subject. [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus_talk:person] As a result, similarly, "beautiful woman" and "ugly woman", despite not being words, are listed as hyponyms of [[WS:woman]].

While I understand that "board game piece" is not a word, I think nonetheless that it should be listed as an hyponym of "board game". --[[User:Daniel.|Daniel.]] 18:24, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
:It seems good to link to the Wikisaurus entry (truth be told, I didn't notice the [Ws] link when I made my edit), but not to link to the dictionary - is there a template for that? I've just hacked it in at the moment, but it might be nicer just to use the link. I'm not sure in what way a "draught" is a hyponym of a "board game", a meronym of the hyponym ("draughts") seems more likely. I was also not sure whether to list pieces or piece, I went for pieces as they are often taken as a unit, on reflection I've updated it to be piece so that the dictionary link is more useful. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 19:21, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
::Hmm, looks like I've mistyped or misunderstood something in my message; let me correct myself and organize my thoughts:
::* You're right, ''draught'' (the piece) is indeed a meronym of ''draughts'' (the game). In addition, ''draught'' is a hyponym of ''board game piece'' (which names [[WS:board game piece|a WS page]]), which is a meronym of ''board game''. Therefore, unless I'm mistaken once again, ''draught'' is also a meronym of ''board game''.
::Then, my suggestion of linking [[WS:board game piece]] to [[WS:board game]] remains. Thanks for readding that link. I agree with you on "piece" being better than "pieces". I believe that a template to link to the WS page but not to the respective dictionary entry does not exist, but may of course be created; although, I'm not sure if we want to standardize the format "[[piece]] &#160; &#160; &#91;[[Wikisaurus:board game piece|Ws]]]", comprised of a link to the dictionary entry which is different from the link to the WS page, because it is apparently not usable to remove the eternal red links from [[WS:woman]]. --[[User:Daniel.|Daniel.]] 20:09, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
:::I think you used hyponym in place of meronym in your first paragraph, it's clear that you meant what seems correct to me. Surely you could just pick one of the synonyms to use? Otherwise you could word the link as [[Wikisaurus:ugly woman|Ws:ugly woman]]? [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 20:18, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
::::On the suggestion of just picking one of the synonyms of [[WS:ugly woman]] to name that page, I have yet another concern: "ugly woman" seems very natural and self-explanatory, unlike [[WS:beldame]], [[WS:brown bagger]], [[WS:hag]], [[WS:harridan]], [[WS:moose]], [[WS:munter]] and [[WS:Sybil]]. Therefore, according to my standards, I couldn't find any synonym good enough to name the page.
::::On the other hand, your suggestion of placing a direct link to Wikisaurus seems good enough to me. Then, I've implemented it in [[WS:beautiful woman]], [[WS:woman]] and [[WS:board game]]. I've chosen the final format "Wikisaurus:ugly woman" to imitate other similar inter-WS links, that exist mainly in <tt>See also</tt> sections. --[[User:Daniel.|Daniel.]] 22:09, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

== {{temp|q}} ==

Hi Conrad. I was reading the more recent comments made in [[WT:RFDO#Template talk:q]]. Michael Z. made a good point (in his post timestamped 2010-04-12 17:46; ¶5): "The use of empty {{temp|q}} is very bad practice. Then when I view the source wikitext the most important word or phrase is omitted. The wikitext breaks silently and permanently if I copy it anywhere else. Doesn't this break Mediawiki's search?" To rectify this, would it be possible to edit the template so that, when the editor writes {{temp|q}} (without defining the first parameter), the template automatically adds the <tt><nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki></tt> (as <tt><nowiki>{{q|PAGENAME}}</nowiki></tt>)? Would prefixing the <tt><nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki></tt> with <tt><nowiki>subst:</nowiki></tt> (as <tt><nowiki>{{subst:PAGENAME}}</nowiki></tt>) achieve that?  — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 22:12, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

:No, I don't think that's possible. We could write a bot to do it every so often - or ask autoformat nicely. I'm currently thinking that any kind of additional mark-up in these quotes is bad, and we should just drop the emphasis altogether, but that may be a heretical view.

:: Yes, I saw that opinion expressed. I personally disagree, but there's no reason we can't accommodate those who think that. [[WT:PREFS]] would allow the formatting that {{temp|q}} applies to be changed however one wished, be it a box, emboldenment, or nothing at all. In the meantime, I'll go ask AF for a favour.  — Raifʻhār Doremítzwr ~ ([[User:Doremítzwr|U]] · [[User talk:Doremítzwr|T]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doremítzwr|C]]) ~ 22:36, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

== Wikisaurus - hyperlinks in ws template ==

You have adjusted {{temp|ws}} so that "{{temp|ws|ugly woman|-}}" renders an item without a hyperlink. This solution is okay, yet imperfect. The second parameter of "ws" is normally used for a gloss, as {{temp|ws|self-evident|Obviously true, and requiring no proof, argument or explanation}}; with your adjustment, the second parameter is overloaded with an additional meaning. It seems to me that "{{temp|ws|ugly woman|nohyperlink<nowiki>=</nowiki>1}}" would be better. What do you think of it? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] 08:23, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
:I think that, in the case there is no link, there should never be a need for a gloss. The solution is similar to how a lot of our other templates work to "get rid of a link", so it's easy to remember. The problem with nohyperlink=1 is that it's not used anywhere else (that I know of), and it's not nolink= nopagelink= or any host of other variants (sure you could make other variants work too, but then the wikitext will be harder to work with automatically). If you're concerned about additional meaning, think of it as an optional second-positional boolean parameter that changes the behaviour of the template to hide the link and gloss, as the gloss would never be "-", it's easy to tell which is intended. I strongly prefer my solution, which is why I did it that way in spite of what you suggested originally, because it is easier to use, understand, and remember. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 09:55, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
:: I strongly dislike your solution. Positional parameters should not be overloaded with meaning. A parameter should not take on a new meaning in a situation in which its main meaning is inapplicable: each meaning should have a dedicated parameter. There is nothing wrong with "nohyperlink" not being used by other templates given that other templates do not have a parameter with this meaning. Your solution is faster to type, but hardly easier to use, understand, and remember. I don't think at all it is easier to understand: it looks as if the intention were to have no gloss, but the effect is to have no hyperlink. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] 12:54, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
::: Your assertion that "positional parameters should not be overloaded with meaning" is demonstrably ignored throughout Wiktionary - other than that, it's a matter of personal taste; I happen to prefer solutions that are easier to remember, use and process over those that are perhaps technically more sound, but I can see where you are coming from. A more tasteful solution might be to create {{temp|ws-only}} for this case, but I don't really see the need. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 14:22, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
:::: I did not know that my assertion was ignored throughout Wiktionary; that is a pity anyway. I would go for "{{temp|ws|ugly woman|nohyperlink<nowiki>=</nowiki>1}}" while creating {{temp|ws only}} as a shortcut for that, given that a shortcut seems required by you, and possibly also by Daniel. ("ws only" instead of "ws-only", on the model of "ws sense" and other Wikisaurus templates.) I really find it hard to accept needless overloading of parameters. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] 14:52, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
::::: You've used {{temp|en-noun}}, surely? Not to mention {{temp|context}}, perhaps the most widespread "offender". Wikitext isn't a programming language, so conventions from there really don't make so much sense. A shortcut is definitely required, or I'll go back to using the much easier to read plain link format that you seem to dislike.

:::::I disagree with the following quote from Dan Polansky: "it looks as if the intention were to have no gloss, but the effect is to have no hyperlink".
:::::Apparently, the intention of {{temp|ws|ugly woman|-}} is to have ''both'' no gloss and no hyperlink. Namely, there are four possibilities:
:::::* {{temp|ws|ugly woman|-}} (no hyperlink and no gloss)
:::::* {{temp|ws|ugly woman}} (hyperlink and no gloss)
:::::* {{temp|ws|ugly woman|abc}} (hyperlink and gloss)
:::::* (then, a gloss and no hyperlink is inapplicable)

== [[Index:Mapudungun]] (copied from archive) == 
Hey again. I was asking Atelaes back in january how to make a index and he mentioned a slow way of doing it and certain magical ways of creating one with the help of a great wizard called Conrad =). I have added alot of words since january and it would be fun to have an index, If you find the time to help me it would be awesome. '''-[[User:Edelstam|Edelstam]] 17:11, 25 March 2009 (UTC)'''

:Hey Conrad, been a while, thanks for updating the mapudungun index again. I can't get on the irc anymore because got this TOR program on my computer and I can't get it to work with some IRC servers. So I'll have to ask you here. I have been working some with trying to start up the mapudungun wikipedia and there they are working with some separate solutions for the different orthographies(what I mistakenly have called alphabets) within one wikipedia. I looked some at the serbian wikipedia where they use two different alphabets for example. I got some comments about the mapudungun language category here on english wiktionary, that it was confusing to have words from two different orthographies in one place. So I was thinking if we could possibly adopt some solutions the serbian language category has here. They have for example a index with the two different alphabets, look [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Index:Serbian here]. Since we only have words in two orthographies it would mean a similar solution to the one the serbian category uses. What do you think about this, is it alot of work? '''-[[User:Edelstam|Edelstam]] 20:14, 26 April 2009 (UTC)'''

::Hi Edelstam, the main problem is automatically telling the two apart. If there is some indication in the page text, or even a way of testing the page titles, that will tell me which alphabet which entry belongs to, then it shouldn't be that hard. I can obviously look for some letters that only appear in one of the alphabets, but I don't know enough about Mapudungun to know if I will always be able to tell the difference.

Right now all words written in the raguileo orthography have this in the article tho: (using Raguileo Alphabet), look at [[cew]] for example. Some words are the same in both orthographies and in those cases they look like this word: [[awka]]. Words written in Unified alphabet look like this: [[chafod]]. Can you use that for the bot?

Right now there are words in the current index written in two different orthographies which are the two top ones in this page [[Appendix:Mapudungun alphabet]]. People has also added words which has not been catogoriesd, so it would possibly be good to have an Index like the serbian index but with link to a page with uncategorised words aswell.

== Chinese Wiktionary parsing ==

I am trying to hire someone to do the same thing you did for the English Wiktionary to extract all the definitions, but for the Chinese Wiktionary (and maybe later the Japanese one). I've looked through the code and it didn't seem too complicated. I was wondering how long it took you to write and how tough it might be for someone else (unfamiliar with Wiktionary) to adapt it to the Chinese Wiktionary. Thanks! [[User:Swiftly|Swiftly]] 19:08, 15 July 2010 (UTC)
:It's not really possible to say how long it took to write, the actual code took a few hours - but I wouldn't have been able to do it so quickly without knowing quite a lot about how the English Wiktionary works and a week or so of finding problems on wiktionary and fixing them. I just had a quick scan through the Chinese Wiktionary, and frankly it looks very scrappy - though the Japanese one may be better. I would imagine you would need a reasonably significant amount of effort to understand the various formats you can find, but the actual extraction of words shouldn't be too hard. I'd be happy to lend advice as you need it, but I'm suddenly much busier than I thought I would be, so I probably can't do the coding (though please use anything I've already written if it helps!). When you get something working, I'd be happy to host it next to the English definition lists (if you want). [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 08:49, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

== Usability Initiative (Vector) Rollout Coming ==

Hi Conrad.Irwin.  I wanted to get in touch with you and a few other members of the Wiktionary community about the upcoming rollout of the Usability Initiative features (Vector and enhanced editing features).  I was referred to you by [[User:ArielGlenn|Ariel]] who thought you might be a good person to reach out to.  We’ve already rolled out the changes to approximately [http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Releases/Default_Switch|100 projects] and are currently planning on rolling out the new features the remaining Wikimedia projects (including Wiktionary) in late August (probably the 4th week).

As I’m sure you know, some gadgets and customizations may not be compatible with Vector.  Would it be possible for you to help us identify the major incompatibilities?  We’re using [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ Bugzilla] to track issues (please file under "Usability Initiative").  Also, our [http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/What%27s_new,_questions_and_answers FAQ page] has info on how to test Vector.

== safesubst: and language templates ==

Hi Conrad,

I was wondering — now that we have your cool <tt>safesubst:</tt> thing, that means we can make language templates do more sophisticated things now, right? IIRC, the main barrier to complicated language templates was that {{temp|subst:nah}} needs to result in bare <tt>[[[[Nahuatl]]]]</tt>, and it used to be impossible to make complicated things disappear during subst-ing but still work during regular transclusion.

This raises the possibility that, for example, {{temp|Xyzy}} could be made obsolete by language templates that know what their corresponding default script templates should be.

What do you think? Is that a reasonable path to go down?

(But now that I think about it, I realize that we could ''always'' have done something like this, by having parallel templates; for example, we could have had {{temp|sc:he}} redirect to {{temp|Hebr}}. So maybe it was intentional that we kept language-templates so limited?)

—[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 14:30, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

:I have not weighed this up in much detail — it sounds like you have a pretty good understanding of what's going on. It's a trade-off between template load-time and template parse-time, making the language templates clever increases parse time on pages that don't want the cleverness. Xyzy tries quite hard to avoid loading extra templates at the expense of increasing parse-times — so making each language template know which script template would increase load-time for invocations that use scripts (each language and script template is needed), and increase parse-time for pages that don't; all to save some parse-time on pages that do — it sounds like it's not going to be a winner overall. Hope that's useful — I'll try and spend some more wiktionary time soon. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 23:19, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

I've found your [http://toolserver.org/~enwikt/definitions/ listdefn project] at toolserver, but I'm unable to achieve your results, create.sh calls a missing latest_dump.sh file. I'm not a power user, but I know something about regex. Can you help me, please? I want to know how to parse Catalan wiktionary, because I want to be able to parse monthly, or yearly, if needed. Thanks in advance. --[[User:Unjoanqualsevol|Unjoanqualsevol]] 13:39, 18 November 2010 (UTC)
:Hi, latest_dump.sh should just print out the file name of a dump file. You can make it as simple as:
 #!/bin/bash
 echo /tmp/cawiktionary-20100912-pages-articles.xml
Let me know if that helps. (Obviously you'll have problems at the moment because http://download.wikimedia.org/ is broken). If you do get something working, I'm happy to try and host it alongside the en.wiktionary ones. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 23:21, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

== Bug in MetaKeywords extension ==

I tried to report this bug using Bugzilla, but the MetaKeywords extension isn't listed. The signature of the wfMetaKeywordClearCache function is incorrect and using the extension with PHP 5.3.5 throws the following error:

Detected bug in an extension! Hook wfMetaKeywordClearCache failed to return a value; should return true to continue hook processing or false to abort.

Backtrace:

== question about transliterator ==

There are a number of Hebrew letter-vowel combinations whose transliterations are ambiguous, so a map for Hebrew would transliterate only a partial repertoire. I had thought that that's no problem: the rest will yield an error. But actually (if I'm not mistaken) the extension will pass a character through untransliterated if there's no rule for the character. That means that either (a) some words will wind up mistransliterated (i.e., including some transliteration and some Hebrew) or (b) one would need to include a dummy target like the null string to transliterate ambiguous things to. Neither looks usable AFAICT. Would it be possible (and I know this is very late in the game) to modify the extension so that it can, as an option (either a parameter in the parser-function tag or, probably better, a flag at the top of the map), yield no transliteration or some specified error when a substring to be transliterated is not in the map?<span class="Unicode">&#x200b;—[[User:Msh210|msh210]]℠</span> ([[user talk:Msh210|talk]]) 17:26, 24 March 2011 (UTC)
:This is not easy to change, unfortunately. How long is the blacklist of characters that can't be transliterated?

== Indexes ==

Hi,

Can I request indexes for Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese and Arabic, please! Also, Korean, Thai, Persian, Vietnamese and Hindi would be nice to have. The current [[Index:Arabic|Arabic index]] is a joke. The [[Index:Japanese|Japanese]] is very small, perhaps should be moved to give space the new one. Perhaps it's fine just to index Chinese and Japanese by the first character, otherwise it may be hard.

Can you do the Korean by the [[jamo]] symbol? Hint: the Hangeul formula is: [{(initial)×588}+{(medial)×28}+(final)]+44032. E.g. {{lang|ko|[[한]]}} is made of three jamo: {{lang|ko|[[ㅎ]]}} + {{lang|ko|[[ㅏ]]}} + {{lang|ko|[[ㄴ]]}} and it's Unicode value is {(18 × 588) + (0 × 28) + 4} + 44032 = 54620. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] 04:50, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

Hi there.
What kind of words are marked with "<partlynew>"?

[http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Index:Polish/l&diff=13039282&oldid=12733151] Why line with 'Lichtenstein' entry was changed from <nowiki> # [[Liechtenstein#Polish|Liechtenstein]] ''proper'' {{audio-list|Pl-Lichtenstein.ogg}} [[Liechtenstein|*]]</nowiki> to <nowiki># <span class="partlynew">[[Liechtenstein]]</span> [[Liechtenstein|*]]</nowiki>? [[User:Maro|Maro]] 20:41, 7 May 2011 (UTC)
:Partlynew means that the index script thinks that the page doesn't exist in that language, or the page is not a lemma. Because the definition reads '<nowiki>{{l|en|Lichtenstein}}</nowiki>', the indexer treats that as a non-lemma entry (assuming that all definitions made up of one template are form-ofs).

== Question/request about language indices. ==

Hi Conrad,

I believe you mentioned once that the language indices don't include entries whose only definitions are entirely template-generated. Would something like this: <pre># {{form of|blah blah|foo}}.</pre> (where the period is outside the template) end up in a language-index? If so, would you be willing to change that?

I ask because people are (once again) discussing standardizing the presentation of form-of templates, and one idea that's been floated is to simplify the dot/no-dot thing by removing the dots entirely, and having them just be tacked on at the end.

Hi Conrad, I was told at the helpdesk that you may be able to help me get a plain-text dump of English words in Wiktionary. Actually, I have since figured out that I can save the HTML from the pages at [[Index:English]], and then strip out just the words. That would be perfect, but now I've noticed that the [[Index:English]] pages do not seem to include noun plurals, verb inflections and so on, which I would like to capture if at all possible.

At the event, MediaWiki developers and Wikimedia operations engineers will be working on Wikimedia's gadgets/extensions/tools support, authorization/authentication strategy, dev-ops virtualization, and general training and hacking.  And we'll improve and discuss the Wikimedia Labs projects infrastructure and other stuff that makes it easier for anyone to supercharge Wikimedia with awesomeness.

The event is open to anyone who wants to come and contribute, and is an opportunity to spend time with senior MediaWiki developers & ops engineers, write beautiful code, and learn about the latest developments.  We'll write code together, discuss the software, and hold little workshops.

If you can make it to New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, 14-16 October 2011, we'd love to have you.  Please [[mw:NOLA_Hackathon#Attendees|add your name to the attendees list]].

== Order of definitions in the definitions dump  ==

Hi Conrad,

The toolserver definitions dump is a great resource, but one thing I've noticed is that the order of the definitions is different to how they appear in Wiktionary. For example, the first two Wiktionary definitions for the noun '''cat''' are '''A domesticated subspecies…''' and '''Any similar animal of the family Felidae…''' whereas in the dump they are '''A catamaran''' and '''A catfish'''. It looks like the dump definitions may have been sorted alphabetically.

Is it possible to get a dump where the definitions are unsorted?

Kind regards, Mike

Mzajac pointed out in [[Thread:User_talk:Yair_rand/editor2.js/Comments|a post]] on the talk page of the definition editor that editor.js's redo button is active even when there's nothing to redo, which could be confusing. It would probably be helpful if the redo button was disabled=disabled when the redostack is empty, and the same for undo and save changed when the editstack is empty. (Also: +poke for looking at the transliterator issues :) ) --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] 18:00, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

== Mandarin and Japanese indexes ==

Hi Conrad,

Can I kindly request Mandarin and Japanese DB dump, similar to [[Index:Russian]], please? Not sure what challenges it may cause, though, and I have no idea how hard it it. I mentioned the idea for the Japanese index in [[Wiktionary:Beer_parlour#Japanese_POS_templates_and_how_entries_are_indexed|BP]]. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] 05:03, 19 September 2011 (UTC)
:Hi Anatoli, Yes — in theory. I have quite a backlog of things to do though. There are some more requests for indexes further up this page as well. I do plan to do them, but I'm not sure when. The more specific you can be about what you want, the easier it will be when I do have time (or for anyone else to pick this up).

::Thanks, Conrad. I guess, I would agree to the simplest possible extract, where entries are indexed by their first character, be it kana or kanji symbol, words in Romaji (Roman letters) could be excluded, they are duplications of other words, anyway. In case of Mandarin, only hanzi (Chinese chracters) words, please. When you have time to do, please let me know if there are some possible variants or if you have questions. --[[User:Atitarev|Anatoli]] 22:28, 19 September 2011 (UTC)

== Old Germanic languages to be indexed ==

What would be needed to allow other languages to be indexed as well? Could indexing be added for Old Norse, Old and Middle High German, Old Saxon, Middle Low German, Old and Middle Dutch, Old Frisian and Gothic (in Gothic script with romanization)? I don't know if this is hard to do, and whether the work is worth it for these languages that don't have many entries yet. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 17:23, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

:In theory its as simple as adding alphabets to the bot script — if you could make the copy-pasteable, I'm happy to give that a go. 
:It's also useful to know which letters are only considered different at the second-degree (i.e.  a < ä, but äb < ac). (And whether or not the language counts ä as a different letter, or just a modified a). [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 05:36, 16 November 2011 (UTC)
:: All of those languages except for Gothic and Old Norse used the medieval Latin alphabet, consisting of Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii/Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu/Vv/Ww Xx Yy Zz. I don't think I and J were considered separate letters, or U, V and W, but for modern purposes it's probably best to treat them separately. In Middle Dutch, J was written instead of I when it appeared after another I, so II was written IJ. The other languages probably did similarly as well, although I don't know for sure. Vowel length is written with macrons on Wiktionary but it's not part of the entry names.
:: For Old Norse, the alphabet is similar to that of modern Icelandic: Aa Áá Bb Dd Ðð Ee Éé Ff Gg Hh Ii Íí Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Óó Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Úú Vv Xx Yy Ýý Þþ Ææ Œœ Øø Ǫǫ, but this is the standard 'normalised' alphabet, in the original writing J was not distinguished from I, nor was V from U, KV was often written QU as in Latin, and I don't think vowel length was marked either. I'm not sure what the proper ordering of the last four letters should be either. The letter Ęę also appears sometimes but I don't think it's part of the regular normalisation, it's often replaced with Ee.
:: Gothic used its own alphabet, which is detailed at [[Wiktionary:Gothic transliteration]]. A vote has decided to allow romanized entries in Gothic, so it would probably be good to have two indexes for Gothic: one in the Gothic alphabet (with its ordering) and one with the Latin alphabet (Aa Bb Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Ww Xx Zz Þþ Ƕƕ). Like in the other languages, macrons are used to indicate long vowels but these are not part of the entry names.

== Insular glyph characters ==

I wonder if we might want to note that, in addition to being unnecessary, the use of the insular characters is technically incorrect in this context. They're included in Unicode for use as phonetic characters, but in actual Old English texts, they'd be nothing more than glyph variants of their respective letters (g, r, s, etc.) and thus should be represented by the corresponding "ASCII" characters. This seems like a potentially relevant note, as the relationship is somewhat different than that between ƿ and w. —[[User:Leftmostcat|Leftmostcat]] 01:46, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

*I'm not sure exactly what the question is.

(It couldn't be done from just one input though.) The only reason I never did that myself is just because I'm not really any good with templates. If anyone wants to make them I'm happy to explain what's needed though. Also, I should note that some verbs (generally classed as "anomolous") are completely unpredictable and at least one, [[beon-wesan]], even has two parallel paradigms. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx">[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 13:05, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

== Standard dialect/further standardization?  ==

I think the West Saxon dialect has ''de facto'' been treated as the "standard" lemma dialect. However it may be worthwhile to codify this so we can simply link different dialects as alt-form entries to a single main lemma. Compare for example the situation at [[ælc]]/[[ealc]] right now; it's kind of muddled. It would be nice to have a standardization scheme like the one [[WT:AGOH|Old High German]] has, especially w/ regards to vowels which differ quite a bit between dialects, to make the spellings of main lemma entries predictable for users and to allow us to unify lemmas in one place as opposed to spread over various dialectal forms. (Of course we should absolutely have entries for dialectal forms, it's just nice to not have info shared between all dialect spread all over the place between these various dialect entries.)

This template is used to create the headword-line of an Old English verb. It takes the following parameters:

* <tt>head=</tt> (optional) — the headword to display. By default, the template just displays the current page-name, but <tt>head=</tt> can be used, for example, to display a macron over a long vowel.
* <tt>sort=</tt> (optional) — the sort-key for ordering in categories. By default, the template just sorts using the current page-name, but <tt>sort=</tt> can be used when special ordering is required.

== Sense referentials and links ==

One of this project's major shortcomings is that we have no way to reference individual definitions.  When I write an entry for [[[[ἐπί]]]], I have no way of specifying which sense of [[[[over]]]] I mean.  Granted, some have used short glosses after the referenced word ([[over]] (on top of, above)), but this suffers from a few problems.  First of all, it's messy.  The first definition of [[ἐπί]] references four English words as its definition, and including glosses for all four would make for a mess of text.  Also, it's inconsistent.  I could just as easily say "[[over]] (on top of)" or [[over]] (On top of; above; higher than; further up).  These three glosses would all be intended to mean the same thing, and yet they're clearly different, and consequently possibly misleading.  However, the biggest problem, in my view, is that they're semantically referential instead of technically referential.  What I mean by that is that a person can probably parse such a gloss (albeit with the difficulties already mentioned) and use it to identify which sense is meant, but a computer program cannot.  A smart computer program can take educated guesses, and I know Conrad has already done some work which is fairly good at it.  But I think that we really need to make it so that a stupid program can parse it.  One such program that really needs to be able to parse it is Wiktionary itself, so that a person can link a word in a definition and the link will send the user straight to that particular definition.  We can already link to a specific language section of an entry (i.e. [[over#Latin]]), but we need to be able to link to a specific sense (i.e. [[over#English#On top of]]), which we cannot currently do.  This is an issue which has been bothering me for some time, but I have failed to come up with a concrete proposal for a solution.  However, I have recently been in contact with [http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/research/software/jwktl one of our downstream users], who noted this deficiency as one of their primary challenges in using our data, and so was spurred into bringing this here, to see if anyone has any brilliant ideas. 

Now that the problem has been presented, some more technical thoughts on the matter:  I had toyed with the idea of a simple list based reference system, such as sense 1 simply be referred to and linked to as [[over#English#1]] or something like that.  However, the obvious problem with that is that our definitions are constantly being added to, deleted, merged, shuffled about, and so on, and so such a system would very quickly become a maintenance nightmare.  The decision I've come to is that a gloss based system is ideal, for a few reasons.  First, such a system would tolerate shuffling quite well, and would likely degrade gracefully as our definitions change over time.  Also, it is similar to, and consequently is easily interconverted with, the various forms already in use, both in entries which use a word as a definition, as has already been mentioned, and within the entry itself, such as in synonyms and translations.  If we could figure out a way to encode an "official" gloss into every definition, and encode that official gloss into links, and teach Wiktionary to put the two together, I think it would work.  By encoding the gloss into the definition itself, we produce a specific target for references, and an official standard that editors can follow.  One problem with this system that Conrad noted is that it would take a lot of work.  If we have to encode an official gloss into every definition, and no definitions currently have them, then we have a lot of definitions which have to have some info added to them.  However, I think that we could get a very large start on the problem with automation.  Since a great many of our entries have glosses already written for them, such as in the translation tables, a reasonably intelligent program could scour entries with translation tables and synonym sections, find the glosses, attempt to match up definitions with their glosses, and then encode those glosses into the definitions, were we to come up with a suitable paradigm for this.  Granted, this would still leave a great many entries without sense encoded glosses, but it probably would cover most of our important English definitions, which is arguably the area where they are most needed.  As for the linking method, I guess I don't know exactly how the MW program does section links, and so am unclear as to how this could be modified.  If anyone knows what the methodology is, posting it here would be appreciated.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 00:36, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

::Jeez, long post :p. Links are done by the browser moving the top of the window to level with &lt;a> elements with matching name="" parameters, or to elements with matching id="" parameters. MediaWiki does this (for headings) by running the contents of the heading through a HTML-stripper and then an encoder to make links that "just work" for humans. You can see how to hook into this by looking at {{temp|jump}} (a similar idea to yours).
::People already complain at having to include the glosses in translations tables - let alone including it with the definition too. That said, a tool like [[User:Yair rand/newentrywiz.js]] could easily propagate the gloss all over the entry (at creation time, and just force people never to update the glosses?). Generating new glosses from definitions is really hard (probably [[AI complete]]) - I thought about trying for [[:Category:Translation table header lacks gloss]], and haven't yet worked out anything approaching a workable heuristic - so that at least will need to be done by humans.
::With no further editing work: for those with javascript enabled I had intended, in the near future, to add a PREF that highlights the linked to definition (and/or the definition associated with translations/synonyms etc. on appropriate user interaction) [by copying the gloss from nearby into the link, and then fuzzy matching on page load]. For consumers, I can then publish this algorithm, and provide lists (along the lines of [http://toolserver.org/~enwikt/definitions]) that match definitions to glosses. This leaves our javascript disabled users at a disadvantage, but it would be possible to add this as a MediaWiki extension if it works, so that it works for everyone. (Hey, we could even get it to colour bad gloss links differently :p). [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 01:11, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I would have thought that for ''most'' cases, a human-acceptable gloss can be generated by taking the text of the definition up to the first semicolon or period, and removing any initial article for noun defs or initial "to" for verb defs.

::::Yeah, I was kind of thinking that too, although if there already is a human added gloss in a transtable or something, then we'd prefer that.  The trick really is, assuming we can figure out glosses one way or another, at least in some situations, how can we take that gloss and make it work as a technical reference to the sense?  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 08:14, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

I believe that a link to [[Wikisaurus:tooth]] should appear automatically at [[Wikisaurus:person]]. However, it didn't.

If it's doing a check to see whether condition A or condition B exists and to do different things in each case, it might be better to make separate templates that don't need to do this check?

:::::Capitalization support has just been added to the Commons version: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-HotCat.js&oldid=40521250]. It doesn't capitalize the first letter anymore here at wiktionary; tested through the import in my [[User:Lupo/monobook.js|monobook.js]]. As to category sorting: I presume that is meant to apply for the actual edits made through this gadget. If someone could explain how this is supposed to work (I don't know your conventions at all), I could probably devise some extension mechanism by which you could just plug in a function that would determine the position where a new category should be inserted. Note that if a category is replaced, the current HotCat just inserts the new category at the place where the old category was. Maybe that behavior would also need to be overrideable here... take a look at function <code>change_category</code> and there in particular the <code>cat_point</code> handling. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 10:36, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::Category sorting works like this: all categories for English words need to go at the end of the English section and before the <code><nowiki>----</nowiki></code> that separates the language sections if there is one (and likewise for other languages). See [[Malta]] for an example, where the German section looks like this:
<pre>==German==
{{wikipedia|lang=de}}

===Proper noun===
'''Malta''' {{n}}

# [[#English|Malta]]

====Derived terms====
* [[maltesisch]]
* [[Malteser]]
* [[Malteserin]]

[[Category:German proper nouns]]
[[Category:de:Countries]]
[[Category:de:Islands]]

----</pre>
::::::Note that there is no <code><nowiki>----</nowiki></code> at the end of the very last language section. Editors also sometimes leave it out, but we have a bot, {{user|AutoFormat}}, that adds it in after a while. —'''[[User:Internoob|Internoob]]''' ([[User talk:Internoob|Disc]]•[[Special:Contributions/Internoob|Cont]]) 17:25, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Oof. I could probably provide a hook so that you could try to write your own placement function, but writing such a function is not going to be easy with this layout. First, not all categories related to German start with "Category:de:"&mdash;in your example, there is already "German proper nouns". (BTW, the "----" doesn't seem to be necessary; using "=="-headings as the separators should also work.) Second, there'd need to be a (hard-coded?) table mapping section titles ("English", "German", and so on) to language prefixes ("en", "de") and/or vice versa. I see no way to infer the mapping from the wikitext source. Third, English appears to have no prefix at all? (Well, there is "enm"... what is that?) Fourth, one would need to consider what to do with category replacements that change the language prefix. Should replacing "Category:de:Islands" by "Category:cs:Islands" be allowed or not? <small>(Anyway, I have trouble understanding the reason for this split. If applied consistently, you'll end up with "Malta" in a multitude of "lang:Islands" categories. It's an island regardless of the language... Why do the contents of [[:Category:de:Islands]] and [[:Category:cs:Islands]] differ e.g. in the "M" section? Why is "Malta" not in category cs:Islands, and Mallorca not in de:Islands? Also, a "proper noun" very often is a "proper noun" in many languages. It seems silly to me to categorize it as "English/Finnish/Galician/German/Italian/Norwegian/Polish/Serbo-Croatian/Slovene/Spanish proper noun"&mdash;and you left out Dutch/Estonian/Slovak/Swedish... well, you probably have a reason to do it that way...)</small> Anyway, if such a replacement is allowed, shall the new category be inserted at the place where the old category was? Or in the "Czech" section? What if there isn't a "Czech" section yet? And if it should not be allowed at all, some more hooks would be needed such that language prefixes cannot be changed in the input, and wouldn't even appear in the suggestion lists.
:::::::Frankly said, I don't think it's worth trying to code a placement function that tried to account for all this. It'd be rather fragile, slow, and full of special cases. I'd propose, at least as a start, something simpler: disable auto-commit in HotCat, forcing a human review of all changes. The human operator then can easily fix misplaced categories as HotCat always edits the whole page, not just a section. Humans are so much better in dealing with irregular structures than computers... [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 23:09, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

::::::::I can imagine that this would be hard to program. We do, however, have templates for almost all of the language codes ({{temp|de}} produces "German", for example) and codes can be turned into names with the {{temp|language}} template. The part of speech categories take the full language names by convention and the topical categories take language codes, except English, which takes no prefix for topical categories (enm is Middle English). The only exceptions are categories with "derivations"; e.g. [[:Category:French derivations]], which is for English words derived from French. I can't imagine why someone would want to change the language prefix, unless someone confused their languages somewhere along the way or forgot the prefix entirely, but if they did, it would have to go under the new section. (The reason why we segregate categories by language is that they're more useful/interesting that way. If we jumbled all the languages together, we'd end up with massive categories in which it would be hard to find words of a particular language. [[Malta]] should ideally be in every category (islands, countries, proper nouns) that pertains to it in each of the languages, the reason why it isn't is because categorizing things is a very tedious job, and editors often neglect to do it.) If there's a category for a language section that isn't there, it should probably be either disallowed or added to the end with some sort of a cleanup notice.

:::::::::Well, templates like {{temp|de}} or {{temp|language}} don't help much. A JavaScript doesn't know what they expand to; it would have to make extra API requests to get them in expanded form. I'd really go with disabling auto-commit and fixing placement errors by hand. If someone modifies the local HotCat copy such that it does the placement as is needed here, we can then consider how to factor this code out into appropriate hooks, and then change the Commons "master" version to provide these hooks. Just ping me (preferably over at the Commons) when anything like that is ready. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 07:34, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

(unindent) Thinking a little more, I think the simplest solution would be for HotCat to add new categories at the end of the page, and add a {{temp|rfc-auto}} to trigger AF to do the sorting. Slightly more complicated would be:
*If there are other categories on the page with the same prefix or first word as the category being added, then place the new category on the line above or below that one (depending on alphabetical order).
*If there are no other categories with the same prefix or first word, place at the end of the page, and add {{temp|rfc-auto}}
:for example, if the added category is [[:Category:French verbs]], sort with other categories starting "Category:French" if they exist, otherwise add to the bottom of the page. The same for e.g. [[:category:fr:Flowers]] - sort with other "Category:fr:" lines. However [[:category:French verbs]] wouldn't auto-sort with [[:Category:fr:Flowers]] (until AF turned up).
For modifications of categories:
*If the prefix or first word of the old and new categories are the same, leave where they are
*If the prefix or first word is not the same, then do follow the process for new categories.

What I would like to do is, first get a separate list of ''all words'' appearing in each dictionary, second, boil those individual lists down to words that are missing from Wiktionary, and third, group those words by the number of these dictionaries they appear in (along with some notation of which dictionaries contain them). Presumably, a word that is missing from Wiktionary, but appears in all five of these dictionaries, should be a high priority to add, while a word that appears in only one of these dictionaries is more likely to be obscure, or a scanno.

== NavHead height ==

Our CSS specs currently set the height of the NavHead (the visible portion of the NavBar) to 1.6em.  This prevents any content present from wrapping.  Up til now, this hasn't been a problem, as the sole contents of the thing were the gloss and the show/hide button.  However, I am running into problems with [[User:Atelaes/Customization/Translations|my customized translation script]] in regards to this.  In certain cases, when a language has a very long translation, or multiple translations, the last bit can get clipped.  Additionally, I've been toying with the idea of allowing multiple languages.  Would anyone have a problem if we changed this specification from "height: 1.6em" to "min-height: 1.6em;", which would keep it at this height, but allow for more if needed?  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 12:55, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

::They actually don't affect the statistics, ever since Autoformat started adding {{temp|count page}} to entries. The links break all section links unless the section is deliberately specified inside the link (<nowiki>[[foo#English|foo]]</nowiki>). <tt><nowiki>{{plural of|[[foo]]}}</nowiki></tt> or <tt><nowiki>{{plural of|[[foo]]|lang=es}}</nowiki></tt> would just link to the page, but <tt><nowiki>{{plural of|foo}}</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>{{plural of|foo|lang=es}}</nowiki></tt> would link to English and Spanish sections, respectively. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 02:59, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

== Show all hidden content  ==

In preparation for the site-wide rollout of "Hidden Quotes", I've been thinking about its interaction with other elements already in play.  Some users have expressed concerns about hidden content in general, and I've been thinking about how to address them.  I was wondering what people's thoughts would be on creating a universal "show" button in the toolbar, to replace the "show all quotes" button currently added by Hidden Quotes.  This would allow users a quick and efficient way to display all hidden content on the screen, including quotes, translations, inflections, and anything else which we might build hiding capabilities into in the future.  To make this scalable, I was thinking that it would be better to have the "show all" function simply send out an intent, and have each JS piece which does hiding have its own hide/show all function which responds to it.  However, this would involve some relatively advanced coding (truth be told, I'm not quite sure how to do it off the top of my head), and it might simply be easier to have it call each item's "hide/show all" function itself.  We'd then have to add each item to the master list whenever we create them.  Admittedly, we don't have that many hiding scripts currently.  Thoughts?  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 01:25, 16 June 2010 (UTC)
:I'd prefer categorized shows to be honest - I'm never interested in translations, but sometimes in quotations. I suggest creating a function so that: <code>toggle.onclick = registerVisibilityToggle(category<String>, show<function(e)>, hide<function(e)>)</code> can be used, and we can then have category's "translations", "quotations", "inflections" et.al. We could then make this a toolbox in its own right, or use a bar at the top of the entry like the OED. I'm planning to rewrite the NavBar stuff in the next few days so that my latest project (accelerated translation tables) can work properly. If you'd like me to give this a go at the same time, I'm happy to. [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad]].[[User_talk:Conrad.Irwin|Irwin]] 10:42, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

:::This is now done, and below is the (slightly [[beta reduced]]) snippet of code that the translations tables use. The category name is displayed verbatim in the Visibility toolbox.

== IPA symbol ɡ ==

Why do some entries use the 'IPA symbol' (if it is one) ɡ rather than the standard Unicode Latin 'g'. Are the actually different? Until recently I've always seen the Latin letter g used, but we have ɡ on our toolbar. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 13:40, 22 June 2010 (UTC)
:They are actually different and the IPA {{IPAchar|ɡ}} should always be used in IPA transcriptions (and also the rhymes template). The IPA character is always rendered as an "opentail" ɡ (image: [[File:Opentail g.svg|10px]]) whereas the Latin character can be rendered as an opentail or "looptail" g (image: [[File:Looptail g.svg|10px]]) depending on the font. As the Latin character is not a valid IPA symbol, it should be possible to bot replace it with the IPA character. Because of the visual similarity though (the standard Wiktionary font renders both as opentail) we can expect the Latin character to continue being added by users who don't know the difference, so it might be worth making this an AF task.

:::I would have to assume that IPA's "rejection", as you, Martin, call it, of Latin ''g'' was not their intent at all.

Could anyone here possibly help me create a noun template for !Xóõ? I was using Tswana's existing noun template as a base (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Template:tn-noun) but I'm scared I'll end up messing something up. I need a template with which I can list for every noun its plural, diminutive, diminutive plural, tone class (1-2) and noun class (1-5). Can anyone help me to do this? I'd be so grateful! Perhaps diminutive plural can be left out if that would be too cumbersome. [[User:Xoolanguage|Xoolanguage]] 21:46, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

:{{temp|nmn-noun}} now takes 5 parameters- tone_class, noun_class, pl, dim, and dim_pl. It would be a good idea to create some kind of appendix for !Xóõ nouns so that tone class and noun class can be linked to there from the template. [[User:Nadando|Nadando]] 22:04, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
:: (@Nadando) Wow! Thank you so much! It's perfect! It feels like Christmas now! :) Could you possibly explain what you mean by creating an appendix for the nouns, though? I apologise for being so ignorant. I am still learning the ins and outs of wiktionary. [[User:Xoolanguage|Xoolanguage]] 00:47, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
::: The numbers by themselves don't mean anything the way I coded the template, which is why I suggested linking them to a page which explains the various classes. See {{temp|ro-verb}} and the accompanying [[Appendix:Romanian fourth conjugation]]. [[User:Nadando|Nadando]] 02:21, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
:::: Thank you! I was successful in making some appendices. [[User:Xoolanguage|Xoolanguage]] 18:45, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

I have another question though, for anyone to answer if they can. I notice on the !Xóõ noun category page (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:!X%C3%B3%C3%B5_nouns), there are a lot of links to noun pages that have since been deleted, and that the page is also for some reason not displaying a lot of nouns, such as for example !ùm (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/!%C3%B9m) which is categorised as being a !Xóõ noun but does not show up in the category. So basically the page is displaying what it shouldn't and not displaying what it should. Can any of this be fixed? [[User:Xoolanguage|Xoolanguage]] 18:45, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
: That's strange. The problem seems to have fixed itself. Perhaps I was just looking at an old cache for some odd reason. Nevermind! [[User:Xoolanguage|Xoolanguage]] 18:48, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
:: Wiktionary does some caching on the server side, so this sort of thing happens a lot. And it has a lot of servers, so if a series of requests goes to different servers, the glitch might look like it goes away and comes back and goes away again. Categories, specifically, seem to be the worst offenders.

== Dangling tea-room templates ==

Copied from: [[User_talk:Bequw#Dangling_tearoom_templates]]:


Per my most recent comment at [[WT:BP#Archiving]], there are (probably) lots of tea room templates lying around the main namespace long after the discussion has ended. Sorting this out should be possible in two stages - find them and delete them:

# Generate a list of all main namespace pages that link to Wiktionary:Tea room
# Compare the list with the subject headers currently on the tea room page, removing from the list any that match
# Pass the list to a bot, AWB or other automated process
# Remove any instances of {{temp|rft}}, {{temp|rft-sense}} and {{temp:tearoom}} on the page
# Make a note of the list somewhere so when someone clever than me works out how to find the old discussions in the archive they can be linked to from the article talk page. 

I'm asking you, because I don't have the skills necessary to do this and your work with cf(r) -> compare indicates that you do. [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 00:38, 25 June 2010 (UTC) 
:How would we know that someone didn't add the template to the entry, but forgot to create the TR section? [[user:Bequw|Bequw]]?
::Hmm, if the template was added recently (say within the last week) we should probably drop a note on the talk page of the user who added the template. Other than that we should just get rid of it, if can be added again after all. I say this because we can't know why the template was added. It's not like an rfv where it's clear what is being asked, and especially on large entries listing it on the rft page without will not lead to much (if anything) more useful than "huh?". 
::We could parse the archives and see if there is a match to the title there, but I don't know much effort that would be (there would only be a need to look in the archive covering the period ~4 months after the tag was placed if that helps). We could list any that don't match separately, and try and figure out why they were listed, however I'm not sure how successful we'd be with that (per my previous paragraph).

== Tabbed language browsing ==

New option at [[WT:PREFS]].  Feedback, bugs wanted.  [[yada yada yada|yada yada]].  To clarify, this was not my idea.  hippietrail did it on wiktdev, and Conrad.Irwin did it on Paper View.  However, my version might well be the prettiest I've seen, especially if you're using Vector, where I've appropriated their tab format.  However, my CSS is not terribly strong, so any help with making it even prettier is welcome.  Also, a few folks who were using hidden quotes before it was pushed site wide might have it fed to them without their consent.  To any who suffered this, I sincerely apologize.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 08:35, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Ok, overlap and section specific linking problems should be taken care of.  Crushed edit section, however, is still crushed (I am just so inept at CSS).

:::::::Again, I apologize for what must have been a rather jarring experience.  The issue is that all the preferences at WT:PREFS are numerically encoded, and if we don't reuse numbers dead space accumulates in the cookie.  I now realize that I should have simply waited for a month after the number was last used to avoid this problem.  I am somewhat perplexed by your complaints about the interface, and would greatly appreciate any clarification you can give.  The removal of the table of contents is not strictly necessary, but I thought it beneficial.  With tabbed languages you're not seeing nearly as much content at a time, and the utility of the table of contents is thus diminished.  Since it ate up a lot of space at a place where space was now more needed, especially in entries with many languages, I gave it the axe.  I'm not quite sure how to interpret the complaint of "loss of content space on the landing page".  For the vast majority of entries, the initial page should hold just as much content as before, as the tabs should all fit onto the initial L2 header.  I've looked at a few translingual entries, and the tabs all show up at the top, just like they are supposed to on every page.  If you could give me a link to a problematic page, I'd very much like to see what's happening.  Finally, while I do think that aesthetics are important, the primary point of this script was usability and parsability.  It was intended to make entries easier to navigate.  If you could elaborate on how this is costly to users, it would help me out immensely, as I am utterly at a loss to see it.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 21:23, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

::::::::For my personal "[[use case]]s": I use/edit almost entirely English. Almost all the edits I do below the English section involve correcting structure problems. I use the hidden categories to find which language section has the structure problem and the ToC to get to the section for very long entries. For shorter entries I use the ToC directly to identify the structure problems. IOW, TOC saves me time. I'm sure I could get used to a new interface> (They say you get used to hanging, too.)

:::::::::Ah, I can see how, if tweaking header levels is a common task of yours, the lack of the TOC could be problematic.  Yes, the TOC does not work well with tabbed languages, as, in an important way, much of the content that it refers to is no longer there, and thus can't be linked to.  Putting the TOC back in (floated right) I now see some cases where the tabs end up well below where they should.  I must admit I removed the TOC before I did my more thorough testing, and thus missed that issue.  The tabs do, admittedly, take up more space when there are a lot of languages, or when the user is viewing the site on a very narrow monitor (and the problem is exacerbated when the two coincide).  As for the future of the feature, there are currently no plans of any kind.  I quickly grow more and more tired of trying to implement improvements to the site's interface, as nearly everyone seems convinced that our current setup is perfect.  I think that I will resign myself to creating and improving my own interfaces.  If people like them and want to implement them, either for themselves or for the site as a whole, then more power to them.  However, creating consensus on these issues is a task I have lost my liking for.  In any case, I strongly suspect that if anyone intends to push this feature site-wide, they will announce it on the BP at the very least, and you will have ample warning beforehand.  In the meantime, it might be easiest to simply uncheck the box on WT:PREFS and go about your business.  Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 23:56, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::::I don't know how this would strike non-contributing users, whether or not cursed with being accustomed to the way things have been.

::::::::::I don't think that many people (if anyone) thinks our current interface is perfect, in that they think it cannot be improved. The difficulty in improving it comes from the fact that there is no agreement on what is good and what is bad. This probably comes from the fact that there are so many different tasks we do, and so many different ways of doing things that we each have our own perspective on what works and what doesn't. Because of the way I personally interact with the site, I want to be able to see at a glance an overview of what an entry contains and to be able to jump to any part of the article with a single click - so for me the current numbered TOC at the top of a single page containing everything is ideal. For you it's obviously not, and that is equally valid. Part of the problem with developing new interfaces is that when existing functionality is removed (and this is especially true of the Vector skin) through ignorance of what others do. What may be so trivial to one person as to go unnoticed might be at the heart of what someone else does. [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 00:34, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

:::I moved your comment here, so as to facilitate any continuing conversation with DCDuring.  I hope I was not overly bold in doing so.  The TOC of contents is, in fact, hidden by this feature.  However, that hiding is overridden by having the right-side-TOC preference checked in [[Special:Preferences]].  I think that, in most cases, the TOC is rendered useless by this feature, however, if everyone is up in arms about it, I may change that.  I'm not positive that this will work properly on every page, but my intention was to make the tabs line up with the initial L2 header, so as to give the visual illusion that there is a single L2 header on the page, which now contains every language, instead of just one.  However, the tabs are floated left, and I can see how they might be improperly offset by images on the right, above the initial L2.

You mentioned section specific links above, but they still seem to be broken- [[go#Czech]], [[go#Czech|go]], {{l|cs|go}}, all just take me to the bottom of English. [[User:Nadando|Nadando]] 02:03, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

:Ah...after trying it a few times I see what's happening.  Basically, it's a function of how quickly everything happens.  There are a number of things which happen when the page is loaded, and they appear to be variable in the order that they happen.  The relevant things which are happening include the following: 1. the html engine is building all the content based on the html, 2. the JS is looking at the html, sorting it into language sections, 3. the JS hides all the language sections except the first one, 4. the JS looks at the hash target (in this case, it's #Czech), looks to see if there is a language section which matches that hash, and if there is presses the button to switch to that section (to unhide it, and hide everything else), and finally 5. the html engine looks to see if there is an element with an id matching the hash, figures out how far down it is on the page, and scrolls down that far.  

:Now, ideally, everything happens in that order.  If it does, the page functions as expected.  You arrive to see the Czech section.  However, if #5 happens before #4, then the JS still switches to the Czech section, but the window has already scrolled way down, so you're looking at a bunch of dead space below the Czech section.  I wonder if, perhaps if #5 happens really early, it throws away the hash target, and the JS consequently doesn't have access to it, and consequently can't switch to the right section (in which case you're looking at the bottom of the English section).  I'll have to do some investigation, and see if I can get the script to disable the window's native hash processing, to fix this.  However, I also notice that clicking the <nowiki>[[go#English]]</nowiki> link in the Czech def does not switch over to the English section like it should.  So.....I suppose I'll need an event listener or something.  Give me some time, and I'll work on this.

: It would be nice to act on Point (1). On point (2) if I understand your suggestion - wouldn't the LH margin become very ragged if quotations were very short ? —[[User:Saltmarsh|<font color="green">Saltmarsh</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:Saltmarsh|απάντηση]]</sup> 14:57, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

::Non-breaking space is in place (let me know if it doesn't work for some reason).  For future reference, I do believe that all site-wide javascript written by us is at [[Mediawiki:Common.js]] .  I would argue against making the buttons right aligned, as I think users with wider monitors would have trouble lining the buttons up with their defs, as well as simply being more apt to overlook them entirely.  -[[User:Atelaes|Atelaes]] <small>[[User talk:Atelaes|λάλει ἐμοί]]</small> 15:03, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Yes, I take the point about wide monitors. Is lining up with the right hand edge of the text if on a second line possible? My thinking is that when the entire def and [quotations ▼] fit on one line the latter is towards the right hand end of the line. When the latter is wrapped onto a second line it's towards the left. For my preference it would be good if it were consistently at the right hand end of the line - does that make sense?

== {{temp|IPAchar}} in translation tables ==

In my almost totally futile attempt to use {{temp|t}} instead of bracketed links <nowiki>[[]]</nowiki> or script templates in translation sections, a lot of Arabic translations use {{temp|IPAchar}}. I assume these should be removed, they don't seem to be transliterations. In short, information in translation tables should be kept to a minimum - this is why foreign language words are allowed their own entries, with pronunciations, etymologies, inflections (etc.) Trying to get all that into just a translation table would make the actual translations hard to find. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 12:01, 29 June 2010 (UTC)
:{{Temp|IPAchar}} is used a lot more widely that it really should as there are better templates for almost everything it is used for in the main namespace (usage notes in pronunciation sections being about the only exception I can think of, and even then there are sometimes better ways). Removing them from the translation tables has my support, especially as some of the times I've seen them used they don't even appear to be pronunciaitions. Where they do appear to be pronunciations, and there is no pronunciation section on the entry for the Arabic word, then you might want to create such a section and wrap them in a <nowiki>{{rfv-pronunciation|/blah/|lang=ar}}</nowiki> template. [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 13:44, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

== Quotation templates ==

2 things:
# I noticed that {{temp|quote-book}} displays ed. or eds. for the '''editor''' parameter- can this be expanded to editor / editors?
# Is there consensus to add a translation parameter? I see little use in citing non-English works in the English Wiktionary without a translation. [[User:Nadando|Nadando]] 05:57, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

I agree with both of those suggestions, they should also be added to {{temp|quote-news}}, {{temp|quote-book}} and the translation parameter to {{temp|quote-newsgroup}} (no need for an editor there). I also noticed that the volume parameter of {{temp|quote-book}} is not displaying anything (volume_plain is, so it might be from when that was added a short while ago). [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 08:36, 30 June 2010 (UTC)
:Abbreviations expanded. All the quote templates (except {{temp|quote-us-patent}}) accept ''translation='' now ({{temp|quote-book}} actually already did).

Unfortunately, clicking a different language doesn't give the same images with their translations.  Also I think a picture dictionary / visual dictionary is more than a collection of images.  Looking up "house" should give more than pictures of houses, but a house's component parts, e.g. the various rooms, the garage, the roof, garden, stairs, doors and windows etc. It seems to me all the raw material is already available: images on commons, definitions and translations on Wiktionary, more details on Wikipedia, but a picture dictionary presents the information in a different way.   Do you guys think this is more appropriate over on Wikicommons that here on Wiktionary? [[Special:Contributions/83.134.216.150|83.134.216.150]] 16:48, 30 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::::::It does really fall between the projects - we've got the infrastructure for definitions, translations, synonyms, etc but we're not really set up to handle large (numbers of) images. Similarly Commons is designed around the management and display of lots of pictures and has limited translations support, but I don't imagine that all the other dictionary functions would go over well there. Perhaps it might work as a dedicated Wiktionary - picture.wiktionary.org or somesuch. However this would need high-level approval (Foundation level I guess, but I don't know) and how well you'd get the critical mass of editors needed to make it worthwhile I don't know.

Simply because they are used and valid forms. The bigger question is why would they be left out? The 1-3rd person plural forms appear far more in extant texts then the 2nd plural (which is included in the current template). —[[User: Ganymede |Ganymede]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ganymede |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 10:08, 6 January 2011  

: Your phrase "the 2nd plural (which is included in the current template)" is not quite right: the current template includes ''the'' plural, and it happens to end up alongside the second-person singular, but it's not intended as a second-person plural, specifically.
: You write as though there are separate plural forms for each person, but the creator of this template clearly didn't believe that to be the case, and [[[[w:Old English morphology]]]] doesn't support that position either. Do you have any evidence for it?
: —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 15:44, 6 January 2011 (UTC)

You're absolutely right. This was partially a silly mistake on my part, one of my grammar books listed them separately and then I misread a "1-3rd person" as "1,3rd person." My real issue is a little nit-picky. I still find it a touch strange and/or misleading that the plural form of the verb appears in the 2nd person column. If only because I am confident in saying that the plural verb appears more commonly alongside and in reference to the 3rd person plural pronouns than any others. I'll have to do a bit more research to pull out some evidence of that though.

: Well, it's not really ''in'' the second-person row . . . I mean, it is, physically, but only because that's the middle. This sort of thing is more clear when a single cell spans only two rows: <table style="background:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;width:20em" class="inflection-table"><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0">1</th><td>first</td><td rowspan="2">both</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0">2</th><td>second</td></tr></table> because then it doesn't end up aligning with either of them.
: So, how can we make it more clear? Some ideas:
:* If the table-cells themselves had borders or backgrounds, then it would be clear that the plural cells are three rows tall.
:* We can simply output the plural forms three times. Unfortunately, this will obscure the fact that there's really just ''one'' plural form (as opposed to three plural forms that happen to be identical for a given verb).
:* We can move the plural forms to the "first-person" row, and use double-quotes as a "ditto" symbol in the next two rows.
:* We can restructure the table completely, maybe something like this: <table style="background:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;width:{{{width|30}}}em" class="inflection-table"><tr><th style="font-size:80%;">[[indicative mood|indicative]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[present tense|present]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[preterite]]</th></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">[[first person|1st-person]] [[singular]]</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{2}}}}}</td><td>{{lang|ang|{{{8}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">[[second person|2nd-person]] singular</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{3}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|{{{9}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">[[third person|3rd-person]] singular</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{4}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|{{{10}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">[[plural]]</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{5}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|{{{11}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:80%;">[[subjunctive]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[present tense|present]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[preterite]]</th></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">singular</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{6}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|{{{12}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">plural</th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{7}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|{{{13}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:80%;">[[imperative]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF" colspan="2"></th></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">singular</th><td colspan="2">{{lang|ang|{{{14}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left">plural</th><td colspan="2">{{lang|ang|{{{15}}}}}</td></tr><tr><th style="font-size:80%;">[[participle]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[present]]</th><th style="font-size:80%; background-color:#EFEFFF">[[past]]</th></tr><tr><th style="font-size:90%; background-color:#FFFFE0" align="left"></th><td>{{lang|ang|{{{16}}}}}</td><td >{{lang|ang|(ġe){{{17}}}}}</td></tr></table> I think that's my preference, actually.

==Splitting in two==

I think it would be best to split the template in two, if that hasn't already been done. One template provides only the table and the other template(s) provide the appropriate forms. A lot of languages have switched to that kind of system already and it works really well. I think it would work nicely for OE too, with 3 templates: weak, strong and irregular. —[[User:CodeCat|CodeCa]][[User talk:CodeCat|t]] 20:52, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
: There's no real need to split the template, per se: this template is already more or less identical to that approach's template-that-provides-only-the-table. If you want to create additional templates that take fewer arguments and really construct the various forms, they can use this one as their back-end, if you see what I mean. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 20:58, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
:: Update: I've created {{temp|ang-conj-strong-I}}, based on [[[[scinan]]]] (where one could use {{temp|ang-conj-strong-I|sc|n|sc|n}}, or just {{temp|ang-conj-strong-I|sc|n}}). The only awkwardness IMHO is {{temp|ang-conj}}'s prefixing of <tt>(ġe)</tt> to the past participle, which means that we can only link to the unprefixed form. But I just put it up for demonstration: it's up to Old English editors whether they actually use it. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 21:30, 6 January 2011 (UTC)

:::: Or calling entry: there won't always be a calling template, I don't think, since there will always be words with peculiarities that a general template can't handle. (Consider {{m|ang|ċēosan}}, for example, with its alternation between &lt;s&gt; and &lt;r&gt;.) Anyway, I think it's best to leave it for now. If and when individual entries almost all use intermediate templates, it will be easier to change that in just a few places without breaking existing pages. Alternatively, we can use {{temp|isValidPageName}} on that parameter, and add <tt>(ġe)</tt> if and only if the parameter is the bare past participle. —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 22:03, 6 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::: I have no idea.

These actually seem almost identical, since all the values are specified by hand with no defaults, it seems to be just the title that changes. I've started {{temp|ang-conj}}, right now we don't need more than that, we could use a <code>{{{switch}}}</code> to do the title and the categorization.

One difference: previously anomalous verbs had a black background with white text for their headers; but since the new template includes links in the header-bar (an appendix-link and a show/hide-link), and since link colors are determined elsewhere and unlikely to be very readable against black, the new template uses the same light-blue header background for anomalous verbs as for verbs of unspecified type.

*I very much doubt it. The OE Wiktionary is run by a tiny group of fannish types who aren't necessarily taking a very scholarly or standardised approach to anything. Working without diacritics is the only way to do it: the manuscripts didn't use any, and as you've seen, there is huge variation in published version over whether to use acute accents (which was common till about 20 years ago) or macrons (which is preferred by current editors). Circumflexes for long vowels is something I've rarely seen, but it's common for French editors to do that with lots of ancient languages. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx">[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 09:17, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

== Inflection-line tables ==

[[WT:Beer_parlour_archive/2010/May#Does_anybody_still_want_inflection-line_tables.3F|Recently in the BP]] you were for inflection-line tables, saying they "clearly mark out the POS line on a page". I agree we should highlight our definitions (PoS section) better. I've just found, however, that in addition to the problems mentioned before, our current way makes output look bad for several mobile gateways and apps (even those designed for newer phones).  As you can see from viewing ''house'' through [http://wapedia.mobi/enwiktionary/Special:Search?search=thesaurus&skl=Go&searchtype= wapedia] and [http://en.wiktionary.7val.com/;fitMlBoxIDarticle=78463a3/wiki/thesaurus#articleNavigation Sevenval], these sites show both the inflection line ''and'' the table, which I think we can agree is confusing and ugly. How would you feel if we got rid of the tables but found another way to highlight the inflection line? What about something like:

<syntaxhighlight lang="CSS">.infl-inline { background-color: #ADFFD6; }</syntaxhighlight>

== [[deal]] ==

I am frustrated a bit by this entry's division of noun senses by etymology. To some extent, it is artificial to split by etymology at all as it looks as if the Old English noun and verb are themselves cognates. OTOH, some of the modern senses of the noun seem to be more clearly associated with senses of the verb. Finally, I simply can't get decide which of the existing etymologies is appropriate for [[big deal]] and "the [[real deal]]". The quantificational noun sense of "deal", the non-obsolete Ety 1 sense, has a different flavor than the others, being more of a function word than a meaning-bearer. In etymology 2, noun, the obsolete sense and some other senses don't seem to fit very well and seem closer to Ety 1.

Would it not be simpler and still consistent with the facts to simply have an etymology for the noun and one for the verb? What am I missing? [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  19:58, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

*Well you say "the noun" and "the verb", but the point is that there are two nouns (well three actually, but for the moment let's confine ourselves to Etymologies 1 and 2). Ety 1 is a noun which we inherited from an OE noun. However, as you rightly point out, "some of the modern senses of the noun seem to be more clearly associated with senses of the verb". Exactly so, which is dealt with by Ety 2. This is a word which was primarily a verb, but under the verb is a noun section which shows all those words which have developed from the verb (and that includes "big deal"). It would not be consistent with the facts to have one etymology for all the noun uses and another for the verb; as for whether it would be simpler or not, well, maybe, but English is unfortunately not very helpful in that respect. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx">[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 04:55, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

:I also had ignored Etymology 3. I have often labored to tease apart related etymologies to provide users with intelligible groupings of senses. I don't disagree with the presentation, but I am uncertain about value of separating items derived from the OE noun and its cognate OE verb. I took an extreme position in part because I have read at BP comments from those who would seem to reduce such complexities, presumably in the interests of making it easier for a naive user to find all current senses in a given PoS. 
:Specifically, the informal senses in Etymology 2, "situation" and [[big deal]], "unspecified object", and "the [[real deal]]" don't seem so clearly associated with Etymology 2. I am wondering how I can better understand the logic of this kind of association of meaning with Etymology and, for that matter, sense evolution in general.

It is still a current practice (albeit an uncommon one) to alter the pronunciation of words ending in {{term||-y}} to terminate in {{IPAchar|/aɪ/}}, rather than the standard {{IPAchar|/ɪ/}}, in poëtry to form rhymes. I regret that I can't think of a more recent example of this done to the word {{term||symmetry}} than that 1794 work, but surely the principle still applies, wouldn't you say? You said that "[symmetry]'s not pronounced like that any more", but AFAIK that was ''never'' its ordinary pronunciation.

== [[wæron]] ==

A few years ago you created [[ƿæron]] as an alternative form of [[wæron]]... which we don't have. I'd imagine it's a verb form, however. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 15:19, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

== Tremas for Old French ==

It seems to me the trema is always optional in Old French - [[marier]] vs. [[marïer]]. It seems to have as much to do with the transcription of the original text as it does the actual spelling - should we get rid of these or not? My instinct is to keep them as they are actually used (in modern 'Unicode' versions, at least). [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 11:07, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

Hello. Why did you revert my edits to [[forlorn hope]]? — [[User:Lexicografía|lexicógrafo]] | [[User talk:Lexicografía|háblame]] — 12:02, 19 September 2010 (UTC)
*Because you removed the original definition.

== Stuff found while making categories ==

Hey. I know it *might* be hard since it's Old English we're talking about here but could you create entries for [[stæl|stǣl]] and [[-wierþe]]? While looking for categories to make I found that there were two English (modern) entries that were allegedly suffixed with the aforementioned suffix, which of course is not true.

== translations as quotes ==

Hello, your comment at [[Talk:make a clean breast]] caught my attention again. Do you have any recommendations on the best way to format translated citations? I'd like to add some more Jules Verne quotations to the website, but am not sure of the way to format them. I'd appreciate some tips. --[[User:SixTwo|SixTwo]] 17:18, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

:Do you have any thoughts on how to decompose the work on grammaticized words into chunks that less linguistically sophisticated type can do? The idea would be to make it easier for someone like you to finish off the entry. I imagine that simply finding contemporary that a contributor 'thinks' might match each sense would give later contributors something to chew on. Does restoring missing senses from Webster 1913 help? [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  14:48, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
::Dude, sorry, but I don't quite understand the question! <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 17:25, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
:::You indicated above that you won't tackle such an entry again soon. We certainly need you and others to tackle such entries. From looking at the great work on hard entries that you and Visviva have done and my own painful experience on less hard entries, it seems that there is a lot of painful focused work required to improve the entries for the most common English words, especially grammaticized ones like prepositions, auxiliary verbs, determiners, basic (non -ly) adverbs, etc. Splitting and recombining senses and identifying missing senses of such words is perhaps the hardest defining work that I have attempted. Such concentrated work by volunteers is not a great fit with human nature (at least in my experience). 
:::What could other people do to make it easier for you to do the final work to complete such entries? I am thinking that we could make some of the work a bit more like cleanup, which seems to fit the level of attention, effort, and skill most usually available from our contributors. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  18:11, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
::Oh I see, sorry! Er – that's quite hard, I don't know. I like to start with a lot of citations and work up – if you just pick ten uses of a common word you often find we are missing the right definitions to describe how it's used. For something massive like {{term|of}}, I also roughly modelled the primary sense break-down on the OED entry. But apart from increasing the citation pool, there's not that much to do except tackle the grammar and if you don't feel comfortable doing it, then don't worry about it. Eventually you will find citations that don't fit the page, and that's when entries get improved. But if there's a particular entry you have in mind, raise it at the Tea Room or just let me know. And thanks! <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 20:52, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
:::Do you find the MW 1913 definitions useful?
:::I suspect that we could take almost any one-morpheme preposition and find it deficient. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  23:02, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
::Yeah, maybe – if they're not already covered then yes. Problem is they're always so badly written. <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 06:57, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
:::Perhaps we could include them all as an (invisible) comment in each entry, then delete or mark those that seem to be covered by senses included. Once that process is complete the remaining senses, preferably with modernized wording (at least) and citations could be rendered visible. The citations for the kind of grammatical terms that most need this are difficult to sieve from Google. The BYU corpora give one a better chance, though they seem likely to limit us to non-researcher access. The process of citing the older senses ought to help in identifying any newer usage. 
:::As I write this, I have a sense of dread about the process for a word like "of" or "in". I am reasonably sure that the users of entries for grammaticized terms will not be normal folks, but rather other contributors.

== Serments de Strasbourg ==

On my [[:fr:Discussion_utilisateur:Mglovesfun#+ancien français|French user talk]], Diligent asked about the Oaths of Strasbourg. I know there seems to be a bit of debate whether this is Old French or Gallo-Romance. To complicate things on en.wikt. {{temp|roa-gal}} already exists so if we were to use it as a separate language, we'd need a more inventive template name. Perhaps the best thing would be to call these Old French, but use usage notes/context labels to show that they are ''very early'' Old French. [[User:Mglovesfun|Mglovesfun]] ([[User talk:Mglovesfun|talk]]) 14:25, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

== Your recent edit to [[Prince Charming]] ==

Please don't merge these two definitions of "Prince Charming" as you did in [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Prince_Charming&curid=546916&diff=11208884&oldid=11208881 this edit]. The first is a common fictional character who is simultaneously a prince and a hero. The second is a romantic subject, which may or may not be a prince, or a hero, and may or may not be chosen by a real woman. --[[User:Daniel.|Daniel.]] 02:34, 25 December 2010 (UTC)
*In my opinion, the first is encyclopaedic and only the second is suitable for a dictionary. That is why I viewed it as a single definition (I didn't "merge" them; I created the entry with a single definition and you, or someone, split it into two). <{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}} class="latinx" {{#if:|lang="{{{lang}}}"}}>[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</{{#switch:|term|ital=i|head|bold=b|span}}> 03:55, 25 December 2010 (UTC)
**There would be effectively no difference between using the words "merge" or "unsplit" in my message above. In my opinion, all or most stock characters are very much worthy of being defined here. As a result, I personally endorse the existence of other definitions that fit into this group, such as [[superhero]], [[mermaid]] and [[fairy godmother]]. --[[User:Daniel.|Daniel.]] 04:07, 25 December 2010 (UTC)

This template is for Old English weak class 1 verbs. It should take three main parameters, and can take a few others that might be useful.

==Usage==
The '''first parameter''' handles the '''infinitive and present forms''' ''(except for the 2nd and 3rd person singular present indicative)''.

The '''second parameter''' works for the '''2nd and 3rd person singular present indicative''', which can usually have different forms to the other present forms. If epenthetic vowels are present in these forms, they should be included in the parameter, e.g.: <code>|dēme|</code> will show up as <code>dēmest</code> and <code>dēmeþ</code>.

The '''third parameter''' handles the '''past tense forms'''. The preterite dental suffix should be included in the parameter, e.g.: <code>|dēmd|</code> will show up as <code>dēmde</code>, <code>dēmdest</code> and so on.

==Different forms==

If the '''singular present indicative forms''' don't match those forms given by this template; you can enter them separately by using <code>|1sg=|</code>, <code>|2sg=|</code> or <code>|3sg=|</code>.

In the case of the '''plural present subjunctive''' forms not matching the forms given by this template; you can instead use <code>|subj_pl=|</code> in order to separately enter them.

Sometimes the '''singular imperative''' or '''plural imperative''' forms will not match the form given by this template; instead, use the parameters <code>|imp=|</code> and <code>|imp_pl=|</code> respectively to enter them separately.

If the form of the '''past participle''' does not match the form present in this template, use the parameter <code>|pp=|</code> to enter it separately. There is also a variant, <code>|pp_g=|</code>, which provides the parenthetical '''(ġe)''', if needed.

==Dutch Low Saxon==

===Verb===
{{head|nds-nl|verb}}

# {{alternative spelling of|nds-nl|gaon}}

----

==Irish==

===Etymology===
From {{inh|ga|sga|cen|t=besides; without}}, from {{inh|ga|cel-pro|*kina|t=on this side of}}; compare {{cog|wlm|amgen|am-'''gen'''|t=otherwise}}, {{cog|br|ken|t=otherwise}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|unstressed}} {{IPA|ga|/ɡən̪ˠ/}}
* {{a|stressed|Munster|Aran}} {{IPA|ga|/ɡɑn̪ˠ/}}
* {{a|stressed|Connemara|Mayo|Ulster}} {{IPA|ga|/ɡan̪ˠ/}}

===Preposition===
{{ga-prep|n|l-}}

# [[without]]
# [[not]] {{qualifier|in conjunction with a verbal noun}}

====Usage notes====
* Triggers {{ga-mut-link|l}} of ''b, c, g, m, p'' on unmodified nouns, e.g. {{m|ga|gan [[pingin|phingin]]|t=without a penny}}. Does not trigger lenition on modified nouns, e.g. {{m|ga|gan pingin ina [[póca|phóca]]|t=without a penny in his pocket}}. In the meaning ‘not’, does not trigger lenition on either a verbal noun or on the direct object of the verbal noun, e.g. ''gan {{l|ga|ceannaigh|ceannach}}'' ‘not to buy’, ''gan {{l|ga|pingin}} a shaothrú'' ‘not to earn a penny’.

* Unlike most Irish prepositions, ''gan'' governs the nominative, not the dative, and it does not form prepositional pronouns: {{m|ga|gan [[an]] t-[[arán]]|t=without the bread}}, {{m|ga|gan [[mé]]|t=without me}}.

====Usage notes====
Old English used several different words to mean "to know":

* '''''Witan''''' meant "to be aware of," and was used with facts and pieces of information: ''Iċ <u>wāt</u> þæt iċ nāt nāwiht'' ("I <u>know</u> that I know nothing"), ''Hwā <u>wāt</u> hū fela ōðerra manna sind mē ġelīċe?'' ("Who <u>knows</u> how many other people are like me?"), ''Hwanon <u>wāst</u> þū mīnne naman?'' ("How do you <u>know</u> my name?").

* '''''[[cunnan|Cunnan]]''''' meant "to be familiar with," and was used with people, places, concepts, and skills: ''Mæġ iċ hine lufian swīðor þonne iċ hine <u>cann</u>?'' ("Can I love him more than I <u>know</u> him?"), ''Ne sorge ġē, iċ <u>cann</u> þis sċræf swā mīne æfteweardan hand'' ("Don't worry, I <u>know</u> this cave like the back of my hand"), ''Ealdenglisċ <u>cunnan</u> þyncþ mē unnytlīċ'' ("<u>Knowing</u> Old English seems useless to me"). With verbs, it means "to know how": ''Þū āna <u>cūðest</u> mē hreddan'' ("You're the only person who <u>knew how to</u> save me"), ''Wiston ġit þæt hē singan <u>cann</u>?'' ("Did you know he <u>can</u> sing?")

* '''''[[gecnawan|Ġecnāwan]]''''' and '''''[[oncnāwan]]''''' meant to recognize or identify, and could be used almost interchangeably: ''Þā stefne iċ wolde āhwǣr <u>ġecnāwan</u>'' ("I'd <u>know</u> that voice anywhere"), ''<u>Ġecnǣst</u> þū þisne wer?'' ("Do you <u>know</u> this man?"), ''Hēo <u>oncnǣþ</u> horan þonne hēo āne ġesiehþ'' ("She <u>knows</u> a whore when she sees one"), ''Be þām <u>oncnāwaþ</u> ealle menn þæt ġē sind mīne frīend'' ("That's how everyone <u>will know</u> you're my friends"). Though {{m|ang|cnāwan}} is the ancestor of modern ''know'' and was probably a synonym, it was many times less common than these two prefixed forms in the Old English period, being attested only a few times in the surviving corpus.

Hi. Some of your additions to ''farseer'' etc. seem to be a made-up form of alternative English that wouldn't be used by real speakers. Examples need to be realistic (or, even better, actual print citations). [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 16:26, 6 June 2017 (UTC)
            - Answer: I fully agree and see your point, I have taken it out {{unsigned|Anglish4699}}
:: As Equinox said in an edit comment, you shouldn't be using obscure senses of words in entries for other terms. The reason for definitions and glosses is for people to be able to understand as easily as possible. When you insert things that people don't understand, they then have to look then up. That may be what ''you'' want, because you want people to learn about those obscure terms, but it's not what the readers want, and it violates our neutral point of view principle. Please also remember that we're a descriptive dictionary: we document how the language is or has been used, not how you or I think it ought to be used. The kind of usage you're interested in exists, but it's extremely rare and most would consider it nonstandard. Don't try to make it seem more widespread or standard than it is. It should tell you something that most of your edits have been reverted or otherwise removed. If you persist in making edits that we keep having to revert, we might have to block you. Please don't make it come to that. Thanks! [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 00:03, 12 June 2017 (UTC)

== Synchronic etymologies ==

Synchronic etymologies, which only show the formation of the word, don't have cognates. Cognates are words that have a common origin, i.e. they were formed once in an ancestral language, and then inherited into their modern form. Parallel formations, where the same word was formed in multiple languages, are not cognates. There must demonstrably be a common ancestor form for there to be cognates. —[[User:CodeCat|Rua]] ([[User talk:CodeCat|mew]]) 16:45, 24 September 2017 (UTC)

== Cognates ==

I generally remove cognates if they are already listed as descendants on the page of an ancestral term, or if they can be expected to be listed there in the future. Descendants are much clearer and more useful for listing cognates, certainly better than cluttering up individual etymologies with them. Listing them in entries also leads to a lot of unnecessary duplication. —[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 18:33, 8 October 2017 (UTC)

== [[bestehen]] ==

I just noticed your edit summaries here. As far as I can tell, {{m|gem-pro|*stāną}} and {{m|gem-pro|*standaną}} were perfect synonyms of each other, and were used interchangeably. Inevitably, then, the derived verbs appear with both base forms too, so both {{m|gem-pro|*bistāną}} and {{m|gem-pro|*bistandaną}} are attested in languages, perhaps even the same language. I'm not sure what the best solution is. Clearly, they are more than just synonyms, they are more like alternative forms of each other. I'm inclined to treat {{m|gem-pro|*standaną}} and its derived verbs as the primarily lemma and {{m|gem-pro|*stāną}} as the alternative form, although the descendants of both should be kept separate. My reasoning is that Gothic preserves only the latter, and the root of the latter is also used in derived terms such as {{m|gem-pro|*standaz}}, even in languages which use the other form of the verb. —[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 18:44, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
: I had the same concern. Since the English {{m|en|stand}} didn't directly come from {{m|gem-pro|*stāną}}, I didn't quite know what to do here. Indeed they are more than just synonyms (the Proto-Germanic verbs even shared the same past conjugation), and I believe your answer to this problem is the best. [[User:Anglish4699|Anglish4699]] ([[User talk:Anglish4699|talk]]) 18:58, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
:: My own rule for creating etymologies is that if the current term derives from a form that is ''not'' the main lemma but rather an alternative form, I list both the main lemma and the alternative form, in that order. Look at how I did {{m|nl|beduiden}} for example. I think this same approach can be done for {{m|de|bestehen}}. —[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 19:01, 8 October 2017 (UTC)

== Old English conjugations ==

Hi Anglish4699 ! I just saw your edit on {{m|ang|crēopan}}, especially the mutstem argument ''crȳp''. Since we both do a lot of editing on OE, what do you feel is the best solution to the verb conjugations regarding their displayed forms ? 1). there is the train of thought that says that we should only use attested verb forms (where available); and 2). that we can normalise the forms (based on analogy to other similar verbs and etymology). I'm fine with either, but I am a stickler for consistency. Which do you feel is the way we should approach this ? [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 17:52, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
: Or maybe we can show an alternative: as in mutstem=*crīep|mutstem2=crȳp ? this might require reworking the template...[[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 17:55, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
::I think the best way to go about this is to show the generalized form as well as the attested form (since it is attested). Indeed, the generalized form may very well have been in Old English .

== inh vs. der ==

I've noticed you ask this question often in the edit summary. Not sure what the hard distinction is between the two, but I pretty much stick to this rule: When a term comes immediately from a previous stage of the same language, and if the word is the same POS as its predecessor, and it has all the components parts (affixes) of its predecessor, then it's an inherited term--assuming there was no break in usage, and no derivational change to the term occurred. Otherwise, if it there is an affix added (e.g. Middle English {{m|enm|hovel}}) from Old English {{m|ang|hof}}, or if it was a noun in say, Old English, but became a verb in Middle English (see {{m|en|whelm}} as an example), etc., then it becomes a derived term at that point--a change in the form/POS occurred. Same thing applies at the PIE to PGmc juncture, if the PIE is a stem (ends in *"-") and the PGmc term is a full word, then it's derived from that stem. But if the PIE word is fully reconstructed, then inherited can and should be utilised. And obviously, for terms borrowed at previous stages between languages, it's derived. Some may have differing opinions on this, and they are welcome to chime in. Hope this helps :) [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 18:38, 24 December 2017 (UTC)
: This is pretty much how I use it. As soon as there's a "break" of any sort in the chain of continuous inheritance of the same word, anything from that point backwards is not an inheritance. The {{temp|inh}} template actually barks at you if you give it a language that isn't an ancestor of the current one, so that is also a hint. But even within a chain of inheritance of ''languages'' there can still be a break. English is a direct descendant of PIE, so it can inherit and has inherited terms from it. But {{m|en|hound}} is not inherited from {{m|ine-pro|*ḱwṓ}}; at some point, an additional -t- was added, which then became -d- to give {{m|gem-pro|*hundaz}}. {{m|gem-pro|*hundaz}} is the oldest known ancestor of {{m|en|hound}}, anything older is not inherited. —[[User:Rua|Rua]] ([[User talk:Rua|mew]]) 18:59, 24 December 2017 (UTC)
::My biggest reason for putting an English term as "derived" is that there is such a big date gap between Middle English and New English (kinda like what happened at {{m|en|withspeak}}) (1) OR I cannot find the Middle English term with the source that I have now (like with {{m|en|behelm}} from Middle English {{m|enm|*bihelmen}} {{m|enm|*behelmen}} from Old English {{m|ang|behelmian}} (2). In those situations, I feel like I'm in a pickle, and put the "inh? der?." I wanted to be careful and not mark something as "inherited" when it wasn't, but I will indeed keep those helpful rules above in mind! [[User:Anglish4699|Anglish4699]] ([[User talk:Anglish4699|talk]]) 04:01, 25 December 2017 (UTC)
:::I gotcha, but I'm not sure that der would have been the correct one to use in those situations either, however, I agree its use has become sort of a ''catch-all'' for situations that seem unclear. So for words not attested in Middle English, but likely from Old English, they are inherited. Take for instance the word {{m|en|stay|t=a mast rope}}, it's obviously inherited from OE {{m|ang|stæġ}}, as it follows all the classic phonological changes of passing through Middle English, however without any written record of it. It's not derived, per se. Even if there is a gap, like with {{m|en|withspeak}}, that would make it a (re)borrowing, not a derivation. der really should only be used when something is a derivative of a word (like ''happily'' from ''happy'', ''freedom'' from ''free'', etc.), but we have come to also use it for borrowings from other languages at earlier stages because we don't want it categorising the terms the way that bor does, at the most recent stage of the language, hence the ''catch-all'' use [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 06:28, 25 December 2017 (UTC)

== affix vs. prefix/suffix ==

Hi there !
Just saw your edit to {{m|en|halfdead}}. I undid it, because I think there is a push to use the more universal ''affix'' template, which can be used for both prefixes and suffixes, so it's cleaner/more efficient vs. the prefix/suffix. Granted, I still haven't converted over yet fully myself, and you don't really have to either if you don't want to, but I think it's a sensible step we might all want to consider making :) [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 03:00, 30 December 2017 (UTC)
::So if you choose not to use it, prefix/suffix is fine, but we certainly don't want to undo all the work someone's already made in converting to affix ;) [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 03:03, 30 December 2017 (UTC)
::: Okay, I will do so from now on. Thank for letting me know! [[User:Anglish4699|Anglish4699]] ([[User talk:Anglish4699|talk]]) 03:04, 30 December 2017 (UTC)

Hi ! I see you added a request for more etymological information at {{m|en|flatten}}. Is ''flat'' + ''-en'' not enough ? [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 23:02, 5 February 2018 (UTC)
